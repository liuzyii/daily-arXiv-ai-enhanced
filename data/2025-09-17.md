Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割和重建算法的泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并提升了术前规划和患者教育效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在跨数据集泛化方面存在困难，需要开发能够准确分割解剖结构并适用于多样化数据集的算法，以支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，采用三阶段流程：数据匿名化和手动分割、配准和分割（全乳腺、纤维腺体组织和肿瘤）、ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化。使用人机协同方法通过U-Mamba架构优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba在T1加权图像上表现出色：全器官DSC 0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织0.96±0.024，肿瘤0.82±0.12。模型生成准确的3D重建，临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过3D可视化提升了患者教育和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络自动分割辐照后TRISO颗粒的微观截面图像，以替代传统人工分析方法，提高效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工分析辐照后TRISO颗粒微观结构变化耗时且主观，需要自动化方法来加速数据分析并减少主观性

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在IoU指标上表现最佳，能够显著减少人工劳动并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效加速TRISO颗粒截面分析，为核燃料辐照性能研究提供高效客观的分析工具

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个分层管道，用于作物异常检测和状态估计，包括高效的自动编码器异常检测和两种不同复杂度的状态估计方法（植被指数+随机森林 vs 原始图像+Vision Transformer），在资源受限环境下实现实时优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然快速但计算密集，难以在资源受限条件下部署。需要开发灵活高效的方法来实现实时作物监测和养分管理。

Method: 使用多光谱成像数据，构建分层管道：1）自动编码器用于早期异常检测；2）比较两种状态估计模块：植被指数特征+随机森林（低复杂度）和原始图像+Vision Transformer（高复杂度）。通过养分耗竭实验（三种施肥强度处理）进行验证。

Result: 高效异常检测（移植后9天检测到73%的T3样本），能耗远低于浪费氮素的体现能量。状态估计显示权衡关系：ViT在磷和钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，能够在资源受限环境下实现高效的作物监测和养分管理优化。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型理解多模态幽默和叙事序列的能力。实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现，揭示了模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面的严重局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战。需要开发专门的基准来评估和改进模型在多模态幽默理解和叙事推理方面的能力。

Method: 创建PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，设计实验评估最先进LMMs在多模态幽默理解和面板排序任务上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现，表明模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了一个严谨框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社会意识交互的LMMs，当前模型在多模态幽默理解方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线人机交互生成与感知新任务，基于Mamba框架开发了OnlineHOI架构，在流式数据处理中通过记忆机制整合历史信息，在多个在线任务上取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人机交互方法主要在离线设置下工作，能够访问整个交互序列信息。但现实场景中信息只能从当前时刻和历史数据获取，离线方法在在线环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了OnlineHOI框架，基于Mamba框架构建网络架构，采用记忆机制来有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba对流式数据的强大建模能力。

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及在线HOI4D感知任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Conclusion: 在线人机交互处理是一个重要且具有挑战性的任务，提出的OnlineHOI框架通过结合Mamba和记忆机制，成功解决了离线方法在在线环境中的性能问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度学习技术特别是Deepfake的双面性，既展示了技术进步也带来了隐私、声誉和国家安全方面的严重风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术在实际应用中产生的正面和负面影响，特别是Deepfake技术对社会各个层面的潜在危害。

Method: 通过分析深度学习技术在不同领域的应用案例，重点研究Deepfake技术的工作原理及其滥用可能造成的后果。

Result: 发现Deepfake技术能够产生难以辨别的伪造图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统功能，对个人隐私、公众人物声誉和国家安全构成重大威胁。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术虽然带来了革命性进步，但其滥用特别是Deepfake技术的恶意使用，对社会造成了多方面的负面影响，需要加强监管和技术防范措施。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置(SB)与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置(SB)影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，大型模型中的SB测量及其与图像分类任务的关系尚不清楚。

Method: 提出频率感知的SB测量方法，在CLIP模型上验证该方法，并分析SB与零样本和微调设置下图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；强SB与OOD泛化性能正相关，但与对抗鲁棒性关系不同；模型归纳偏置与目标任务特征对齐有益。

Conclusion: SB测量需要针对大型模型设计新方法，SB强度与任务性能的关系因任务特性而异，调整模型偏置以匹配任务特征可提升性能。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图神经网络的多类别皮肤镜分类框架，融合了图像、毫米级校准和元数据，在ISIC数据集上显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的皮肤镜AI系统通常只使用图像数据，忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和用于几何分析所需的物理尺度信息

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过轻量级1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含元数据和几何相似性的图结构，使用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分数分别为0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏图变体使用约25%边仍保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于仅图像基线的0.9440

Conclusion: 将校准尺度、病变几何和元数据统一在群体图中相比仅图像流程有显著提升，稀疏图保持接近最优精度，尺度感知的图基AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了位置感知文本图像机器翻译（PATIMT）任务，构建了包含10个真实场景的基准测试集PATIMTBench，并开发了自适应OCR优化流程，使紧凑型大视觉语言模型在该任务上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本图像机器翻译仅关注全图像翻译，忽略了位置信息和细粒度翻译需求。实际应用中需要支持布局保持的精细翻译，这一领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出PATIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和带定位的全图像翻译两个子任务。构建包含10个多样化场景的PATIMTBench基准，开发自适应OCR优化流程根据场景选择合适OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的结果。

Result: 经过数据微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能。实验结果表明训练数据具有良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的基准测试和方法为位置感知文本图像翻译提供了有效解决方案，展示了紧凑模型在该任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架解决SAR与光学图像间的跨模态域自适应问题，通过相似性引导和记忆引导机制提升船舶尾迹检测的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像具有全天候观测能力但特征抽象噪声多，光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域自适应挑战

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制，引入特征-置信度记忆库和K近邻置信加权融合策略，结合区域混合训练

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态船舶尾迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的域自适应问题，验证了方法的有效性和可行性

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过深度学习结合物理机制，生成美国本土2公里分辨率、每小时更新的无缝气温数据，验证精度达1.93°C


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象站提供连续监测但空间覆盖有限，卫星提供广域覆盖但存在云遮挡问题，缺乏时空无缝的高分辨率气温数据

Method: 使用神经网络编码年温度周期，通过线性项放大ERA5温度值，卷积层捕捉时空变化，先重建云遮挡的GOES-16地表温度，再转换为气温，采用深度集成学习进行不确定性估计

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站记录（2018-2024年）测试，站点验证达到1.93°C的每小时气温制图精度

Conclusion: 该方法实现了地表温度重建和气温预测的流程化，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

### [12] [DS@GT AnimalCLEF: Triplet Learning over ViT Manifolds with Nearest Neighbor Classification for Animal Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12353)
*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS@GT团队在AnimalCLEF 2025重识别挑战中发现，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于骨干嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。专业领域预训练模型比通用模型更适合细粒度重识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用预训练模型与领域特定预训练模型在动物重识别任务中的表现差异，探索后处理度量学习对不同类型骨干网络的有效性。

Method: 使用DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域特定模型）作为骨干网络，采用K近邻分类器进行个体识别，并测试三元组学习投影头对性能的提升效果。

Result: 三元组学习对专业模型MegaDescriptor提升0.13分，但对通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS指标）。通用模型的流形更难为细粒度任务重塑。

Conclusion: 通用预训练特征在专业化、数据有限的重识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特定预训练至关重要。通用模型的嵌入空间难以通过后处理有效优化。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at

*Florian Zager,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了GhostNetV3-Small模型，针对低分辨率输入进行优化，在CIFAR-10上达到93.94%准确率，发现架构调整比知识蒸馏更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在资源受限边缘设备上的部署问题，特别是针对低分辨率输入场景的模型压缩和适配需求

Method: 提出GhostNetV3-Small架构变体，并比较传统知识蒸馏、教师助手和教师集成等多种蒸馏技术

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3；所有蒸馏策略反而降低了准确率

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比知识蒸馏更具影响力，需要在低分辨率领域进一步研究有效的模型设计和先进蒸馏技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于无人机的生物多样性和保护监测提供了实用指导，推荐在实际部署中使用原始影像，并在训练中纳入树冠中心标注以获得更精确的树木定位。

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

*Mayank Patel,Rahul Jain,Asim Unmesh,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench基准数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的耦合运动轨迹，解决了传统方法依赖简化运动学结构或关节标注的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动分析通常假设简化的运动学结构或依赖关节标注，但对于齿轮等机械组件，运动是通过几何耦合（如啮合齿或对齐轴）产生的，难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮组件）和DYNAMO模型，这是一个依赖感知的神经网络模型，能够直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于数据驱动的CAD组件中耦合机械运动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Motivation: 棉花采摘依赖人工，效率低且易错过最佳收获期，需要准确识别棉花铃花成熟度来实现自动化收获和产量估算。

Method: 在YOLOv11n基础上改进卷积设计增强空间表示，引入NeLU增强的全局注意力机制捕捉弱特征，以及扩张感受野SPPF模块进行多尺度上下文建模。

Result: 在4966张图像数据集上达到91.5%精确率、89.8%召回率、93.3% mAP50、71.3% mAP和90.6% F1分数，仅需7.5 GFLOPs计算量。

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供可靠技术基础。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is
available at https://github.com/SweefongWong/Cott-ADNet.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段解耦框架TSDF用于可变长度青光眼预后预测，通过自监督学习整合多数据集特征表示，结合注意力机制处理变长序列输入，在OHTS和GRAPE数据集上验证有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有青光眼预后方法依赖固定长度历史序列数据，灵活性受限；端到端模型在有限数据集上表现不佳，需要解决多数据集整合和变长序列处理问题

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用自监督学习的特征表示模块整合多个青光眼数据集；第二阶段使用时序聚合模块，采用基于注意力的机制处理变长序列输入

Result: 在两个规模差异大的基准数据集OHTS和GRAPE上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，显著提升模型性能同时保持参数紧凑

Conclusion: TSDF框架能够灵活处理变长序列输入，有效整合多数据集资源，在青光眼预后预测任务中表现出优越性能，为临床实践提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的tokenizer训练方案，包括主训练和后训练，通过模拟生成过程中的噪声和优化解码器来减小重建与生成分布之间的差异，显著提升了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在预构建的潜在空间中捕获图像分布，但重建分布与生成分布存在显著差异。当前tokenizer仅关注重建任务，未考虑生成推理过程中的采样误差。

Method: 提出包含主训练和后训练的两阶段tokenizer训练方案。主训练采用潜在扰动策略模拟生成噪声，提升tokenizer鲁棒性；后训练针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器，减小生成与重建token的分布差异。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的离散tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，经过后训练后进一步提升至1.36 gFID。实验验证了该方法对离散和连续tokenizer以及自回归和基于扩散的生成器的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的tokenizer训练方案通过模拟生成噪声和优化解码器，有效解决了重建与生成分布差异问题，显著提升了生成模型性能，并提出了新的评估指标pFID来关联tokenizer性能与生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GRT（Generalizable Radar Transformer）基础模型，使用100万样本训练，能够从单芯片毫米波雷达数据预测3D占用和语义分割，性能接近高分辨率传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且不受环境条件影响，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大规模数据集，通常需要从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的大规模原始雷达数据集，训练了基于Transformer的基础模型GRT，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示。

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可微调适应不同任务，数据规模每增加10倍性能提升20%。原始数据使用相比有损表示相当于10倍数据增益。

Conclusion: 需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥GRT的潜力，为毫米波雷达感知提供了有效的通用基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估

Method: 使用包含光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影的受控扰动，结合基于词汇和神经相似性指标，在多个数据集上评估VLMs性能

Result: 发现真实标注的描述性显著影响性能；大模型在语义理解上表现优异但不总是优于小模型；JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声类型会显著降低所有模型性能

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特性和噪声恢复力之间的复杂权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在对象边界定位不精确和仅关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，利用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量边界感知定位图

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3% mIoU（后处理前），经过CRF细化后提升至86.6%，显著超越先前WSSS方法

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，在保持计算效率的同时实现了完整的对象覆盖和精确的边界划分，为缺乏像素级标注的场景提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from

3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出了MGNM多模态图网络模型，利用GNN的关系结构增强HOI检测，在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试HICO-DET和V-COCO上实现最先进性能，与更先进的目标检测器集成时表现出显著性能提升，并在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM方法通过显式建模关系结构和多级特征交互，有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了图神经网络在关系建模方面的优势

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有光照估计方法在恢复光照图细节纹理方面存在困难，或在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战

Method: 使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征避免后验坍塌，通过ViT捕获全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计建模为多分类任务

Conclusion: VQT-Light方法在定性和定量实验中都优于现有最先进方法，实现了轻量级快速的高质量光照估计

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

<details>

Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到视觉不可察觉的对抗攻击，但针对自动驾驶汽车LiDAR定位的攻击研究很少，大多数对抗攻击集中在3D感知领域

Method: 逆向工程定位模型（特征提取网络），识别关键关键点并策略性移除，破坏基于LiDAR的定位。使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界隐藏关键区域

Result: 在KITTI数据集上测试三种最先进的点云配准模型（HRegNet、D3Feat、GeoTransformer），移除包含Top-K关键点的区域显著降低配准精度。在Autoware平台上，隐藏少量关键区域即可引起明显的定位漂移

Conclusion: 该攻击框架验证了LiDAR定位系统的脆弱性，物理世界攻击成功证明了提案的真实性和通用性，为自动驾驶安全提供了重要警示

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角和光谱码本方法，能够有效区分和去除图像中的反射，在反射去除任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: CIARD方法有效解决了对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中的性能下降问题，通过创新的多教师框架和持续训练机制，在保持鲁棒性的同时显著提升了清洁样本性能

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Motivation: 现有多模态操纵检测基准存在跨模态不对齐问题，人工破坏了模态间的一致性，而真实世界的攻击通常保持语义一致性，这导致现有方法难以检测真实的语义协调操纵

Method: 1) 构建SAMM数据集：采用两阶段流程，先应用先进图像操纵技术，再生成上下文合理的文本叙述；2) 提出RamDG框架：利用外部知识库检索上下文证据，通过图像伪造定位和深度操纵检测模块进行多模态编码和操纵追踪

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态操纵检测领域的空白，提出的语义对齐数据集和检索增强框架为检测真实世界的语义协调多媒体操纵提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角地理定位中往往忽略空间和语义信息，难以处理显著的外观变化和提取判别性特征，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 提出MFAF方法，包含多频率分支块(MFB)捕获多尺度的低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，以及频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块自适应关注关键区域。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过多尺度频率特征提取和注意力机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s在水下图像检测任务上的性能进行了系统比较，发现YOLOv9后准确率趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在速度和精度平衡方面表现最佳，适合自主水下航行器部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像受光线衰减、浑浊度和类别不平衡等问题影响，而自主水下航行器的计算资源有限。需要评估不同YOLO版本在水下环境中的性能，为海洋视觉研究提供基准。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病和鱼类物种），创建四种训练规模（25%、50%、75%、100%图像），在相同超参数下训练四个YOLO变体，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后准确率趋于饱和，但推理速度持续提升。YOLOv10在速度和精度之间提供了最佳平衡，适合嵌入式AUV部署。

Conclusion: YOLOv10是水下图像检测任务的最佳选择，提供了首个近期YOLO变体的受控比较，为未来海洋视觉研究提供了可复现的基准和代码库。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based

the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather

across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集为解决真实世界火灾场景中的图像去烟问题提供了宝贵的基础，有助于提高应急响应和救援操作的效率。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the

TL;DR: RIS-FUSION：一个将红外-可见光图像融合与参考图像分割统一起来的级联框架，通过联合优化实现文本驱动的图像融合，在mIoU指标上超过现有方法11%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外-可见光图像融合方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估输入文本对融合结果的有效贡献。观察到参考图像分割（RIS）和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象

Method: 提出RIS-FUSION级联框架，核心是LangGatedFusion模块，将文本特征注入融合骨干网络以增强语义对齐。构建了MM-RIS大规模基准数据集，包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试三元组（红外-可见光图像对、分割掩码和参考表达式）

Result: 大量实验表明RIS-FUSION实现了最先进的性能，在mIoU指标上超过现有方法11%以上

Conclusion: 通过将融合和RIS任务统一起来进行联合优化，能够有效实现文本驱动的红外-可见光图像融合，显著提升语义对齐和分割性能

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: DeFA方法通过解构-重构特征增强和去偏策略，在组合零样本学习中实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组合零样本学习中属性和对象纠缠以及长尾分布问题，受神经科学发现启发，认为想象和感知共享相似神经过程

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，整合解构-重构特征增强框架和去偏策略，利用已见属性和对象的先验知识合成高保真组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上，DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置中都实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA方法通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了组合零样本学习的挑战，证明了其在组合泛化方面的有效性

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门解决视觉-语言模型中视觉和语言处理不对称的问题，通过三种专家组实现模态特定处理和跨模态交互，在减少参数的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言不对称性时面临挑战：视觉信息具有空间完整性，而语言需要保持序列上下文。深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础，过度依赖参数知识而非提供的多模态信息。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专家组：1）模态内专家处理特定模态特征；2）双曲跨模态专家进行分层跨模态交互；3）证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏见并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验表明，AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型激活参数减少25.45%。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在减少计算成本的同时显著提升了多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉长时程推理和记忆利用在部分可观测性和动态变化下的挑战。

Method: 设计了两个动态空间基准测试，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化，需要持续更新认知和策略。提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制来实现跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，该基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D表示，解决了多视图不一致性问题，同时支持复杂内部结构和开放表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型依赖多视图扩散先验，容易产生视图不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构或非平凡拓扑。需要一种能同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率的新方法。

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为紧凑的多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，在图像域操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验，支持高效微调。

Result: 大量实验表明SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的视图一致性问题，同时支持复杂内部结构表示，具有优异的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型越狱攻击的有效性和效率仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御机制整合到攻击流程中可以显著提升越狱效果

Method: 包含三个核心组件：视觉优化器（嵌入具有肯定语义的通用对抗扰动）、文本优化器（使用防御风格提示优化输入）、红队后缀生成器（通过强化微调增强越狱效果）

Result: 在4个VLM和4个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型越狱提供了新视角，展示了防御机制在攻击中的意外有效性

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Conclusion: WaveVerse提供了一个可扩展的RF感知仿真框架，能够生成高质量的RF数据，为室内感知任务提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法采用无差别属性分配导致梯度冲突和效率低下，需要更智能的高斯管理策略来提升重建质量和效率。

Method: 引入动态激活球谐函数或法向量的致密化策略，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶数，执行任务解耦剪枝来移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面均优于最先进方法，以显著更少的参数实现卓越性能，且方法具有模型无关性。

Conclusion: 提出的高斯管理方法有效解决了梯度冲突问题，在保持高质量重建的同时大幅减少了模型参数，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了深度可分离网络中学习到的8个"主键滤波器"，发现它们可以通过高斯核的离散模拟和差分算子来建模，证明了学习到的滤波器可以用离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野滤波器的数学特性，探索是否可以用理论模型来近似这些学习到的滤波器。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器空间分布的加权均值和方差，然后使用高斯核的离散模拟和差分算子来建模这些滤波器，通过两种不同的尺度参数设置和两种拟合方法（空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数）进行模型拟合。

Result: 理想化的感受野模型与学习到的滤波器在定性上表现出良好的相似性，实验结果表明用理想化滤波器替换学习到的滤波器具有良好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，这为理解深度网络中学习到的特征表示提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态LLM与人类在图像质量评估上的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等质量属性方面与人类存在显著不同


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本生成图像模型仍然具有挑战性，现有研究使用多模态LLM评估图像质量，但缺乏对LLM如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）进行整体评估的深入理解

Method: 首先使用合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，通过图像质量属性间的跨任务相关性分析人类判断机制；对LLM进行相同分析；生成针对每个质量属性的高控制度合成数据集进行个体属性研究

Result: 人类能够轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但多模态LLM在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上学习判断的能力较差；图像质量属性间的关系在LLM中比在人类中弱得多

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，为改进自动化图像质量评估提供了重要见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角目标地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归对象位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出循环定位框架，使用可学习token编码查询意图并迭代优化位置；引入SAM知识蒸馏策略传递分割先验知识；设计参考特征增强模块采用分层注意力机制突出目标相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时相比之前SOTA方法减少60%参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟且质量易受相机位姿不准、DSM误差和场景遮挡等问题影响，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 采用在线3D高斯优化方法，每获取一张新图像就通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成优化到未重建区域，结合正交投影渲染技术

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每个新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的高质量正射影像图生成，为实时地理空间应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

TL;DR: BATR-FST是一个用于少样本学习的双层次自适应token优化方法，通过token聚类、不确定性感知权重和双层次注意力机制，在Vision Transformers上显著提升了少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临token级交互优化不足、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不强等挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的token匹配或简单相似度度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征优化的有效整合。

Method: 提出BATR-FST双阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模提供可迁移的patch级表示；元微调阶段包含双层次自适应token优化模块（token聚类、不确定性感知token加权、双层次注意力机制）、图token传播确保支持集和查询集的语义一致性，以及类分离惩罚保持类间边界。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景下均取得了优异结果，显著提升了基于transformer的少样本分类性能。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式token表示优化和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的关键挑战，为少样本分类提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文表示学习网络，通过整合功能引导推理和上下文提示与视觉线索，来改进人-物交互检测，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法在上下文建模方面存在不足，无法充分捕捉复杂的人-物交互关系，特别是涉及工具等辅助实体的多元关系

Method: 扩展传统HOI检测框架，通过三元组结构<人,工具,物体>显式建模辅助对象的功能角色，使用可学习提示与上下文视觉特征通过注意力机制融合，实现语言与图像内容在全局和区域层面的对齐

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 上下文化表示学习为模型提供了丰富的关系线索，能够更可靠地推理复杂的、依赖上下文的交互关系

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 制造业视觉异常检测面临真实异常样本稀缺的问题，现有合成数据方法存在结构不一致和特征纠缠的局限性，需要新的生成框架来同时合成高质量的异常图像和标注掩码。

Result: 在多样性和真实性方面显著优于最先进方法，下游异常检测性能得到显著提升。

Conclusion: DH-Diff框架有效解决了合成异常数据中的结构一致性和特征纠缠问题，为视觉异常检测提供了高质量的合成训练数据。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: SPAM是一个新颖的超像素分割框架，结合深度学习特征提取和大规模预训练模型，能够生成既准确又规则的超像素分割结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但牺牲了超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，在推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与对象掩码对齐，支持处理任何先验高层分割和交互式对象聚焦

Result: 综合实验表明SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量都优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SPAM是一个有价值且鲁棒的工具，适用于各种应用场景

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

*Yuan Cao,Dong Wang*

TL;DR: SAGA提出选择性自适应门控机制，改进线性注意力中的KV信息压缩问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时提升性能，实现计算效率和模型效果的双重提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理高分辨率图像时面临二次复杂度的计算瓶颈。线性注意力虽然将复杂度降至线性，但现有的均匀压缩KV信息方法会导致特征冗余和方向对齐丢失，造成性能差距。

Method: 提出选择性自适应门控(SAGA)，通过输入自适应的可学习门控选择性调节KV特征图中的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束。同时提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法进行门计算，不增加额外内存开销。

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下，相比PVT-T实现1.76倍吞吐量提升和2.69倍峰值GPU内存降低。在ImageNet数据集上top-1准确率提升高达4.4%。

Conclusion: SAGA在线性注意力框架内有效解决了KV信息压缩的局限性，在计算效率和模型性能方面都取得了显著改进，为高分辨率视觉任务提供了高效的注意力机制解决方案。

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像基础模型受限于较小的数据集规模，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式对性能的影响，以理解如何在医疗领域有效利用大规模数据。

Method: 使用MedImageInsight（MI2，CLIP范式）和RAD-DINO（DINOv2范式）两种编码器，在350万张单机构胸部X光片上进行持续预训练，保持计算和评估协议一致，评估分类、分割和报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在放射学发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上更强；使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能；某些任务仅需3万张域内样本即可超越开源基础模型。

Conclusion: 机构特定的持续预训练具有重要价值，医疗机构利用域内数据可以获得显著性能增益，为医疗影像基础模型的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Conclusion: 结合不同感知基础的度量方法能够有效提升NeRF生成图像质量评估的准确性，融合策略在不同数据集和配置下表现稳定

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据在解决罕见疾病数据稀缺方面具有巨大潜力，虽然方法针对医学领域定制，但可适应其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为DevOps风格的目标检测器监控提供了稳健的基础，能够突出表现不佳的场景

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过MLLM组织模型级编辑工具，结合强化学习训练，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced

Method: 提出了基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法，以及解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，将文本和图像注意力分离以实现更精确的语义控制。

Result: 在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在保真度和可编辑性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的两个关键挑战，通过高阶反演和注意力解耦机制显著提升了生成质量和控制精度。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MEJO框架，通过共享-特定解耦学习和协调梯度学习策略，解决手术三元组识别中的任务间和任务内优化冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三元组识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有方法存在任务间表示纠缠导致的优化冲突和类别不平衡导致的训练冲突

Method: MEJO框架包含：1）S²D学习方案分解共享和特定表示；2）MLLM增强的概率提示池动态增强视觉特征；3）协调梯度学习策略重新平衡头尾类梯度

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上的广泛实验证明了该框架的优越性

Conclusion: 提出的MEJO框架有效解决了手术三元组识别中的优化冲突问题，提高了识别性能

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的导航任务缺乏对协作对话的全面评估，需要让引导者推断导航者的位置，使通信成为任务成功的关键因素。

Method: 收集并发布了RAIN数据集（人类对话配对导航轨迹），设计了综合基准评估导航和对话，分析了不同导航者和引导者模型的影响。

Result: 提出了DialNav任务和RAIN数据集，识别了关键挑战，为具身对话研究提供了数据、代码和评估框架。

Conclusion: DialNav任务和RAIN数据集为具身对话研究提供了重要基础，公开资源将促进该领域的未来发展。

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了跨层视觉平滑（CLVS）方法，通过视觉记忆机制让大视觉语言模型持续关注关键物体，从而提升视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型虽然能准确定位关键物体，但对其注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键物体可以提升模型的视觉能力

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制，在首层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化，后续层中联合考虑先前层的视觉记忆并迭代更新，通过不确定性指标判断视觉理解完成度来终止平滑过程

Result: 在4个基准测试和3个大视觉语言模型上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化性，在关系理解和属性理解任务上取得了显著提升

Conclusion: CLVS方法通过维持对关键物体的平滑注意力，有效提升了大视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，特别是在关系和属性理解方面表现突出

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图引导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在细节保持和结构清晰度方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习融合方法主要依赖低层次视觉特征（如纹理和对比度），难以捕捉图像中的高层次语义信息。虽然近期有尝试引入文本作为语义指导，但非结构化的描述无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，也缺乏空间定位能力，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合从文本和视觉中提取的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块同步优化高层次语义和低层次细节。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MSGFusion在细节保持和结构清晰度方面显著优于最先进方法，在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中展现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图的多模态引导，成功解决了红外与可见光图像融合中高层次语义信息捕获的挑战，为多模态图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换和补丁相似性评分，在医学影像中实现精确的异常定位和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成式异常检测方法在处理正常细粒度组织变异性（如肺部解剖结构）时的挑战，提高医学影像中异常检测和分割的准确性。

Method: 采用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建，然后通过观察图像与生成图像对的补丁相似性评分来实现精确的异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT扫描中检测感染性病变和在脑部MRI中分割缺血性卒中病变的任务中，相比其他最先进的重建方法，像素级异常分割的DICE分数分别提高了+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学影像异常检测和分割方面表现出优异的性能，具有良好的泛化能力，能够有效处理正常组织变异性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个基于时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过在SiamTPN架构中加入显式时间建模，解决了空中目标跟踪中的尺度变化、动态背景和遮挡问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽略时间依赖性，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性和特征表示能力。

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率提升13.7%，精确度提升14.7%。在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时运行，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大且高效的解决方案，适合实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩管道，结合稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS，仅损失少量检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测需要在不影响性能的前提下实现显著压缩，解决模型大小和计算复杂度问题。

Method: 三阶段压缩方法：1）稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2）利用批归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3）使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道知识蒸馏来恢复精度。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M（减少73.51%），FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%，推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS，结合TensorRT后达到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时显著压缩模型并提升推理速度，证明了在资源受限场景下实时部署的实用性。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法，相比现有的分类方法能够更精细地量化配准质量，通过多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制，在异构空间密度的点云上实现了准确鲁棒的配准误差估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准质量验证方法都将其视为分类任务，只能将配准质量划分为少数几个类别，无法进行精细量化。本文希望通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量评估。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，扩展了先前使用的错配准相关特征，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制。

Result: 在多样化数据集上实现了准确鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异构空间密度的点云上表现优异。当用于指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法相比分类方法能够提供更精细的质量量化，多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制有效提升了在异构点云上的性能，对下游任务有显著改进效果。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS是一个基于4D雷达增强的自监督3D重建框架，针对动态驾驶场景，通过雷达辅助的高斯初始化和速度引导的点跟踪模型，解决了现有方法在动态对象重建中的运动估计不精确和时间一致性弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在频率域解耦或光流的基础上，由于运动估计不精确和时间一致性弱，难以准确重建动态对象，导致动态场景元素的不完整或扭曲表示。

Method: 提出了4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态对象并恢复单目深度尺度；设计了速度引导的点跟踪模型（VGPT），在场景流监督下与重建管道联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上评估，4DRadar-GS在动态驾驶场景的3D重建中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态对象重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确和一致的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预分解对象级高斯和CLIP特征聚合的新方法，解决了3D高斯溅射在语义理解中的模糊性问题，实现了准确的开放词汇对象检索和任务适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在实时逼真渲染方面取得显著进展，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但存在alpha混合平均语义的根本限制。

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合表示每个对象，创建全面的"嵌入包"来整体描述对象。绕过可微分渲染语义，实现对象级嵌入比较和任务适应。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当，确保最小妥协。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D场景语义理解提供了范式转变的替代方案，通过对象级特征聚合实现了准确的开放词汇检索和灵活的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Conclusion: TMKT方法通过细粒度的时间步混合策略和模态感知学习目标，有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差距问题，为事件相机与SNN的高效能视觉处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的多模态多表面交互式分割方法，通过融合RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击来预测改进的分割掩码，显著减少了所需点击次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面同时存在于同一图像中的复杂分割问题，特别是当这些表面高度纠缠和相邻时的挑战，需要开发新的评估指标和方法来处理这种场景。

Method: 设计了一个网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、多个非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，预测改进的分割掩码。架构设计满足两个条件：RGB主干网络作为黑盒使用，交互特定信息在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成以减少响应时间。

Result: 多模态融合策略有效，在DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击（NoC@90），在MFNet上减少1.19次点击。RGB-only基线在经典单掩码交互分割场景中也表现出竞争性甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多表面交互分割的挑战，多模态输入显著提升了分割效率，同时保持了在传统单掩码分割场景中的良好性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces

1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEST竞赛旨在推动历史手写文档的少样本文本行分割方法开发，参赛者只需使用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，以解决标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临独特挑战：笔迹不规则、墨水褪色、复杂布局和重叠行。标注数据稀缺使全监督学习方法不实用，需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 举办FEST竞赛，使用U-DIADS-TL数据集，要求参与者仅用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，开发能够处理多样化布局、退化程度和非标准格式的文本行分割系统。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多种古代手稿，具有广泛的布局变化、退化程度和非标准格式，能够真实反映实际应用场景。

Conclusion: 通过强调少样本学习，FEST竞赛旨在促进开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，使人文学者只需最少量的人工标注即可使用自动化文档分析工具，从而推动历史研究中自动化工具的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: 评估蛋白质表面形状检索方法在大型数据集上的性能，探索静电势等分子表面描述符对检索效果的影响。

Method: 使用包含11,555个蛋白质表面的数据集，计算静电势作为关键分子表面描述符，通过准确率、平衡准确率、F1分数、精确率和召回率等指标评估15种检索方法。

Result: 结合静电势与分子表面形状的方法取得了最佳检索性能，即使在数据有限的类别中也表现良好，证明了额外分子表面描述符的重要性。

Conclusion: 静电势作为分子表面描述符的补充能够显著提升蛋白质表面形状检索性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，强调了多描述符融合的重要性。

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动解决频谱瓶颈问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时会出现频谱瓶颈现象，无法有效拟合目标信号，特别是当网络频率支持与目标频谱不匹配时。

Method: WINNER方法在均匀初始化的SIREN权重上添加高斯噪声，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，无需引入额外可训练参数。

Result: 该方法在音频拟合任务中达到state-of-the-art性能，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升。

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络的自适应、目标感知初始化策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Result: 综述了全向视觉领域的最新突破性进展，提出了理想的系统架构和未来研究方向

Conclusion: 全向视觉在具身AI时代具有重要价值，需要跨社区合作解决开放挑战，构建鲁棒的通用全向AI系统

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务上显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%，主要得益于VFM在预训练中学习到的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像专用检测器在精心设计的基准测试中表现良好，但在真实世界场景中失败率极高，需要寻找更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，在其上训练简单的线性分类器来检测AI生成的图像，并通过文本-图像相似性分析探究VFM的能力来源。

Result: VFM-based方法在真实世界基准测试中比专用检测器准确率提升超过20%，研究发现这种优势来源于VFM在预训练中对伪造相关概念的文本-图像对齐学习。

Conclusion: 1) 更新的VFM原始"火力"比静态检测器的"工艺"更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Result: 系统能耗比边缘GPU参考方案低几个数量级，可电池供电运行超过一年；模型主要依赖无人机形状而非螺旋桨时间特征；合成数据可用于训练

Conclusion: 小型低功耗设计便于在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点部署，提供高效的无人机检测解决方案

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dream3DAvatar是一个高效、文本可控的两阶段框架，用于从单张图像生成3D虚拟人。通过多视角生成和3D高斯溅射重建，解决了单目输入信息不足的问题，实现了对遮挡区域几何和纹理的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单图像3D虚拟人重建方法由于单目输入信息有限，难以控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理，存在根本性的不适定性问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视角生成模型（包含Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型进行3D高斯溅射重建（包含ID-Adapter-R）。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成逼真、可直接动画的3D虚拟人，无需后处理，在多个评估指标上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的两阶段设计和适配器机制，有效解决了单图像3D虚拟人生成中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段强化学习框架PeBR-R1，专门针对视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力进行联合增强，解决了直接从LLMs移植RL方法到VLMs的次优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法主要针对LLMs设计，直接应用到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs需要先准确感知和理解视觉输入才能进行有效推理。VLMs面临的任务更加复杂，需要专门的训练框架。

Method: 采用两阶段RL框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升模型视觉感知能力；第二阶段专注于增强推理能力。使用数据集级采样来缓解RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了VLMs的性能，PeBR-R1模型在各种视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功解决了VLMs训练中的特殊挑战，显著增强了模型的感知和推理能力，为视觉语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: HERO是一个无需训练的高分辨率视觉语言模型高效推理框架，通过内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型(HR-LVLMs)通过将高分辨率图像裁剪为局部图块独立编码，虽然提升了细粒度视觉理解能力，但显著增加了视觉token数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 基于对HR-LVLMs中视觉token利用的实证研究，提出了HERO框架：1)估计图块重要性(视觉显著性和任务相关性)；2)利用CLIP编码器中CLS token的两阶段注意力模式；3)选择性保留具有互补作用的不同粒度视觉token。

Result: HERO在多种基准测试和模型规模下实现了优越的效率-精度权衡，所有操作都在无需训练的情况下完成。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过智能token选择在保持模型性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Conclusion: TFANet通过三阶段分层对齐框架有效解决了指代图像分割中的多模态错位和语义损失问题，特别是在复杂场景中表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用逐像素损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U形深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；在VGG提取的深度特征中嵌入KL散度增强感知损失。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和网络架构设计，有效解决了传统方法在傅里叶域信息拟合中的局限性，实现了优异的增强效果。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for

specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

TL;DR: 提出弱监督和自监督的类无关运动预测方法，利用前景/背景或非地面/地面掩码替代运动标注，显著减少标注成本，性能接近有监督方法


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要理解动态环境中的运动，但获取运动标注成本高昂。室外场景通常包含移动前景和静态背景，可将运动理解与场景解析关联

Method: 提出弱监督范式：用全标注或部分标注(1%, 0.1%)的前景/背景掩码替代运动标注；利用非地面/地面掩码进一步减少标注需求(0.01%)；设计自监督方法无需标注；提出鲁棒一致性感知Chamfer距离损失

Conclusion: 通过将运动预测与场景解析关联，提出的弱监督和自监督方法在显著减少标注需求的同时保持了良好的性能，为自动驾驶运动预测提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建大规模数据集和开发半监督方法有效解决了停车位检测中的数据稀缺和标注成本问题，为自动停车系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet通过多阶段蒸馏有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率中精度与效率的平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 提出的多视频协作框架通过结构化表示和知识融合，有效解决了视频推理中的时空不完整性问题，为视频语言模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Method: 使用真空成型样本的视觉数据构建数据集，采用图像增强技术改进模型训练，然后应用k最近邻算法将低质量部件映射到高质量对应部件，以确定需要调整的工艺参数。

Result: 模型在调整加热功率、加热时间和真空时间方面表现出色，能够有效减少缺陷并提高生产效率。

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出ResidualViT架构，通过可学习残差连接和token缩减模块，在保持精度的同时显著降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率下的时序密集推理，但计算帧级特征的计算成本很高，需要降低计算开销

Method: 引入ResidualViT架构，包含可学习残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token缩减模块选择性丢弃冗余信息并重用预训练基础模型权重；提出轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征

Result: 在4个任务5个数据集上验证，计算成本降低60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，同时保持与原始基础模型相近的精度

Conclusion: ResidualViT能有效降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本，在零样本和全监督设置下都表现出色，为高效视频处理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个核心游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时和可扩展的反馈机制，限制了培训效果和规模。

Method: 开发RadGame平台，包含两个核心模块：1) Localize模块 - 玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏解释；2) Report模块 - 玩家根据胸片撰写报告，基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化AI反馈，对比真实报告指出错误和遗漏。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上比传统被动方法提升68%（vs 17%），在报告撰写准确率上提升31%（vs 4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可靠的方法来量化AI生成图像的感知真实性，识别视觉不一致区域，这对于AI生成图像的实际应用和通过真实性反馈改进生成AI的光照真实感至关重要

Method: 使用在大规模数据集上训练的视觉语言模型生成视觉不一致的文本描述，作为人类标注的可靠替代，实现整体客观真实性评估和局部不一致识别

Result: 多模态方法提高了客观真实性预测性能，并生成有效的密集真实性映射图，能够区分真实和不真实的空间区域

Conclusion: 该框架为AI生成图像的实用性评估和生成AI的改进提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一种无需训练的方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用新颖的Style Disentangled Attention模块实现细粒度的纹理和几何风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn)模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高质量3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: StyleSculptor提供了一种有效的零样本方法，实现了细粒度的3D风格控制，为风格化3D资产生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D是一个连接单视图2D图像和多视图3D数据的视觉语言模型，通过共享视觉标记空间实现灵活的3D区域提示，无需多帧标注即可进行空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要处理2D图像，难以处理3D空间关系。需要一种能够统一2D和3D表示空间的方法，支持灵活的3D区域标注和空间推理。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，构建共享视觉标记空间。支持边界框、分割掩码或直接3D标注，利用2D先验进行跨帧空间推理。

Result: 在2D视觉语言和3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够准确推断空间关系和度量测量，即使在无3D输入或标注的野外视频中也适用。

Conclusion: SR-3D成功统一了2D和3D表示空间，为场景理解提供了有效的解决方案，展示了在真实世界应用中的潜力。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足，通常只占已发布资源的一小部分，需要专门资源来支持荷兰语嵌入模型的开发和评估。

Method: 1) 创建MTEB-NL荷兰语基准测试，包含现有和新建数据集；2) 编译荷兰语检索数据集并利用大语言模型生成合成数据；3) 开发紧凑高效的E5-NL嵌入模型系列。

Result: 提供了完整的荷兰语嵌入评估和生成资源，包括基准测试、训练数据集和性能良好的嵌入模型，所有资源通过Hugging Face Hub和MTEB包公开可用。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了荷兰语嵌入资源的空白，为荷兰语NLP社区提供了重要的基础设施，有望推动荷兰语嵌入技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事构建的道德推理基准测试，用于评估LLM的深层理解能力，发现大型模型虽然表现更好但容易受到对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上表现出色，需要评估它们在复杂抽象推理和推断方面的能力，特别是道德推理等深层理解技能。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，设计多选题测试道德推理，并创建对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但容易受到对抗性操纵，约20%的情况下会自相矛盾，推理增强模型未能弥合性能差距。

Conclusion: 规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动力，当前LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，主要依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统评估指标无法捕捉法学等专业领域中推荐系统的细微质量差异，需要研究LLM是否能够可靠地评估同类系统。

Method: 通过系统性实验，研究不同评估者间可靠性指标的有效性，比较传统指标与Gwet's AC2、秩相关系数在法学RAG系统评估中的表现，并使用Wilcoxon符号秩检验进行统计验证。

Result: 发现传统指标如Krippendorff's alpha在AI系统评估的偏态分布中会产生误导，而Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数是更稳健的评估指标选择。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的自动化评估框架，能够在保持法学应用所需精度的同时，解决传统人工密集型评估的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

Conclusion: SENTRA是一个通用的分类器，能有效检测LLM生成的文本，特别是在跨域场景中表现优异

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the

the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as

SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in

Conclusion: 这是医疗领域首个全面的多语言NLG评估定性研究，强调了需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开以支持未来研究

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

Result: 评估20个领先LLMs显示，模型虽然能判断文本是否包含错误，但精确定位错误仍具挑战性，顶级模型性能仍不及人类专家，且发现过度批评现象。

Conclusion: MedFact为开发更可靠和医学感知的模型提供了强大资源，突显了在医疗应用中部署LLMs的关键挑战，特别是错误定位和过度批评问题。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率检索演示样本，导致选择不相关或冗余的示例，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计测试输入所需的主题知识；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入模型知识盲区且未被覆盖的必需主题的演示样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上的广泛实验验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的方法显著提升了上下文学习中演示样本选择的质量，能够更全面地满足测试输入的知识需求。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 随着语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，需要确保它们与人类语言理解的一致性，特别是在联合国可持续发展目标4的背景下，语言清晰度至关重要

Method: 创建LUCID数据集（包含英语和孟加拉语的精心设计的句子对），使用标准指标（Pearson相关、Spearman相关、MAE）和新颖的HCE准确率指标评估多个SOTA模型

Result: Compound-Beta表现最均衡，在英语中取得最高Pearson相关，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，表明在跨语言场景中与人类判断高度一致

Conclusion: 语言模型在精细语言理解方面仍需改进，Compound-Beta在跨语言对齐方面表现最佳，为教育技术中的LM部署提供了重要参考

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过提炼大语言模型的推理轨迹来训练任务专用的小型推理模型，在数据稀缺领域提供了一种实用且成本效益高的LLM适应方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺的情况下，训练任务专用的小型推理模型具有挑战性。但具备推理能力的大语言模型产生了丰富的中间推理轨迹，可以系统性地提炼为有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 使用开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高质量数据集；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，校准模型的中间推理。

Result: 在数据库系统设计的扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务中，R2tA方法有效处理了结构复杂的任务，而仅靠提示的方法会遗漏或产生错误。使用包含600个EERD变体（11个错误类别）的数据集进行实证评估。

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的可扩展LLM适应提供了实用且成本效益高的路径，为教育等领域实现了可复现的AI工具。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

TL;DR: FunAudio-ASR是一个基于大语言模型的大规模语音识别系统，通过数据扩展、模型扩展、LLM集成和强化学习的协同组合，在多样化复杂场景中实现最先进性能，并针对实际部署进行了专门优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的ASR系统容易产生幻觉问题，严重影响实际应用中的用户体验，需要开发一个既能保持LLM优势又能解决实际部署问题的ASR系统。

Method: 结合海量数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，专门针对流式处理、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行优化。

Result: 在真实工业评估集上实现SOTA性能，相比其他LLM-based ASR系统在开源基准上表现优异但在实际应用中表现不佳的情况，FunAudio-ASR展现了在实际环境中的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FunAudio-ASR通过生产导向的优化，成功解决了LLM-based ASR系统在实际部署中的幻觉问题，为实际应用提供了高性能且鲁棒的语音识别解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

TL;DR: 比较三种基于Transformer的神经机器翻译管道在班巴拉语（Bambara）翻译任务上的性能，包括简单Transformer、LLaMA3微调和语言蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 班巴拉语是一种非洲曼德语系语言，使用者约1418万人，但缺乏高质量的机器翻译资源。本研究旨在探索不同神经网络架构在低资源语言翻译中的效果。

Method: 1. 简单Transformer直接训练法语到班巴拉语翻译；2. 微调LLaMA3（3B-8B）指导模型；3. 使用语言蒸馏技术将班巴拉语集成到预训练的LaBSE模型中，再通过BERT扩展生成翻译。

Result: 简单Transformer管道在Bayelemagaba数据集上获得最佳翻译准确率（10% BLEU，21% chrF），在Yiri数据集上达到33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。指导模型在单一数据集上表现更好，表明它们能更有效地捕捉数据集特定模式。

Conclusion: 对于班巴拉语这样的低资源语言，简单的Transformer架构在机器翻译任务上表现最佳，而大型指导模型更适合单一数据集而非聚合数据集。

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 提出零样本自动音频字幕生成系统，利用预训练音频CLIP模型提取特征并生成结构化提示，指导大语言模型生成字幕，相比传统方法在NLG评分上提升35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动音频字幕生成面临数据集有限的问题，传统方法需要大量训练数据，需要开发不依赖大规模训练数据的解决方案

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征并生成结构化提示，通过MAGIC搜索优化token选择，确保生成内容与音频对齐

Result: 实验结果显示NLG平均分数从4.7提升到7.3，提升35%，性能严重依赖音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择，使用单关键词提示效果最佳

Conclusion: 零样本方法有效解决了音频字幕生成的数据限制问题，预训练模型结合结构化提示的方法显著提升了生成质量

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样化并行强化学习，显著降低自动定理证明的计算成本，仅用12%的计算成本就能达到基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在自动定理证明中采用测试时扩展策略（如反射式CoT推理和增加采样次数）带来了显著的计算开销，且现有成本分析忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样化并行强化学习与可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提高通过率。这些方法可集成到统一的EconRL流程中。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验表明，EconProver仅用12%的计算成本就达到了基线方法的可比性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级自动定理证明模型而不牺牲性能提供了可行的见解，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

TL;DR: RoPE存在距离依赖偏差限制长上下文建模能力，本文提出TAPA方法通过可学习相位函数改进位置编码，在长上下文任务上表现优于RoPE系列方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) 存在内在的距离依赖偏差，限制了其建模长上下文的能力，而现有的扩展方法通常需要预训练后的调整

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中引入可学习相位函数的位置编码方法

Result: TAPA能够保持长距离的token交互，通过轻量微调扩展到更长上下文，外推到未见长度，在长上下文任务上获得显著更低的困惑度

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的长上下文位置编码解决方案，相比RoPE系列方法具有更好的性能和扩展性

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

TL;DR: 提出Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC)框架，通过发音感知的上下文学习解决LLM-based ASR中的发音建模和同音词区分问题，显著降低词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中发音建模效果不佳和同音词区分能力弱的问题，特别是对生僻词和长尾词的识别挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1）发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错的字素-音素上下文建模策略；2）发音判别性强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强同音词区分能力。

Result: 在英文Librispeech和中文AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-based ASR模型，相对词错误率分别降低30.2%和53.8%；长尾词的偏置词错误率相对降低31.8%和60.5%。

Conclusion: PAC框架有效提升了ASR系统的发音建模和同音词区分能力，特别是在处理生僻词和长尾词方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种检测大型语言模型意识形态偏向的方法，通过分析模型输出在相关主题提示下的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控，适用于黑盒系统的独立审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数百万用户产品中的广泛应用，其输出可能影响个人信念和公众舆论。如果模型可以被有意引导到特定意识形态立场，控制这些系统的实体可能对公共话语产生不成比例的影响。需要开发方法来检测这种操控尝试。

Method: 采用先前提出的统计方法，适应于意识形态偏向审计的新情境。该方法具有模型无关性，不需要访问语言模型内部结构，而是通过分析模型在选定主题相关提示下输出的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其实际适用性和支持对大语言模型行为进行独立事后审计的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型意识形态操控提供了一个实用的工具，特别适合对专有黑盒系统进行审计，有助于确保语言模型的公正性和透明度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

Motivation: 情感支持对话中大型语言模型存在策略规划准确性低和严重偏好偏差的问题，现有方法虽然通过微调策略规划器显示了一定潜力，但对LLM偏好偏差的根本原因缺乏深入研究。

Method: 首先揭示LLM策略规划中知识边界的根本原因，然后提出基于强化学习的双重奖励函数方法，通过准确性和基于熵的置信度来优化不同知识边界区域的策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的多个LLM骨干网络实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过识别知识边界并设计双重奖励函数的强化学习方法，能够有效缓解LLM在情感支持对话中的策略规划偏好偏差问题，提升对话质量。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的在线内容激增，传统基于人类文本训练的毒性分类器面临误分类问题，现有防御策略被动且效果有限，需要主动识别和修复模型脆弱性。

Method: 使用微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，通过对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，然后抑制这些脆弱电路来提升模型性能，并在多个少数群体数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或易受攻击的特定注意力头，抑制脆弱头能显著提升对抗输入的性能，不同人口群体的脆弱性由不同注意力头负责。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能提高毒性检测模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，还能为开发更具包容性的模型提供人口层面的洞察，促进更公平的模型训练。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

Motivation: MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以准确捕捉域外知识或信息，需要解决这一问题

Method: 提出基于案例的决策理论(CBDT)解码，使用领域数据示例来估计期望效用，结合MBR和CBDT解码

Result: 在7个德英和日英互译任务以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像描述任务中，MBR+CBDT组合方法优于MBR解码

Conclusion: CBDT解码不仅能生成比MAP解码更高质量的文本，与MBR结合后还能进一步提升性能，特别是在处理域外知识方面

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Motivation: 现有时间推理数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且更关注当代事件，需要构建一个全面的多语言历史事件数据库和基准测试来评估LLM的时间推理能力。

Method: 从Wikipedia时间线页面和文章信息框中提取历史事件构建多语言数据库，创建包含6种时间QA推理任务的基准测试，并评估LLaMA-3-8B、Mistral-7B、Gemma-2-9b、Qwen3-8B、GPT4o等流行语言模型。

Conclusion: HistoryBank为推进多语言和时间感知的历史事件自然语言理解提供了全面资源，代码和数据集将在论文接受后公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

Result: 实验表明，这种训练方法使CLEAR GLASS模型在抽象概念识别方面相比最先进模型有所提升，概念抽象能力作为涌现能力出现。

Conclusion: 提出的分组对比损失方法和训练策略能够有效提升视觉语言模型的概念抽象能力，使模型能够更好地理解和表示高层次概念信息。

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

Motivation: 现有'自上而下'方法在生成假设或大纲后再检索证据，容易导致模型计划与可用知识脱节，产生内容碎片化和事实不准确的问题。

Method: 采用'检索优先获取知识，聚类构建结构'策略，首先从知识库进行详尽迭代检索，然后使用无监督聚类算法将检索到的文档组织成不同的'知识簇'，以此为基础生成层次化大纲和最终文档内容。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成可靠、结构化长文档提供了有效范式，为高风险、知识密集型领域中的LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Motivation: 马耳他语作为受罗曼语和日耳曼语影响的独特闪族语言，与阿拉伯语等近亲存在文字系统差异，研究如何利用阿拉伯语资源来弥补马耳他语NLP资源不足的问题。

Method: 采用多种策略对齐阿拉伯语文本数据与马耳他语，包括不同音译方案和机器翻译方法，并引入了新的能更好表示马耳他语正字法的音译系统。

Result: 阿拉伯语基础的增强技术能显著有益于马耳他语NLP任务，在单语和多语模型上都取得了积极效果。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语资源可以有效支持马耳他语NLP，跨语言增强技术为解决低资源语言处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 多媒体内容的激增需要有效的多媒体事件抽取系统，但大型视觉语言模型在此任务中的应用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 在M2E2数据集上系统评估代表性LVLMs（DeepSeek-VL2和Qwen-VL系列），涵盖纯文本、纯图像和跨媒体子任务，采用few-shot提示和微调两种设置。

Result: few-shot LVLMs在视觉任务表现良好但文本任务困难；LoRA微调显著提升性能；多模态组合展现强协同效应，在跨模态设置中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LVLMs在M2E2任务中展现出潜力，但在语义精度、定位和跨模态基础等关键挑战领域仍存在持续困难，需要进一步研究来推进M2E2能力发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM难度估计方法依赖重复采样、辅助模型或微调，计算成本高且可能影响通用性，需要更高效准确的估计方法

Method: 将token级生成过程建模为马尔可夫链，定义价值函数来估计给定隐藏状态的预期输出质量，仅基于初始隐藏状态进行难度估计

Result: 在文本和多模态任务上的实验表明，该方法在难度估计方面持续优于现有基线，自适应推理策略使用更少的生成token实现更高推理效率

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效且通用的LLM难度估计解决方案，为自适应推理和性能评估提供了有力工具

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Conclusion: 通过从零开始训练、软掩码机制和动态硬负样本挖掘，Conan-embedding-v2成功解决了LLMs与嵌入模型之间的训练差距问题，在文本嵌入任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large

tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Motivation: 研究ReLoRA方法在小型语言模型预训练中的效果，探索参数高效方法在低计算成本环境下的适用性。

Method: 通过消融实验系统评估ReLoRA在11M-66M参数SLMs上的性能表现和学习动态，使用损失值、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标。

Result: ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP等指标上普遍表现不如标准训练，且模型越大性能差距越明显；分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型的秩缺陷问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能难以直接迁移到小型语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算资源环境下进行更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

Conclusion: SitLLM框架通过多模态融合和LLM集成，有效解决了现有坐姿监测系统的局限性，为个性化健康管理提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across

by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our

*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD是一种基于隐藏信号分析的幻觉检测框架，通过建模自回归生成过程中隐藏表示的时间动态，在频域分析中提取最强非直流频率分量作为特征，在多个基准测试中比现有方法提升10个百分点以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，导致检测效果和鲁棒性有限。

Method: HSAD框架通过采样各层激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用LLMs的自回归特性确定最佳观测点。

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比现有最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

### [146] [The Few-shot Dilemma: Over-prompting Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13196)
*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现过度提示现象——在提示中添加过多示例反而会降低大语言模型性能，挑战了传统少样本学习的认知。通过多种少样本选择方法和多个LLM的实验，确定了最优示例数量，在软件需求分类任务上超越现有最佳方法1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究过度提示现象，即过多的上下文示例反而会降低LLM性能，这与传统认为更多相关示例总是有益的认知相矛盾，特别是在软件工程和需求分析领域具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了一个提示框架，使用三种少样本选择方法（随机采样、语义嵌入、TF-IDF向量），在多个LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-3.5-turbo、DeepSeek-V3等）上进行评估，通过逐渐增加TF-IDF选择和分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量。

Result: 实验发现过度添加领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，确定了每个LLM的最优示例数量，在功能和非功能需求分类任务上比现有最佳方法提升1%的性能。

Conclusion: 过度提示确实存在，需要谨慎选择少样本示例数量，结合TF-IDF和分层选择的方法可以用更少示例获得更好性能，避免了过度提示问题。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Julina Maharjan,Xinyu Li,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在人格特质评估方面表现有限，所有模型预测与真实人格特质的相关性均低于0.26，表明当前LLM与验证心理学构念的对齐度不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在需要心理理解的角色中部署增加，如情感支持代理和决策助手，但其在生态有效对话环境中解释人类人格特质的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用包含半结构化访谈记录和验证连续大五人格特质分数的新基准数据集，系统评估三种范式：零样本和思维链提示、LoRA微调、以及使用预训练嵌入的回归分析。

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质的Pearson相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提示提升有限，表明人格推断更多依赖于潜在语义表征而非显式推理。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将LLM与复杂人类属性对齐的挑战，并推动未来在特质特定提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向微调方面的工作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartGaze是一个新的眼动追踪数据集，通过比较人类和模型注意力模式，发现LVLMs在图表问答任务中注意力与人类存在差异，提出了基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，显著提升了模型准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表是重要的信息可视化媒介，但现有大型视觉语言模型在图表问答任务中经常关注不相关区域，导致性能受限。研究旨在通过人类注视模式来改善模型的注意力和推理能力。

Method: 构建ChartGaze眼动追踪数据集，捕获人类在图表推理任务中的注视模式；提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，将图像-文本注意力与人类注视点对齐。

Result: 方法在多个模型上实现了最高2.56个百分点的准确率提升，同时显著改善了注意力对齐效果。

Conclusion: 人类注视信息可以有效提升图表相关LVLMs的推理质量和可解释性，展示了将人类认知模式融入模型优化的潜力。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理在自主发现和合成外部知识时面临上下文窒息和噪声污染的问题，需要一种新的框架来克服这些限制并提升工具使用能力。

Method: 提出WebResearcher迭代深度研究范式（将深度研究建模为马尔可夫决策过程）和WebFrontier数据合成引擎（通过工具增强的复杂性升级生成高质量训练数据），支持并行思维和多智能体并发探索。

Result: 在6个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，甚至超越了前沿专有系统，训练数据显著提升了传统单上下文方法的工具使用能力。

Conclusion: WebResearcher框架通过创新的迭代研究范式和数据合成方法，有效解决了深度研究中的关键挑战，为构建更强大的自主知识发现AI代理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

Motivation: 现有基于通用基础模型的训练方法在智能体任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏强大的智能体基础模型，导致模型需要同时学习多样智能体行为并与专家演示对齐，造成优化冲突

Method: 提出Agentic Continual Pre-training方法，将其整合到深度研究智能体训练流程中，构建智能体基础模型AgentFounder

Result: AgentFounder-30B在10个基准测试中达到最先进性能：BrowseComp-en 39.9%、BrowseComp-zh 43.3%、HLE Pass@1 31.5%，同时保持强大的工具使用能力

Conclusion: Agentic CPT方法有效解决了智能体基础模型缺失的问题，为构建高性能智能体系统提供了新的训练范式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界API需要精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，而代理能力的广度与训练环境的多样性密切相关。为了解决环境扩展和有效训练的核心挑战，需要系统性地扩展环境规模。

Method: 设计了一个可扩展框架，自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，系统性地拓宽函数调用场景空间。采用两阶段代理微调策略：首先赋予基础代理能力，然后针对特定领域进行专业化。

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等代理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，训练出的AgentScaler模型显著增强了模型的函数调用能力。

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境构建和两阶段训练策略，成功提升了大型语言模型在函数调用方面的代理智能，为实际应用部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法存在静态研究流程（规划与证据获取分离）和一次性生成范式（容易遭受长文本失败问题如"中间丢失"和幻觉）的双重限制

Method: 引入双智能体框架：规划器动态循环迭代地交织证据获取和提纲优化，生成全面的基于来源的提纲；写作者执行分层检索和写作过程，逐节撰写报告

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 验证了以人为中心的迭代方法学，证明自适应规划和聚焦式合成对于生成高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的网络代理在知识密集型任务上表现优异，但受到上下文窗口限制，复杂查询需要大量搜索循环，容易耗尽上下文预算而无法完成完整解决方案

Method: 引入ReSum范式，通过定期上下文摘要将增长的交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态；提出ReSum-GRPO，整合GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播，使代理适应基于摘要的推理

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum平均比ReAct绝对提升4.5%，经过ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升达8.2%；WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要有效解决了LLM网络代理的上下文限制问题，ReSum-GRPO训练进一步提升了性能，在少量训练样本下就能超越现有开源网络代理

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

TL;DR: 该研究批判性评估了LLM激活解释方法，发现现有基准测试存在问题，解释结果往往反映了解释器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的真实激活模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活解释方法是否能真正揭示目标LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅仅反映了输入信息或解释器LLM的偏见。

Method: 在先前工作使用的数据集上评估流行解释方法，进行控制实验分析解释结果的信息来源。

Result: 解释方法在无需访问目标模型内部的情况下也能在基准测试中成功，解释结果主要反映了解释器LLM的参数知识。

Conclusion: 需要更有针对性的基准测试和实验控制来严格评估解释方法是否真正提供了对LLM操作的有意义洞察。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但公开测试案例稀缺，需要能够联合合成电网结构和节点动态的生成工具，同时保持物理可行性和避免过高计算成本。

Method: 采用依赖分解方法，将复杂联合分布分解为可行电网拓扑、时间序列总线负载等条件分布链；使用分层图beta扩散过程进行结构合成，配合时间自编码器将时间序列数据嵌入紧凑潜在空间。

Result: 在基准测试中，PowerGrow不仅在前扩散模型的保真度和多样性方面表现更优，还实现了98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1事故恢复能力。

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成运行有效且现实的电网场景，为解决电力系统测试案例稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Motivation: 尽管去中心化学习在理论上得到广泛探索，但由于缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，尚未在生产环境中广泛应用。本研究旨在探索去中心化数据并行训练在大规模DNN训练中的实际应用潜力。

Method: 引入DBench基准测试框架，比较中心化和去中心化DNN训练；通过改变通信图和训练规模，分析模型精度与参数张量方差的相关性；提出Ada方法，在去中心化SGD训练中动态调整通信图。

Result: 发现去中心化训练存在可扩展性和通用性问题；模型精度与通信图连接数相关；对参数张量方差异常敏感；Ada方法在1008个GPU上训练ResNet50时，收敛率和模型精度均达到或接近中心化学习水平。

Conclusion: 去中心化学习在大规模DNN训练中具有实际应用价值，通过自适应通信图调整的Ada方法能够有效解决可扩展性和精度问题，为生产环境部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM安全对齐机制会同时拒绝恶意请求和合法的高风险场景使用（如警务、国防），现有单一向量编辑方法缺乏语义控制，会无差别解锁所有危险主题。

Method: 提出相互排斥解锁向量(MEUV)框架，通过多任务目标学习主题对齐的正交向量，包含差分消融边际、跨主题惩罚、正交性惩罚等辅助项，单epoch训练完成。

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，MEUV在多个模型上达到不低于87%的攻击成功率，同时将跨主题泄漏减少高达90%，中英文向量可近乎无损跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: MEUV证明了细粒度主题级能力激活的可行性，为安全敏感领域的可控LLM部署铺平了道路，且具有语言无关的拒绝子空间特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模低轨卫星系统能够实现广域数据交换，但由于隐私和监管限制，原始数据无法集中聚合。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护方案，但卫星网络的动态拓扑和有限带宽会阻碍参数聚合，导致训练时间延长

Method: 使用离散时间图建模的按需调度框架，动态分配通信资源来加速联邦学习过程

Result: 仿真结果显示，相比传统统计复用策略，该方法减少整体轮次时间14.20%至41.48%，且模型越大、客户端越多，加速效果越明显

Conclusion: 所提出的调度框架具有良好可扩展性，能够有效解决卫星网络中联邦学习的通信瓶颈问题

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

*Parsa Vatani,Mohamed Elrefaie,Farhad Nazarpour,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TripOptimizer是一个基于深度学习的可微分框架，直接从点云数据实现快速气动分析和形状优化，通过变分自编码器和三平面隐式神经表示实现高保真3D几何重建和阻力系数预测，在DrivAerNet++数据集上训练，优化后设计可降低阻力系数达11.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算流体动力学(CFD)的气动形状优化计算成本高昂，严重限制了设计空间探索，需要开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)结合三平面隐式神经表示进行高保真3D几何重建，添加阻力系数预测头，在包含8000个车辆几何和对应阻力系数的大规模数据集DrivAerNet++上训练，通过修改编码器参数子集实现形状优化。

Result: 优化设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低，结果通过独立的高保真CFD模拟（超过1.5亿个网格单元）验证，隐式表示对几何缺陷具有鲁棒性，能够优化非水密网格。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的气动形状优化工作流程，减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，特别是在早期设计阶段，为传统伴随方法难以处理的非水密网格优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法在不同设置下的有效性

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Motivation: 解决心理治疗领域结构化评估和非结构化临床笔记共存、数据缺失和结果相关性等数据异质性问题，需要个性化的信息处理方法来提高预测精度

Method: 基于路由的架构，定义多种模态路径（原始和融合的文本与数值特征表示），学习为每个输入选择最信息丰富的专家组合，任务特定预测由共享或独立头部根据路由决策产生，端到端训练

Conclusion: 该框架通过实现考虑数据异质性和任务相关性的个性化信息处理，解决了个性化医疗中的关键挑战，在心理治疗应用中可改善心理健康结果、提高治疗分配精度和临床成本效益

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

Conclusion: 这是首个在消费级GPU上系统研究LLM微调效率的案例研究，为资源受限的研究者和实践者提供了可复现的基准测试和实用指南

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病进展预测需要整合多模态神经影像数据，但现有多模态模型在推理时遇到模态缺失（临床常见情况）时预测准确性下降。

Method: 提出PerM-MoE方法，使用独立路由器替代传统的单一路由器，为每个模态分配专门的路由器，提高模型在模态缺失情况下的灵活性。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上评估显示，PerM-MoE在大多数模态缺失变化情况下优于最先进的Flex-MoE和单模态模型，能更有效地利用专家网络。

Conclusion: PerM-MoE通过独立路由器设计显著提升了多模态模型在临床常见模态缺失场景下的预测性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL两阶段微调范式中性能提升的机制，挑战"SFT记忆、RL泛化"的简化观点，深入研究OOD性能变化的内在原因。

Method: 使用SVD分析参数矩阵，手动编辑参数并观察性能影响，分析不同训练阶段奇异值和奇异向量的变化。

Result: 发现OOD性能在SFT早期达到峰值后下降；RL主要恢复SFT丢失的OOD能力而非创造新能力；恢复能力受SFT训练时长限制；奇异向量旋转而非奇异值变化是OOD行为的关键机制。

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT和RL在两阶段微调中的角色，发现奇异向量旋转是性能变化的核心机制，为理解微调过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微分同胚嵌入神经算子的新框架NDNO，用于高效预测不同几何结构零件在残余应力作用下的加工变形，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高和神经算子直接应用于变化几何域的理论限制问题。

Motivation: 结构零件加工变形的准确预测对保证尺寸精度和可靠性至关重要。传统数值方法在建模残余应力与变形耦合时计算成本高昂，特别是对于多样化几何形状。神经算子虽能高效求解偏微分方程，但直接应用于变化几何域存在理论和实践限制。

Method: 提出神经微分同胚-神经算子(NDNO)框架：首先通过受平滑性和可逆性约束的微分同胚神经网络将复杂三维几何显式映射到共同参考域，然后在参考域上训练神经算子学习残余应力引起的变形场。训练完成后，两个网络都能高效预测，快速适应不同几何形状。

Result: 该方法能够准确预测主方向和多方向变形场，在不同几何形状（包括组件类型、尺寸和特征）的零件上实现了高精度和高效率。

Conclusion: NDNO框架为不同几何形状结构零件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，克服了传统方法和直接应用神经算子的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Motivation: 滤泡性甲状腺癌缺乏特异性超声征象，术前诊断困难，相关临床研究较少，需要开发新的数据分析方法来识别有助于术前诊断的临床指标

Method: 采用改进的关联规则挖掘方法，结合可解释机器学习SHAP方法思想，提出新的分析指标来反映临床指标与癌症之间的恶性关联

Result: 分析1673个病例节点，发现除常见指标外，结节内结节模式、小梁模式、低TSH评分等指标具有强恶性关联，Hashimoto甲状腺炎组合也有强关联

Conclusion: 滤泡性甲状腺癌术前诊断应考虑多个临床指标，本研究发现的多样化恶性关联可为临床医生提供参考

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising

Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) 在视觉表示学习和基于模型的强化学习中应用日益广泛，但其行为机制仍缺乏深入理解。本文旨在从理论角度分析JEPA变体的表示学习特性。

Method: 提出一个简单的实用JEPA变体，包含与潜在动态联合训练的辅助回归头。在确定性MDP框架下进行理论分析，证明"无病态表示坍塌定理"，并通过计数环境中的受控消融实验验证理论。

Result: 理论证明显示，当两个损失函数都趋近于零时，非等价观测（具有不同转移动态或辅助标签）必然映射到不同的潜在表示。实验结果表明，联合训练JEPA模型和辅助头比分开训练能产生更丰富的表示。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过选择适当的辅助函数与转移动态相结合，可以指导JEPA编码器学习正确的等价关系，这为提高JEPA编码器性能指明了方向。

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial
Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently
complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional
models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing,
offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with
quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for
stock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock
market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data
closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction
accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The
quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research
represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial
forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over
traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,
financial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.

Conclusion: C3DE通过结合神经控制微分方程和因果感知机制，有效解决了长期城市人流预测中的累积误差和多时间尺度异步动态问题，为城市智能交通管理提供了有效工具

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习为下游处理准备输入数据，以及研究KA几何结构的出现机制以通过及时调整超参数来加速学习。

Method: 通过分析Jacobian矩阵J(x)的外部幂的统计特性，包括零行数量和次要统计量，来量化和表征KA几何结构。

Result: 发现KA几何结构经常在训练普通单隐藏层神经网络时产生，并对其在函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中的出现位置有了初步理解。

Conclusion: 这项研究是KA-Networks（KANs）的"另一面"，不是将KA工程化到神经网络中，而是观察KA在浅层MLP中的自然涌现。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入能有效增强神经算子学习，为PDE代理建模提供了鲁棒且广泛适用的方法。

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA结合收缩正则化能有效提升有限训练样本下词嵌入在表格数据分类中的性能表现。

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph为表示学习和聚类提供了有效方法，可用于数据分析、异常检测和数据集优化，解决了原子数据集中的采样偏差问题。

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

TL;DR: 开发AI模型检测3D模型中可能导致打印失败的几何问题，帮助非专业用户在打印前识别潜在问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D打印技术正从专业用户向普通用户普及，但现有切片软件的检查功能有限，非专业用户难以识别可能导致打印失败的几何特征

Method: 训练AI模型来检测3D模型中常见的几何问题，特别是那些难以打印的几何形状

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ASGE（自适应空间优良性编码）框架，用于CNN的前向-前向算法训练，解决了通道维度爆炸问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，并首次成功应用于ImageNet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前向-前向算法扩展虽然改进了原始算法并适配了CNN，但存在表示能力有限、在大规模数据集上扩展性差的问题，主要原因是通道维度爆炸。

Method: ASGE利用特征图计算每层的空间感知优良性表示，实现逐层监督，关键是将分类复杂度与通道维度解耦。

Result: 在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100上分别达到99.65%、93.41%、90.62%、65.42%的准确率，在ImageNet上Top-1和Top-5准确率分别为26.21%和47.49%。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无BP CNN训练奠定了可行基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

TL;DR: 提出了贝叶斯参数矩阵模型(B-PMMs)，为科学机器学习中的谱方法提供不确定性量化，解决了传统确定性方法在安全关键应用中缺乏置信度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前谱学习方法仅提供点估计而无不确定性量化，限制了在安全关键应用中的使用。参数矩阵模型虽然性能优异但确定性本质限制了在不确定性量化应用中的部署。

Method: 引入贝叶斯参数矩阵模型框架，包括：(i)自适应谱分解与正则化矩阵扰动边界，(ii)使用流形感知矩阵变量高斯后验的结构化变分推断算法，(iii)具有谱间隙和问题条件显式依赖的有限样本校准保证。

Result: 在5x5到500x500矩阵维度上实验验证，B-PMMs实现了优异的不确定性校准(ECE < 0.05)，保持良好扩展性，在谱病态条件下表现优雅退化，在近退化状态下仍提供可靠不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该框架支持在不确定性关键领域进行稳健谱学习，为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出Surrogate Representation Inference (SRI)方法，通过神经网络学习低维表示来校正机器学习标注中的偏差，在中等预测精度下可将标准误差降低50%以上，并能处理人类标注中的非差分测量误差。

Motivation: 现有方法在机器学习模型和LLM标注非结构化数据时存在标准误差大且需要无误差人工标注的问题，需要开发更有效的偏差校正方法。

Method: 提出SRI方法，假设非结构化数据完全中介人类标注与结构化变量之间的关系，通过神经网络架构学习满足代理假设的低维表示，可校正人类标注中的非差分测量误差。

Result: 模拟研究和实际应用表明，当机器学习预测精度中等时，SRI可将标准误差降低50%以上，即使在人类标注存在非差分测量误差时也能提供有效推断。

Conclusion: SRI方法通过低维表示学习有效解决了机器学习标注中的偏差问题，显著提高了统计推断的准确性和效率。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

Conclusion: 所提出的参数化正则公平学习算法能够有效同时解决组合多臂老虎机中的三个关键目标，为无线网络等实际应用提供了理论保障和实用解决方案。

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Method: 使用非局部梯度替代局部梯度，探索了固定核和基于注意力的非局部算子公式，并通过数值研究验证新公式

Result: NNTK允许NTK理论扩展到非光滑函数、随机估计器和更广泛的模型家族，突破了传统可微性假设的限制

Conclusion: 非局部神经正切核框架为分析非光滑函数和更广泛模型类别的训练动力学提供了新的理论工具

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了边界元法(BEM)和物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在二维Helmholtz方程波散射问题中的性能，发现在相同精度下PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估时间快204倍，且PINNs在训练域外泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估BEM和PINNs在相同条件下解决Helmholtz方程波散射问题的性能，为波动传播问题的研究方法选择提供定量数据支持。

Method: 使用BEM进行边界离散化求解，同时通过超参数优化配置PINNs并最小化控制方程和边界条件的残差来训练神经网络，比较两种方法的精度、计算时间和泛化能力。

Result: 在相当精度下，PINNs训练时间比BEM长约42倍，但评估时间快204倍；PINNs在训练域外相对误差从7.46×10⁻²增加到8.22，而BEM在扩展区域保持相似误差水平。

Conclusion: PINNs在评估效率上有优势但训练成本高且泛化能力有限，BEM在计算稳定性和泛化性方面表现更好，研究为波动传播问题的数值方法选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

Motivation: 图结构多智能体系统在金融、机器人、能源和社会动力学等领域广泛存在，但现有方法在大规模稀疏设置下计算效率低下，需要一种既能保持性能又能减少计算负担的解决方案。

Method: 设计NTM架构，在图拓扑指导下对前馈神经网络进行稀疏化，嵌入固定的非可训练组件，并将其集成到Direct Parameterization和Deep BSDE两种游戏求解器中。

Result: 理论证明了NTM在静态图博弈中的通用逼近性质，数值实验表明NTM方法在三种随机微分博弈中达到与全可训练方法相当的性能，同时显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: NTM架构通过结合图结构先验知识，成功实现了在保持博弈求解性能的同时大幅减少计算复杂度，为大规模图结构多智能体系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益凸显。研究发现MLLMs的输出偏好可以被恶意图像操纵，产生具有偏见但难以检测的响应。

Method: 提出了Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，在推理时通过偏好劫持图像来操纵MLLM响应偏好，无需修改模型。还引入了通用劫持扰动，可嵌入不同图像中实现偏好劫持。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验结果表明该方法具有有效性，能够成功操纵MLLMs的输出偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs存在新的安全风险，攻击者可以通过优化图像来任意操纵模型输出偏好，这对MLLMs的安全部署提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

Motivation: 现有GNN在异质图（连接节点特征差异大）上表现不佳，甚至不如简单MLP。现有方法主要关注架构设计而未解决异质性的根本原因，需要创新方法来直接提高图同质性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Motivation: 解决传统Logit知识蒸馏方法决策过程可解释性有限的问题，同时保持其简单性和无需中间特征对齐的优点

Method: 利用解耦的局部logit表示的Gram矩阵，使学生模型能够学习潜在的语义结构模式，无需真实标签或特征空间对齐

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验显示iCD在不同师生架构中均有效，在细粒度分类任务中达到+5.08%的峰值提升

Conclusion: iCD是一种简单有效的可解释知识蒸馏方法，能够成功挖掘和传递结构知识，特别适用于细粒度分类任务

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形预测的训练免费、模型和专家无关的专家延迟框架，通过预测集识别标签特定不确定性，使用区分性标准选择最具有判别力的专家，在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上达到99%+准确率并显著减少专家工作量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习延迟方法对专家组成变化敏感且需要大量重新训练，需要一种无需重新训练、对模型和专家都无关的鲁棒延迟框架

Method: 使用共形预测生成预测集来识别标签特定不确定性，通过区分性标准（衡量专家区分剩余可能标签的能力）选择最具有判别力的专家

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上分别达到99.57±0.10%和99.40±0.52%的准确率，专家工作量减少高达11倍，在专家性能退化和低信息设置下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界人机协作提供了一个可扩展、无需重新训练的学习延迟替代方案

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了在模型访问受限和计算资源有限条件下训练数据归因(TDA)方法的可行性，提出了使用代理模型等解决方案，并证明即使模型未在目标数据集上训练，其归因分数仍然具有信息价值。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中基于数据集蒸馏的方法在空间域设计存在冗余信息和噪声的问题，这些冗余增加了通信负担

Method: 利用离散余弦变换的高能量集中特性，通过二进制掩码保留低频成分，过滤高频噪声，并结合真实数据驱动的分类损失来提升低频成分质量

Result: 在5个图像和语音数据集上优于现有方法，在CIFAR-10数据集上通信成本降低37.78%，性能提升10.88%

Conclusion: 频域感知的联邦学习方法FedFD能有效降低通信成本并提升模型性能，为联邦学习中的通信效率问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

TL;DR: TimeRep是一种新颖的时间序列异常检测方法，利用时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的中间层表示，通过距离计算异常分数，而非传统方法使用的最终层重建或预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖TSFMs最终层的表示来计算异常分数，但中间层可能包含更丰富的信息。TimeRep旨在利用中间层表示来提高异常检测性能。

Method: 1) 选择预训练TSFM中最具信息量的中间层和补丁标记位置 2) 从训练数据构建中间表示参考集 3) 使用核心集策略减少集大小但保持分布覆盖 4) 推理时通过距离计算异常分数 5) 集成适应机制处理概念漂移

Result: 在UCR异常档案库的250个单变量时间序列上进行广泛实验，TimeRep持续优于包括非深度学习、深度学习和基础模型方法在内的多种最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TimeRep通过利用TSFMs中间层表示和有效的核心集策略，在时间序列异常检测方面表现出卓越性能，并能有效处理概念漂移问题。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法来解决大语言模型评估中的不稳定性问题，通过为每个实例随机化所有影响因素并多次实验取平均，减少方差并增强模型比较的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估存在不稳定性，随机因素（如few-shot示例）的微小变化会导致评分剧烈波动甚至模型排名变化。不同模型对特定随机因素设置有不同偏好，固定设置可能导致不公平比较。

Method: 提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法：不再在整个基准测试中使用单一固定设置，而是为每个实例随机化所有影响评估得分的因素，进行多次实验并报告平均得分。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能够减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，同时以不到一半的计算成本达到与先前方法相似的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: ILR方法有效解决了LLM评估中的不稳定性问题，通过随机化每个实例的因素设置，显著提高了评估的公平性和可靠性，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 随着神经量子态(NQS)越来越多地采用基于大语言模型(LLM)的组件，作者希望理解NQS的缩放定律，从而揭示NQS ansatze的可扩展性和最优性能-资源权衡。

Method: 通过识别基于transformer的NQS在二次量子化量子化学应用中的缩放定律，测量绝对误差和V-score作为问题大小的函数，并进行计算约束优化分析。

Result: 研究发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量和ansatz选择，与语言模型中发现的近似线性关系不同。

Conclusion: NQS的缩放行为与语言模型存在显著差异，表明需要针对量子计算应用开发专门的缩放定律和优化策略。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CART决策树基于纯度分割缺乏统计理论基础，ZTree旨在提供统计严谨的替代方案，利用假设检验来识别有意义的子组差异，提高模型的统计可解释性。

Method: 在每个节点应用假设检验（z检验、t检验、Mann-Whitney U、log-rank等）评估候选子组与补集的差异，采用交叉验证方法处理多重检验问题，自动确定是否需要继续分割节点。

Result: 在五个大规模UCI数据集上的实证评估显示，ZTree在低数据量情况下表现优异，相比CART能生成更简洁的树而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ZTree提供了一个统计基础扎实、高效灵活的决策树框架，仅需一个p值阈值参数，使得参数调优直观高效，用户可以轻松集成各种统计检验方法。

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)，一种专为MIMO检测设计的软输入软输出神经网络架构，接近最大似然检测性能，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然检测计算复杂度太高，消息传递算法依赖大系统渐近性和随机矩阵假设，而现有Transformer检测器无法利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器软信息。

Method: 将消息传递直接集成到图感知注意力机制中，通过软输入嵌入支持解码器信息更新，实现有效的软输出生成。

Result: 作为独立检测器，SGT接近最大似然检测性能，并超越先前基于Transformer的方法。

Conclusion: SGT成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时实现了接近最优的检测性能。

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SDM激活函数，在标准softmax基础上增加了相似性和距离感知，提高了神经网络对协变量偏移和分布外输入的鲁棒性，并为选择性分类提供了更好的可解释性和可靠性保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax激活函数缺乏对相似性和距离训练分布的意识，限制了模型在协变量偏移和分布外输入情况下的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 在softmax激活函数中引入相似性感知（正确预测的深度匹配）和距离训练分布感知，结合原有的幅度感知，形成SDM激活函数。

Result: SDM激活函数比softmax对高概率区域的协变量偏移和分布外输入更鲁棒，通过密集匹配提供可解释性，并能对类别经验CDF进行分区以保障选择性分类中的类别召回率。

Conclusion: SDM激活函数在选择性分类中优于softmax，即使考虑后校准方法，因其提供了更好的鲁棒性、可解释性和可靠性保障。

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

Motivation: 联邦基础模型需要在小规模新用户或专业场景下进行微调，这些场景数据有限，个性化与联邦学习之间的权衡变得敏感，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：客户端使用私有数据进行个性化微调，服务器端使用基于客户端特定任务向量的相似用户进行个性化聚合，从而获得群体个性化信息并减少非IID数据的干扰。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验分析证明了所提出算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决联邦基础模型在小规模数据场景下的个性化微调问题，通过双层个性化机制平衡了个性化需求和联邦学习的优势。

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性肾病早期检测困难，特别是在门诊环境中缺乏实验室肾脏生物标志物，需要探索常规收集的非肾脏临床变量的预测潜力。

Method: 提出Nephrology-Oriented Representation leArning (NORA)方法，结合监督对比学习和非线性随机森林分类器，从表格EHR数据中提取判别性患者表征用于CKD分类。

Result: NORA提高了类别可分性和整体分类性能，特别是在早期CKD的F1分数方面有显著提升，并在不同患者队列中展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: NORA方法能够有效利用常规非肾脏临床变量进行慢性肾病风险分层，为门诊环境中的早期CKD检测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过反转s1k数据集构建r1k反向推理数据集，研究发现SFT在r1k上比s1k提升1.6%-6.8%准确率，但混合正反向数据会削弱方向区分性，DPO只能部分恢复区分性但会抑制次要推理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单向监督微调，忽视了不同推理模式之间的复杂相互作用，需要研究双向推理目标下SFT和DPO对对齐的影响。

Method: 构建r1k反向推理数据集（通过反转s1k的1000个正向样本），分别进行SFT和DPO实验，分析正反向数据混合对推理性能的影响。

Result: SFT在r1k上相比s1k获得1.6%-6.8%的准确率提升；混合正反向数据会削弱方向区分性；DPO能部分恢复区分性但会抑制次要推理路径。

Conclusion: 混合推理数据会引入冲突的监督信号，需要开发鲁棒且方向感知的对齐策略来处理双向推理任务。

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Result: 在三个图数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有正则化方法，在稳定性（保持旧知识）和可塑性（获取新知识）之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 所提出的在线曲率近似方法为图持续学习提供了一个有效的正则化框架，能够更好地捕捉损失景观，同时保留先前任务的知识

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字生态系统的发展使金融部门面临日益复杂的犯罪手段，传统基于规则的系统缺乏适应性，需要分析参与者互动来发现可疑活动和提取作案手法。

Method: 四步预处理框架：提取图结构、考虑时间性管理大节点集、社区检测、自动标注生成弱标签；然后实现三种不同的图自编码器变体进行模式识别。

Result: 初步结果表明，这种以模式为中心、拓扑驱动的方法能有效检测复杂金融犯罪方案，为传统基于规则的检测系统提供了有前景的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图机器学习和网络分析成功解决了金融数据稀疏无标签的挑战，为检测协调犯罪行为提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Motivation: 尽管基于投影的安全过滤器在安全关键强化学习中被广泛使用，但对其两种主要集成策略（SE-RL和SP-RL）的差异缺乏形式化理解，需要理论分析来指导方法选择和改进。

Method: 建立了actor-critic算法的统一形式化框架，理论分析了两种方法的策略梯度估计，重点研究了动作别名现象的影响，并比较了包括新颖惩罚方法在内的缓解策略。

Result: 实证结果表明动作别名对SP-RL的损害更大，但通过适当的改进策略，SP-RL可以在多种环境中匹配或超越改进后的SE-RL性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务特性选择和优化基于投影的安全RL方法提供了可操作的见解，SP-RL在适当改进后具有竞争优势。

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

TL;DR: TimeCluster是一种可视化分析技术，通过将多变量时间序列的滑动窗口投影到低维空间来发现结构。本文证明当使用PCA作为降维技术时，该方法在数学上等价于经典的线性子空间辨识方法。


<details>

Motivation: 探索TimeCluster可视化技术与传统子空间系统辨识方法之间的数学等价性，为时间序列分析提供新的理论联系和应用可能性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明：构建时间序列的滑动窗口矩阵形成Hankel矩阵，对其应用PCA（通过SVD）可以恢复与子空间辨识相同的特征方向。使用合成和真实动态信号进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证实TimeCluster的聚类坐标与子空间辨识方法完全一致，两种嵌入方法产生相同的结果。

Conclusion: TimeCluster与子空间辨识在数学上等价，这一等价性为时间序列分析开辟了新的机会，包括状态空间预测、流式处理扩展、外部输入整合以及噪声数据趋势可视化等应用前景。

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

Motivation: 传统深度均衡模型（DEQs）虽然通过单层迭代替代多层深度网络在大规模任务中表现优异，但其梯度计算是近似的，导致训练不稳定，需要正则化或大量函数评估来修正

Method: 引入可逆深度均衡模型（RevDEQs），通过可逆变换实现精确梯度计算，无需正则化，且比DEQs需要更少的函数评估

Result: RevDEQs在语言建模和图像分类任务上取得了最先进的性能，超越了同类隐式和显式模型

Conclusion: 可逆深度均衡模型解决了传统DEQs的梯度计算问题，提供了更稳定高效的训练方法，在多个重要任务上展现出优越性能

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and

performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

Result: 在五个数据集、三种模型架构上评估，包括针对定向和非定向现实攻击。Sy-FAR相比最先进方法显著改善了公平对抗鲁棒性，运行更快且更一致，同时减少了目标类别的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 对称性是一个更易实现且理想的目标，Sy-FAR方法有效提升了安全关键ML系统的公平对抗鲁棒性，解决了传统公平性方法在现实场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAPFL，这是首个专门针对原型联邦学习（PFL）框架的后门攻击方法，通过原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制，在保持主任务精度的同时显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型联邦学习（PFL）因其原型学习机制和数据异构性而对现有后门攻击具有天然抵抗力，但其安全性尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究PFL的安全漏洞并开发针对性的攻击方法。

Method: 提出BAPFL方法，包含两个核心组件：1）原型投毒策略，通过操纵全局原型轨迹误导良性客户端的原型训练；2）触发器优化机制，为每个目标标签学习独特且隐蔽的触发器，使触发样本原型与目标标签全局原型对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集和PFL变体上的实验表明，BAPFL相比传统后门攻击实现了35%-75%的攻击成功率提升，同时保持了主任务精度。

Conclusion: BAPFL证明了PFL框架存在安全漏洞，该方法具有高效性、隐蔽性和适应性，为PFL系统的安全防护提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

### [228] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于分位数部分效应(QPE)的因果发现方法，通过假设因果效应在有限线性空间中，直接从观测分布的形状不对称性识别因果方向，无需考虑噪声机制或马尔可夫假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能因果模型(FCMs)需要假设噪声形式，而QPE方法直接从观测层面的统计特性出发，提供更一般的因果可识别性理论框架。

Method: 1) 对估计的QPE进行基函数检验来区分双变量因果方向；2) 利用QPE与得分函数的紧密联系，通过Fisher信息量确定多变量因果顺序。

Result: 在大量双变量因果发现数据集上实验证明有效，在多变量合成和真实数据集上验证了使用Fisher信息识别因果顺序的可行性。

Conclusion: QPE方法提供了新的因果识别视角，直接从观测分布的形状特征出发，突破了传统FCMs的限制，在双变量和多变量因果发现中都表现出良好效果。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

*Ya Zhou,Yujie Yang,Xiaohan Fan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的后训练策略来增强ECG基础模型ECGFounder的性能，在PTB-XL基准测试中显著提升了各项指标，并表现出更好的稳定性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG基础模型虽然流行，但其临床适用性受到性能限制，即使在大规模ECG数据集上预训练并在目标数据上微调后，性能仍不如任务特定模型，这主要是缺乏有效的后训练策略。

Method: 提出了一种后训练方法，包括随机深度和预览线性探测等关键组件，用于增强ECGFounder模型（基于700多万ECG记录预训练的最先进ECG基础模型）。

Result: 在PTB-XL基准测试中，相比基线微调策略，macro AUROC提升1.2%-3.3%，macro AUPRC提升5.3%-20.9%；使用仅10%训练数据时，macro AUROC提升9.1%，macro AUPRC提升34.9%；优于多个最新最先进方法。

Conclusion: 后训练策略具有提升ECG基础模型性能的潜力，这项工作有望促进ECG领域基础模型的持续发展。

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

Method: ReTrack采用重要性采样构建更高效的微调损失，通过仅保留主导项来近似该损失，产生可解释的目标函数，将去噪轨迹重定向到k近邻，实现高效遗忘。

Result: 在MNIST T-Shirt、CelebA-HQ、CIFAR-10和Stable Diffusion上的实验表明，ReTrack实现了最先进的性能，在遗忘强度和生成质量保持之间达到了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ReTrack是一种有效的扩散模型数据遗忘方法，能够在保持生成质量的同时高效移除特定数据的影响，解决了扩散模型训练数据记忆化带来的隐私和安全问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

TL;DR: Spiking Vocos是一种基于脉冲神经网络的超低能耗神经声码器，在保持与ANN相当性能的同时，能耗仅为传统方法的14.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经声码器虽然合成速度和保真度有所提升，但高能耗限制了其在计算资源受限的边缘设备上的实际部署。SNN因其事件驱动特性而具有高能效优势，为低资源场景提供了有前景的解决方案。

Method: 基于高效的Vocos框架构建，设计了Spiking ConvNeXt模块减少MAC操作，引入幅度快捷路径保留关键信号动态，采用自架构蒸馏策略进行知识迁移，并集成轻量级时序移位模块增强时序信息融合能力。

Result: 模型性能与ANN对应版本相当，UTMOS和PESQ分数分别达到3.74和3.45，同时能耗仅为传统方法的14.7%。

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos成功实现了高性能与超低能耗的结合，为边缘设备上的神经声码器部署提供了有效的解决方案，证明了SNN在语音合成领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Traces Propagation (TP)的前向传播、内存高效、可扩展且完全局部的学习规则，用于脉冲神经网络的训练，解决了时空信用分配问题，在多个数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN训练方法如BPTT与生物神经系统的时空局部性相矛盾，计算和内存需求高；而现有的局部学习规则虽然实现了时间信用分配，但无法解决空间信用分配问题，需要辅助矩阵导致内存开销大。

Method: 提出TP学习规则，将资格迹与层间对比损失相结合，不需要辅助层间矩阵，实现了完全局部的前向传播学习。

Result: TP在NMNIST和SHD数据集上优于其他完全局部学习规则，在DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10等复杂数据集上表现竞争力，能有效扩展到VGG-9等深层SNN架构，内存扩展性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TP为边缘设备上的高效学习提供了可行方案，特别适用于实际微调任务如关键词识别，展示了在嵌入式设备上高效学习的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

Result: 在标准符号回归基准测试中，DiffuSR达到了与最先进自回归方法竞争的性能，并生成了更具可解释性和多样性的数学表达式。

Conclusion: DiffuSR框架通过扩散模型有效解决了符号回归问题，在保持竞争力的同时提供了更好的可解释性和多样性，为科学发现中的数学方程发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

Motivation: 高分辨率非结构化网格上的图神经网络训练成本过高，需要找到方法来加速收敛并降低计算开销。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，保持模型架构不变，仅改变训练数据的保真度，从粗网格开始训练，逐步过渡到中等和高分辨率网格。

Result: 在保持相当泛化精度的同时，总训练时间减少高达50%，在模型容量不足的情况下也能突破训练平台期。

Conclusion: 课程学习是加速图神经网络在计算流体动力学中训练的有效方法，无需改变模型架构即可显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Motivation: 图异质性对MP-GNNs性能构成挑战，特别是低通滤波器如GCN在异质图上性能下降，需要深入分析其性能表现和内在机制。

Method: 通过向异质图添加自环和平行边，观察图拉普拉斯矩阵特征值的变化，并在多个基准异质网络上测试GCN的性能趋势，建立图谱与性能之间的关系。

Result: 研究发现添加自环和平行边分别会降低和增加特征值，GCN性能呈现相应变化趋势，图谱能够表征图的内在属性如连通分量、稀疏性等。

Conclusion: 通过观察低通滤波器的性能趋势可以无缝评估图谱和属性，无需昂贵的特征值分解，为理解异质图上GCN性能提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

Conclusion: 研究结果为缓解公平性与准确性之间的传统权衡提供了新的方向，通过鲁棒性分析可以识别更可能被准确分类的实例。

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Conclusion: 该工作成功地将协方差神经网络扩展到无限维希尔伯特空间，为处理函数型数据和核希尔伯特空间数据提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了元学习在有限熵监督设置下比全类训练具有更紧的泛化边界，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒，并提出了MINO元学习框架来提升无监督性能。


<details>

Result: 元学习在有限熵下更高效，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒，MINO框架在多个无监督少样本和零样本任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 元学习在特定条件下具有明显优势，特别是在无监督任务中，MINO框架为元学习在无监督场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUST-FS是一种针对不完整多视图数据的无监督特征选择方法，通过张量分解框架同时处理特征选择、缺失变量填补和视图权重学习，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图无监督特征选择方法存在三个主要挑战：1）只能处理缺失视图，无法处理更一般的缺失变量场景；2）填补和特征选择过程相互独立；3）缺失数据导致相似性图不准确。

Method: 提出基于自适应加权CP分解的张量分解框架，同时进行特征选择、缺失变量填补和视图权重学习，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息来指导特征选择和填补。

Result: 综合实验结果表明该方法在效果和性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TRUST-FS通过统一的张量分解框架有效解决了不完整多视图数据中的特征选择问题，实现了填补和特征选择的协同优化。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向时间图注意力变换器(B-TGAT)的时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，用于高维多变量时空气候数据的高效聚类，在三个不同数据集上表现出优越的聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理高维时空气候数据时难以同时捕捉局部和全局时间关系并保持空间上下文，需要新的方法来应对复杂的时间依赖性和非平稳动态。

Method: 使用时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，编码器和解码器配备ConvLSTM2D模块提取联合时空特征，通过跳跃连接保持多尺度空间细节。在瓶颈处集成B-TGAT，结合基于图的空间建模和注意力驱动的时间编码。

Result: 在三个不同的时空气候数据集上实验表明，该方法在聚类分离性、时间稳定性和与已知气候转变的对齐方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM2D、U-Net跳跃连接和B-TGAT的集成提高了时间聚类性能，同时为复杂的时空变异性提供了可解释的见解，推动了方法学发展和气候科学应用。

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

TL;DR: HAM是一种新颖的分层适配器合并框架，通过动态组合不同任务的适配器来解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在多个视觉基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当面对新数据分布时，现有参数高效微调方法在动态学习场景和长任务序列中面临扩展性挑战。

Method: 提出分层适配器合并(HAM)框架，维护固定组集来分层整合新适配器，为每个任务训练低秩适配器和重要性标量，基于适配器相似性动态分组，在组内进行修剪、缩放和合并适配器。

Result: 在三个视觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HAM显著优于最先进方法，特别是在任务数量增加时表现更加突出。

Conclusion: HAM框架能够有效扩展管理更多任务，提高效率，通过动态适配器合并促进相关任务间的迁移学习，为解决持续学习挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DA-FPS的新型采样方法，用于在标注数据有限的情况下选择训练集，通过最小化加权填充距离来降低回归模型的预测误差上界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习回归任务中，由于计算限制或标注成本高昂，标注训练数据往往有限。需要从无标注数据中选择合适的训练集来平衡性能与效率

Method: 推导了Lipschitz连续回归模型预测误差的上界，该上界线性依赖于训练集的加权填充距离。提出了密度感知最远点采样(DA-FPS)方法，通过近似最小化加权填充距离的数据驱动估计来优化选择训练样本

Result: 在三个数据集上使用两种回归模型进行实验，结果显示DA-FPS相比其他采样策略显著降低了平均绝对预测误差

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的被动、模型无关的采样方法，能够通过优化数据特征表示来提升回归模型在有限标注数据场景下的性能

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL是一个统一的样本权重框架，通过单一可解释公式整合类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程、增强惩罚和预热动态，在数据不平衡和小样本场景中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀有疾病成像、基因组学和灾害响应等领域中数据不平衡和小样本的问题，现有方法如过采样、焦点损失或元加权等解决方案脆弱或复杂，需要统一的框架。

Method: 提出FOSSIL（Flexible Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning）框架，通过样本敏感重要性学习，将类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、增强惩罚和预热动态集成到单一可解释公式中。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，FOSSIL相比ERM、课程学习和元加权基线方法获得了持续的经验增益，且不需要架构更改。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个具有理论保证的统一权重框架，有效解决了数据不平衡和小样本学习问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的联邦学习后门攻击OBA，使用OOD数据作为毒化样本和触发器，并开发了SoDa方法提高隐蔽性。同时提出了BNGuard防御机制来检测和抵御此类攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击需要可见触发器和物理修改目标对象，攻击场景受限。为了解决这个问题，研究者希望开发更隐蔽、更实用的后门攻击方法。

Method: OBA使用分布外(OOD)数据同时作为毒化样本和触发器；SoDa通过正则化恶意本地模型的幅度和方向，使其与良性版本对齐以逃避检测；BNGuard利用批归一化层统计偏差来识别恶意模型更新。

Result: OBA能有效绕过最先进的防御机制，同时保持主任务的高准确率；BNGuard在各种设置下都能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了联邦学习中新型后门攻击的威胁，并提出了有效的防御方案，为联邦学习系统的安全性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

### [247] [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)
*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO是一种单流策略优化方法，通过持久化KL自适应值追踪器和全局优势归一化，解决了传统分组方法GRPO的退化组问题和可扩展性限制，在数学推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分组的策略梯度方法（如GRPO）存在两个关键缺陷：频繁出现的退化组会消除学习信号，同步障碍限制了可扩展性。需要一种更稳定、高效的方法来优化大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: SPO采用单流设计，用持久化的KL自适应值追踪器替代每组的基线，并在整个批次中全局归一化优势值，为每个样本提供稳定、低方差的学习信号。无需分组，支持更高吞吐量和可变生成时间的场景。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，SPO比GRPO收敛更平滑且达到更高准确率。在五个数学基准测试中，平均maj@32提升3.4个百分点，其中BRUMO 25提升7.3pp，AIME 25提升4.4pp，HMMT 25提升3.3pp。

Conclusion: SPO的成功挑战了为RL算法增加复杂性的趋势，表明通过基本原则而非架构变通可以推动LLM推理的下一波进展，提供了更稳健高效的优化路径。

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

*Aniket Didolkar,Nicolas Ballas,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将重复推理片段转化为可重用"行为"的方法，通过LLM的元认知分析创建行为手册，在推理时提供相关行为以减少token使用并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决多步问题时经常重复推导相同的中间步骤，导致token使用量增加、延迟增加，并减少了上下文窗口的探索能力。

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转化为简洁可重用的"行为"（名称+指令），存储在行为手册中，在推理时提供相关行为或通过监督微调将其蒸馏到参数中。

Result: 在三种设置下均取得改进：1)行为条件推理减少46%推理token同时保持或提高准确性；2)行为引导自改进无需参数更新即可提高10%准确性；3)行为条件SFT比普通SFT更有效地将非推理模型转化为推理模型。

Conclusion: 将缓慢的推导转化为快速的过程提示使LLM能够记住如何推理，而不仅仅是记住要得出什么结论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: NoRA是首个直接调整预训练Transformer模型中非线性激活函数的参数高效微调框架，通过可学习有理函数和结构化低秩更新，仅需0.4%参数即可达到或超越全参数微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要调整权重矩阵而保持激活函数固定，但激活函数作为模型非线性表达能力的关键组成部分，其适应性调整可能带来更好的微调效果。

Method: NoRA用可学习有理函数替换固定激活函数，对分子和分母系数应用结构化低秩更新，采用分组设计实现局部适应和稳定性提升，参数效率极高。

Result: 在CIFAR数据集上，NoRA仅更新0.02M参数(0.4%)就达到或超越全微调效果，准确率提升+0.17%-0.27%。与LoRA结合(NoRA++)在相同训练预算下表现更优，在LLaMA3-8B指令微调中MMLU平均提升+0.3%-0.8%。

Conclusion: 激活空间调优是权重基PEFT的补充性高效替代方案，激活函数应作为模型适应的首要调整对象，NoRA通过约束适应到低维函数子空间实现了隐式正则化。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种后处理单前向传播框架SPC-UQ，通过分割点分析(SPA)同时捕捉任意性和认知不确定性，无需重新训练预训练模型，在回归和分类任务中实现高效的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法要么计算成本高（如贝叶斯或集成方法），要么只能提供部分任务特定的估计（如单前向传播技术），需要一种既能高效计算又能全面捕捉不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分割点分析(SPA)将预测残差分解为上、下子集，计算每侧的平均绝对残差(MARs)。通过自一致性差异分数(SDS)进行细粒度认知估计。回归任务中使用分位数回归获得预测区间，分类任务中基于SPA校准softmax输出。

Result: 在多种回归和分类基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了多种最先进的不确定性量化方法，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SPC-UQ框架提供了一种高效、全面的不确定性量化解决方案，能够同时处理任意性和认知不确定性，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了JANUS框架，通过局部特征流形对齐和全局结构语义一致性，解决现有节点注入攻击方法的局部短视问题，显著提升了攻击效果和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络节点注入攻击方法主要依赖间接代理指标实现隐蔽性，缺乏对注入内容本质特征的考虑，且只关注局部结构模仿，存在局部短视问题。

Method: 提出双约束隐蔽节点注入框架JANUS：局部层面采用特征流形对齐策略实现几何一致性；全局层面引入结构化潜变量并通过最大化互信息确保注入结构与原始图语义模式一致；将注入攻击建模为序列决策过程，使用强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，JANUS框架在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JANUS框架通过同时考虑局部几何一致性和全局语义一致性，有效解决了节点注入攻击中的隐蔽性问题，为图神经网络安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional

accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National

was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High
School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates
three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有列车调度优化研究缺乏统一标准，代码和数据不公开，导致难以进行算法性能比较和复现

Method: 定义通用问题格式DISPLIB，收集多个真实工业案例的问题实例，提供参考求解器实现

Result: 建立了公开可用的数据集和标准格式，使研究者无需工业合作即可开展列车调度问题研究

Conclusion: DISPLIB为列车调度问题研究提供了标准化平台，将促进该领域的算法发展和性能比较

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了InPhyRe基准测试，用于评估大型多模态模型在违反物理规律的场景中进行归纳物理推理的能力，发现现有模型在这方面的表现存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型仅具备训练时见过的物理规律的参数化知识，无法在推理场景违反物理规律时进行有效推理。人类具有从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 提出InPhyRe视觉问答基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频来评估模型在违反物理规律的场景中预测碰撞结果的能力，并测试了13个大型多模态模型。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型难以将有限的参数化物理知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反物理规律时，模型的归纳物理推理能力很弱；(3)模型存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽略了视觉输入。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面存在严重局限性，对视觉输入的可信度受到质疑，这对其在安全关键应用中的可靠性提出了挑战。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

TL;DR: 提出LLMAP系统，结合LLM解析自然语言偏好和多步图搜索算法，实现多约束条件下的最优路线规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路线规划方法存在局限性：直接使用LLM处理地图数据能力不足，图搜索方法理解自然语言偏好能力有限，且用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建与迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路线查找，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个路由提示上进行实验，结果显示该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能

Conclusion: LLMAP系统能够有效处理自然语言驱动的路线规划问题，在保证多约束条件的同时实现最优路线规划

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Result: 物联网系统能持续在线发布温度、湿度等数据并调整控制参数；VGG-19算法在疾病检测中达到92%的最高准确率

Conclusion: 该智能温室系统成功实现了环境监控和植物疾病检测，VGG-19算法在识别干旱胁迫和锈病叶片方面表现最佳

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个开源的人类-AI协作框架，用于简化科学工作流的端到端创建，特别针对机器学习的综述和研究论文。系统整合了文献合成、实验、引用管理和LaTeX生成等模块化工具，同时保持人类监督以确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助研究工具虽然强大但碎片化，缺乏以人为本的工作流程。为了解决这些问题，开发一个集成化的、开源的Human-AI协作框架来简化科学工作流的创建。

Method: 开发AIssistant框架，包含模块化工具和代理用于文献合成、分段实验、引用管理和自动LaTeX论文生成。采用三层评估：独立人类评审（NeurIPS双盲标准）、自动化LLM评审（GPT-5作为人类评审代理）、程序主席监督。

Result: AIssistant提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但人类-AI协作对于保持事实正确性、方法合理性和伦理合规性仍然至关重要。存在引用幻觉、难以适应动态论文结构、多模态内容整合不完全等局限性。

Conclusion: AIssistant展示了在科学工作流中Human-AI协作的潜力，但需要进一步解决引用准确性、结构适应性和多模态整合等挑战，人类监督在确保学术严谨性方面仍然不可或缺。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解式方法，通过结构化交互摘要和意图提取来提升资源受限模型在UI交互轨迹中的意图理解能力，甚至超越大型多模态语言模型的基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在设备端运行的较小模型在准确推断用户意图方面的困难，这些模型虽然能提供隐私保护、低成本和低延迟的用户体验，但处理复杂UI交互序列的能力有限。

Method: 采用两阶段分解方法：首先进行结构化交互摘要，捕捉每个用户操作的关键信息；然后使用微调模型对聚合后的摘要进行意图提取。

Result: 该方法显著提升了资源受限模型的意图理解能力，甚至超过了大型多模态语言模型的基准性能。

Conclusion: 分解式方法为设备端智能代理提供了一种有效的意图理解解决方案，在保持隐私和低延迟的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于在多轮工具辅助设置中优化偏好学习，在SWE-bench基准测试中实现了开源模型的最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好优化方法（如DPO和KTO）虽然能有效对齐人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果，且这些方法主要针对单轮任务，无法充分处理多轮推理和工具集成所需的复杂性

Method: 引入\sys框架，通过增强偏好目标来显式保留策略熵，并将学习推广到优化多轮交互而非单轮响应。还提出了结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法的混合最佳轨迹选择方案

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，使用\sys训练的30B参数模型在开源权重模型中排名第一（Lite版本）和第四（Verified版本），仅被参数超过10倍（>350B）的模型超越

Conclusion: \sys框架成功地将偏好优化算法适应到多轮工具辅助设置中，通过保持输出多样性和优化多轮交互，显著提升了LLM在软件工程任务中的性能

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM是一个紧凑的鸟瞰图世界模型，通过Soft Mask训练和Warm Start推理技术，在保持小参数量的同时显著提升物理动态建模和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型部署中大小与性能的权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高难以部署到边缘设备，小模型物理学习能力不足导致预测效果差。

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask技术改进训练过程中的动态物体建模，并引入Warm Start推理技术提升零样本模型的预测质量。

Result: 在同等参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型提升60.6%的加权总分；最小PIWM(130M)相比最大基线模型(400M)获得7.4%更高的加权总分，且推理速度快28%。

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了小参数模型的高性能物理建模，为边缘设备部署高效世界模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

TL;DR: 论文提出Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC)方法，通过在剪枝过程中同时重构输入和思维链激活，显著提升推理语言模型的压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网路剪枝方法在推理语言模型上表现不佳，甚至会导致模型产生更多思考标记但性能下降，主要因为标准剪枝方法专注于输入重构，而推理是解码主导的任务

Method: 提出RAC方法，在剪枝过程中联合重构输入和模型在策略思维链轨迹的激活，该方法可与现有剪枝工作流（如SparseGPT）无缝集成

Result: RAC方法显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，解决了推理模型压缩中的性能损失问题

Conclusion: RAC是一种简单有效的drop-in修复方案，能够显著改善推理语言模型的压缩效果，代码已开源

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical

In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Method: 通过分析Soma Cube拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度）来量化任务难度，逐步改进试错搜索方法，包括预处理（认知分块）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）。

Result: 研究发现通过分层认知策略可以显著降低搜索复杂度，有效利用物理制品能够通过利用物理约束来降低时间复杂性。

Conclusion: 提出智能作为一个算法库的模型，该模型能够同时调用心智和物质的能力，强调物质性原则在降低认知任务复杂度中的重要作用。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

TL;DR: 本研究通过可解释的两步工作流程分析俄亥俄州环岛事故，识别出四种事故模式，并使用SHAP解释树模型量化伤害驱动因素，发现黑暗、湿滑路面和高速与固定物体或角度事件同时发生时严重性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环岛虽然减少了严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要可解释的分析方法来理解不同条件下的风险机制，以支持现场筛查、对策选择和审计就绪的报告。

Method: 采用两步可解释工作流程：首先使用聚类对应分析（CCA）识别共现因素并得出四种事故模式，然后使用基于树的严重性模型并通过SHAP进行解释，量化模式内和跨模式的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 研究结果显示，在黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速与固定物体或角度事件同时发生时事故严重性更高；在清晰、低速环境下严重性较低。模式特定解释突出了入口处（未能让行、间隙接受）、多车道循环内（不当操作）和减速期间（追尾）的机制。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at

(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety

retrieval performance via the analysis that ranking tasks are statically
equivalent to a Thurstone model. Based on the zELO method, we use unsupervised
data in order train a suite of state-of-the-art open-weight reranker models:
zerank-1 and zerank-1-small. These models achieve the highest retrieval scores

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Minerva CQ，一种基于Agentic AI的实时座席辅助系统，通过主动工作流和持续上下文构建来提升客服效率和客户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统客服中心存在处理时间长、首次解决率低和客户满意度差的问题，现有AI辅助工具多为被动响应，缺乏深度上下文推理能力。

Method: 采用Agentic AI方法，集成实时转录、意图识别、情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索和动态客户画像，构建主动式工作流系统。

Result: 在真实生产环境中部署的Minerva CQ作为AI副驾驶，显著提高了座席效率和客户体验。

Conclusion: Agentic AI驱动的主动式座席辅助系统能够有效解决传统客服中心的痛点，实现可衡量的业务改进。

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个使用大型语言模型生成专门化启发式集成组合，并通过自适应选择机制实现从实例特征到定制启发式集成通用映射的框架，解决了SAT求解器配置通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统冲突驱动子句学习求解器的性能依赖于内部启发式配置，但SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置不可行。现有的自动化方法虽然能为特定问题族找到专门配置，但缺乏泛化性且需要为新的问题类型重新优化，成本高昂。

Method: 使用大型语言模型，在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专门启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制来形成最终的映射关系，实现"一次训练，广泛适应"的模式。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越的性能，最重要的是在非自适应方法表现出局限性的情况下，展示了强大的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

TL;DR: AD-FCoT是一个基于类比推理和思维链提示的金融新闻情感分析框架，无需额外训练即可提升LLM在金融情感分类和市场回报预测方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉金融新闻的复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了金融情感分析的可靠性。

Method: 提出类比驱动的金融思维链(AD-FCoT)提示框架，通过引导LLM在新事件与已知结果的历史场景之间建立类比，并将这些类比嵌入结构化的逐步推理链中。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验显示，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性和市场回报相关性方面均优于强基线方法，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT通过纯提示方式有效提升了金融情感分析的性能和可解释性，为实际金融分析提供了适用的可解释洞察。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在Text2SQL生成中存在的语义鸿沟问题，即语法有效的查询经常误解用户意图，同时揭示基准测试数据质量问题的系统性影响。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，使用专门智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言以验证逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%的执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后，在Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）的执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还揭示了基准测试完整性的关键问题，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测牛群体重增长有助于大型养殖场优化饲养策略、做出明智育种决策，并降低气候变异和市场波动的风险。

Method: 使用随机森林(RF)模型，并与支持向量回归(SVR)和长短期记忆(LSTM)模型进行比较，利用756个样本数据和天气数据(降雨和温度)进行月度体重增长预测。

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上表现最佳，当包含天气和年龄因素时达到R²=0.973、RMSE=0.040和MAE=0.033。天气和年龄因素的加入显著提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: RF模型是预测牛群体重增长的强大工具，年龄和气候因素对牛群体重趋势有重要影响，研究还开发了公开的自动化预处理工具用于数据准备。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种新颖的心电图编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，使任何大型语言模型都能直接解释，解决了现有方法在可转移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ECG分析方法存在模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、以及黑盒性质限制临床采用等问题。

Method: 通过构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，ECG-aBcDe将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，无需架构修改即可直接微调预训练LLM，实现双向可转换性并提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上达到竞争性能，在BLEU-4上显著提升，数据集内和跨数据集评估分别提升2.8倍和3.9倍，达到42.58和30.76分。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，证明了该方法的可行性，显著提升了性能指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

TL;DR: AutoCO是一种端到端的自动化约束优化方法，利用大语言模型学习约束松弛策略，通过双向协同进化机制结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索，在非线性组合优化问题上取得优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖专家经验且缺乏系统性自动化，现有LLM优化方法主要作为被动约束验证器而非主动策略设计者，无法处理NCOPs中复杂的约束交互

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码；建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，将进化算法与蒙特卡洛树搜索相结合

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试上的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习约束松弛和双向协同进化机制，为非线性组合优化问题提供了革命性的端到端自动化解决方案

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法，以降低计算成本同时保持高性能。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型（2023年12月、2024年9月、2025年6月），评估其准确性和对上下文学习推理策略的忠实度。提出神经符号架构：用小参数LLM将问题标准化，然后用Z3 SMT求解器解析。

Result: 2023到2024年的性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024到2025年思维模型的引入带来显著改进。神经符号方法将计算成本显著降低（FLOPs减少），同时保持近乎完美的性能。推理FLOPs约为活跃参数与总token数乘积的两倍，实验误差在10%以内。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续提升，神经符号架构为高效推理提供了可行方案，能在大幅降低计算成本的同时维持高性能，为实际应用提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一个无需训练的图推理方法，利用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM的代码生成能力，通过生成可执行代码查询图数据库来解决各种图推理任务，在大多数任务上达到100%准确率且能扩展到万节点大图。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在通过结合RAG和LLM的代码生成能力，开发一种无需训练、通用且高效的图推理解决方案。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息。采用错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务（环检测、二分图检查、最短路径、最大流）达到100%准确率，子图匹配性能也很高。可扩展到10,000个节点的大图，且token成本与图大小无关。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种有效且可扩展的训练免费图推理方法，通过代码生成和检索增强技术成功解决了传统方法的局限性，在大规模图处理方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Result: 在两个基准测试中，H²R能够提高泛化能力和决策性能，优于Expel等基线方法

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制能够有效实现细粒度知识迁移，显著提升LLM智能体在多任务场景中的表现

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker是一个潜在思维增强训练框架，通过增加潜在思维分布的方差和引入基于分布的定向优化范式，提升大语言模型的复杂推理能力，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SoftCoT++表明潜在思维分布的更大方差能更好地逼近真实分布，但高效生成和利用高质量潜在思维仍是核心瓶颈，需要从训练框架层面进行优化。

Method: 1. 基于可学习先验的潜在思维生成架构，增加潜在思维向量的分布方差；2. 基于分布的定向优化范式，结合语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理聚焦损失（对比学习），联合约束分布局部性和规模。

Result: 实验显示LTA-Thinker在各种基线中达到最先进的性能，表现出更高的性能上限和更好的扩展效果。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强潜在思维分布方差和引入多目标协同训练策略，有效提升了复杂推理任务的性能，为动态优化大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides

management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HLSMAC是一个基于三十六计设计的新型多智能体强化学习基准，包含12个星际争霸II场景，专注于评估高层战略决策能力，超越了传统微操基准的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL基准如SMAC主要关注微操层面，缺乏对高层战略智能的全面评估，需要新的基准来测试多智能体在复杂战略环境中的决策能力。

Method: 基于三十六计设计了12个星际争霸II场景，每个场景对应一个特定计策，引入多维度评估指标（能力利用率和推进效率等），并集成最先进的MARL算法和LLM智能体进行测试。

Result: 实验结果表明HLSMAC能够有效评估多智能体的战略决策能力，为推进多智能体战略决策研究提供了强大的测试平台。

Conclusion: HLSMAC成功填补了MARL基准在高层战略评估方面的空白，为多智能体战略决策能力的发展提供了重要的测试环境和评估标准。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSRL是一种透明的对齐框架，使用轻量级适配器通过调节稀疏自编码器的可解释特征来引导大语言模型行为，效果与RLHF相当但更具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLHF方法导致参数变化分散且不透明，难以理解模型内部学到了什么，需要更透明的对齐方法。

Method: 使用特征引导强化学习(FSRL)，训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器(SAE)的可解释特征，实现模型行为的透明控制。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略系统性地提升风格特征而非显式对齐概念。

Conclusion: FSRL为可解释模型控制和诊断对齐机制提供了工具，发现偏好优化过程将风格呈现作为质量的代理进行奖励。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

TL;DR: 提出Evo-Merging方法，通过进化算法实现黑盒大语言模型的融合，仅需推理API查询即可完成模型合并，无需访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供服务的黑盒大语言模型，无法获取权重参数，因此需要开发新的黑盒模型融合方法。

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含两个关键组件：(1)基于稀疏性的去噪，识别和过滤无关或冗余信息；(2)符号感知缩放，根据性能动态计算最优组合权重。

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进水平，显著优于现有强基线方法。

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型融合的挑战，仅通过API查询即可实现高质量的模型合并。

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了隐私增强持续学习框架PeCL，通过动态差分隐私策略和隐私引导记忆雕刻模块，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀差分隐私方法在持续学习中会过度保护所有数据，导致模型性能显著下降，阻碍了在隐私敏感领域的应用

Method: 1. 基于语义敏感性的token级动态差分隐私策略；2. 隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息并保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了优越平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了持续学习中的隐私挑战，为隐私敏感场景下的持续学习部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个集成多种规划工具的聊天机器人，通过自然语言指令调用工具，显著提升LLMs在长程规划任务中的表现，甚至优于GPT-5


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏可靠的长程规划能力，需要外部工具支持来弥补这一缺陷

Method: 基于Model Context Protocol标准，集成多种规划工具（语法检查、规划器选择、调用、验证和执行模拟），支持任何兼容MCP的LLM而无需领域特定微调

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot显著优于相同LLM无工具的情况，在有限定性比较中甚至大幅超越GPT-5

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs能够有效执行规划任务的有效途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则（AKP）及其反向模式在不同文本媒介中的适用性，探索成功与失败的结构模式差异。

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影等不同媒介。

Result: 不同媒介呈现不同结构模式：小说在顺序上呈现反向AKP，维基百科结合AKP和有序模式，学术论文在顺序上呈现反向AKP但在位置上保持噪声，电影则因类型而异。

Conclusion: 成功依赖于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域中呈现出多样化的形态，结构原则因媒介类型而异。

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含369个大学录取问题实例的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的表现，发现LLMs在满足所有约束条件方面存在困难，推理模型表现优于传统模型，不同提示策略效果各异，迭代提示性能非单调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学推理和组合优化方面表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，因此需要建立专门的评估基准。

Method: 创建了大学录取问题的基准数据集，评估多个开源LLM在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度的表现，测试了Chain-of-Thought、In-Context Learning和基于角色的提示等策略，并进行了迭代提示实验。

Result: LLMs难以一致满足所有评估标准；推理模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型（Llama、Qwen、Mistral）；不同提示策略效果差异明显且无一致性最优策略；迭代提示性能呈现非单调变化，可能早期达到峰值后下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新视角，强调了匹配问题对LLMs的挑战性以及需要更精细的推理机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，而基于对偶射线分析的方法在处理伪布尔约束模型时可能失效，需要更高效的冲突检测方法

Method: 基于冲突驱动子句学习(CDCL)思想，在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测到冲突时追踪所有贡献约束，生成冲突集，可选使用QuickXplain进一步最小化为IIS

Result: 开发了G-CSEA算法，能够有效提取冲突集，减少求解器调用次数，提高不可行性诊断效率

Conclusion: 图基冲突集提取方法为伪布尔约束调度模型的不可行性诊断提供了更高效的解决方案，特别适用于规则复杂的劳动力调度问题

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中的应用，比较了GPT-4o和MedGemma两种模型，发现MedGemma在基线性能上更优，而GPT-4o在结合MedGemma描述性输出时表现出色，表明MLLMs可改善DR筛查流程并作为临床AI辅助研究的可扩展模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。研究旨在确定最有效的输出格式来增强临床医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上测试GPT-4o（通用MLLM）和MedGemma（开源医疗模型），包括基线评估、模拟AI辅助实验以及实际的AI间协作实验，其中GPT-4o整合MedGemma的输出。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o，具有更高的敏感性和AUROC。GPT-4o在结合MedGemma的描述性输出时即使没有直接图像访问也能达到高达0.96的AUROC。两种模型都能根据模拟AI输入调整预测，但GPT-4o在错误输入下性能崩溃，而MedGemma更稳定。

Conclusion: MLLMs可以改善糖尿病视网膜病变筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开源轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，描述性输出可增强临床工作流程中的可解释性和临床医生信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 随着人工智能向通用人工智能(AGI)发展，现有记忆系统存在适应性有限、多模态整合不足、无法支持持续学习等问题，需要构建更健壮和类人的记忆系统。

Method: 采用场景驱动方法，从代表性认知场景中提取关键功能需求，形成统一的设计原则，并基于此提出COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)框架，将认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制整合为统一设计。

Result: 开发出COLMA架构，为构建能够进行终身学习和类人推理的AI系统提供了结构化基础。

Conclusion: COLMA架构通过整合认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制，为实用AGI的发展做出了贡献，解决了当前AI记忆系统的主要局限性。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够在大型语言模型中实现精确的行为干预，仅需少量数据和计算资源即可隔离特定概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预和更细粒度的模型行为理解。

Method: 提出RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式隔离概念特定的表示，能够从少量示例中提取稳健的目标表示，并将矫正信号定位到100-200个神经元。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上，RepIt能够精确抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他方面的拒绝能力，使模型能够回答WMD相关问题但在标准基准测试中仍保持安全评分。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也引发了关于操纵可能性的双重担忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一种新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆化的知识星座来模拟语言智能体，使其能够像人类一样通过模式识别、类比推理等方式处理复杂现实问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言智能体在复杂现实环境中的认知处理问题，提出一种能够模拟人类认知方式的新范式，使智能体能够以最小认知负荷处理典型情况，并在异常情况下采取恢复策略。

Method: 基于形状的建模方法，整合感官、语言、概念、情景和程序性知识，形成记忆化的知识星座，采用特定的认知架构实现模式识别、类比推理和满意度决策等认知过程。

Result: 提出了一个具体的认知建模框架，能够实现解释性强、可扩展且值得信赖的智能体系统，即使在关键领域也能可靠运行。

Conclusion: 形状认知范式不仅适用于语言智能体建模，其原理可以更广泛地应用于知识驱动和混合人工智能领域，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

Abstract: The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation
for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often
necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with
long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique
challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the
geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large.
Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but
this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a
temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera
trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key
idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure
called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline
methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.
