### [1] [PolypSeg-GradCAM: Towards Explainable Computer-Aided Gastrointestinal Disease Detection Using U-Net Based Segmentation and Grad-CAM Visualization on the Kvasir Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18159)
*Akwasi Asare,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，结合U-Net和Grad-CAM实现可解释的息肉分割，在Kvasir-SEG数据集上达到0.9257的IoU和0.96以上的Dice系数，增强临床信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球主要癌症死因，胃肠道息肉是关键前兆。现有深度学习方法分割准确但缺乏可解释性，阻碍临床应用。

Method: 集成U-Net架构和梯度加权类激活映射(Grad-CAM)，构建可解释的息肉分割框架，在1000张标注内镜图像数据集上训练评估。

Result: 测试集平均IoU达0.9257，训练和验证集Dice系数均高于0.96，Grad-CAM可视化证实预测基于临床相关区域。

Conclusion: PolypSeg-GradCAM将高分割精度与可解释性结合，为可靠AI辅助结肠镜检查和结直肠癌早期预防迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

*Sherwin Bahmani,Tianchang Shen,Jiawei Ren,Jiahui Huang,Yifeng Jiang,Haithem Turki,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell,Zan Gojcic,Sanja Fidler,Huan Ling,Jun Gao,Xuanchi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自蒸馏框架，将视频扩散模型中的隐式3D知识蒸馏到显式的3D高斯溅射表示中，无需多视图训练数据即可生成3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D重建方法依赖真实世界多视图数据，但这些数据并不总是容易获得。视频扩散模型具有强大的想象力，但其2D特性限制了在需要与环境交互的模拟应用中的使用。

Method: 在典型RGB解码器基础上增加3D高斯溅射解码器，通过RGB解码器的输出进行监督训练。3DGS解码器可以完全使用视频扩散模型生成的合成数据进行训练。支持从文本提示或单张图像实时渲染3D场景，并可扩展到从单目视频生成动态3D场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在静态和动态3D场景生成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自蒸馏框架成功地将视频扩散模型的2D想象力转化为实用的3D表示，为游戏、机器人、自动驾驶等领域的虚拟环境生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### [4] [Self Identity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165)
*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SIM（自身份映射）正则化框架，通过逆映射机制重构输入来减少前向传播中的信息损失，提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法依赖启发式规则，在不同设置下效果不稳定。需要一种数据内在的正则化方法来增强泛化能力。

Method: 使用逆映射机制从变换后的输出重构输入，通过补丁级特征采样和基于投影的方法降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在图像分类、少样本提示学习和领域泛化等任务上均优于基线方法，且与现有正则化方法正交，能进一步提升其效果。

Conclusion: SIM是一种模型无关、任务无关的即插即用正则化模块，能有效保留语义信息，适用于视觉和非视觉领域的多种任务。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

*Zhanting Zhou,Jinbo Wang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIA是一种基于动量的自适应梯度反演攻击方法，能够在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下实现高保真多图像重建，特别是在大批量场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在具有挑战性的单轮平均梯度SAG机制下的梯度反演问题，其中每个样本的线索都纠缠在单个批次平均梯度中。

Method: MAGIA框架包含两个核心创新：1）封闭形式的组合重缩放，创建可证明更紧的优化边界；2）基于动量的整批和子集损失混合，确保重建鲁棒性。该方法通过探测随机数据子集来感知潜在的每图像信号。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIA显著优于先进方法，在大批量场景中实现了高保真多图像重建，而先前的方法在此类场景中失败。

Conclusion: MAGIA在计算足迹与标准求解器相当的情况下，无需任何辅助信息就能实现高性能梯度反演攻击。

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean
gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient
inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Baseer模型，专门针对阿拉伯语文档OCR进行优化的视觉语言模型，通过大规模数据集和解码器微调策略，显著提升了阿拉伯语OCR性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语文档OCR面临挑战，包括草书字体、多样化字体、变音符号和从右到左的书写方向。现有的多模态大语言模型在高资源语言上表现良好，但在阿拉伯语上性能有限

Method: 使用结合合成和真实文档的大规模数据集，采用解码器微调策略对预训练MLLM进行适配，同时保留通用视觉特征。还提出了Misraj-DocOCR高质量基准

Result: Baseer显著优于现有的开源和商业解决方案，WER达到0.25，在阿拉伯语文档OCR领域建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 特定领域适配通用MLLM具有显著优势，为形态丰富语言（如阿拉伯语）的高精度OCR建立了强大基线

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

### [7] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176)
*Wendong Yao,Saeed Azadnejad,Binhua Huang,Shane Donohue,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，将稀疏的InSAR时序数据转换为密集的时空张量，首次实现了将先进计算机视觉架构直接应用于地面变形预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏的InSAR时序数据预测未来地面变形是一个重大挑战，这对城市基础设施稳定性和地质灾害缓解至关重要。

Method: 设计并实现了一个混合CNN-LSTM模型，专门用于同时从生成的数据张量中学习空间模式和时间依赖性。

Result: 与LightGBM和LASSO回归等基线模型相比，所提架构提供了显著更准确和空间一致的预测，为该任务建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了时空深度学习在高分辨率变形预测中的有效性和潜力，基线模型往往默认使用简单的持续性模式，突显了集成时空方法的必要性。

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

### [8] [A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177)
*George Corrêa de Araújo,Helena de Almeida Maia,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Scrapbook框架，用于生成大规模数据集来测试AI模型对基本概念（如物体识别、位置关系、属性识别）的理解能力。实验发现当前模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在位置理解和约束性问题处理上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统性地评估AI模型对基本概念的理解能力，为处理更复杂任务奠定基础。现有方法缺乏对基础概念的全面测试框架。

Method: 开发Scrapbook框架，通过生成大量关于单个概念的问题和广泛的语言变体来创建数据集，用于验证模型对基本元素的理解。

Result: 当代模型在物体识别和枚举方面表现熟练，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时遇到挑战。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著的回答不一致和错误答案，其他模型则表现出肯定回答偏见，在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化数据集提供了有价值的工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型性能，揭示了当前模型在基础概念理解方面的改进空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

### [9] [The Describe-Then-Generate Bottleneck: How VLM Descriptions Alter Image Generation Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18179)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析量化了视觉-语言-视觉管道中描述-生成瓶颈造成的信息损失，发现99.3%的样本存在显著感知退化，91.5%存在结构信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI系统在创意工作流程中的集成日益增多，理解视觉-语言-视觉管道中的信息损失对于评估系统局限性变得重要，但目前通过文本中介传递视觉内容时的退化程度仍缺乏量化研究。

Method: 生成了150对图像通过描述-生成管道，并应用现有指标（LPIPS、SSIM和颜色距离）来测量感知、结构和色彩维度上的信息保存情况。

Result: 评估显示99.3%的样本表现出显著的感知退化，91.5%的样本显示出显著的结构信息损失。

Conclusion: 描述-生成瓶颈代表了当代多模态系统中可测量且一致的局限性，这为系统改进提供了实证基础。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI驱动的工作流程，通过高分辨率卫星影像自动推断屋顶属性，用于小岛屿发展中国家（SIDS）的建筑结构信息获取，以支持灾害风险评估和城市韧性规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多气候脆弱地区（如加勒比地区）的小岛屿发展中国家缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了灾害风险评估和城市韧性规划的能力。

Method: 比较了地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估了引入邻近SIDS额外训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到了0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该工作旨在为SIDS提供利用AI和地球观测数据的新能力，实现更高效、基于证据的城市治理。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

### [11] [VLA-LPAF: Lightweight Perspective-Adaptive Fusion for Vision-Language-Action to Enable More Unconstrained Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18183)
*Jinyue Bian,Zhaoxing Zhang,Zhengyu Liang,Shiwei Zheng,Shengtao Zhang,Rong Shen,Chen Yang,Anzhou Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VLA-LPAF轻量级模块，通过仅使用2D数据来增强视觉-语言-动作模型的视角适应性，有效解决多视角视觉特征差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在处理来自不同视角的视觉观察时存在局限性，因为不同环境中的摄像头数量和视角差异导致视觉特征显著不同，这种视角异质性限制了VLA模型的通用性。

Method: 提出VLA-LPAF模块，使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间中融合多视角观察，有效桥接视角不一致带来的差距。以RoboFlamingo模型为基础构建RoboFlamingo-LPAF框架。

Result: 实验显示RoboFlamingo-LPAF在CALVIN数据集上平均提升约8%的任务成功率，在LIBERO上提升15%，在定制化仿真基准上提升30%。真实世界任务验证了其视角自适应特性。

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF能够有效且高效地解决VLA模型在多视角环境中的适应性问题，显著提升模型性能并具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

latency, offering significant advantages over conventional frame-based cameras.
In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement network called URNet
for event-based stereo depth estimation. Our approach features a local-global
refinement module that effectively captures fine-grained local details and
long-range global context. Additionally, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence-based uncertainty modeling method to enhance prediction reliability.
Extensive experiments on the DSEC dataset demonstrate that URNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症常导致慢性盆腔疼痛和可能的神经受累，但周围神经的成像仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 该框架包含两个阶段：(A)使用深度学习模型自动分割解剖结构，(B)通过符号空间推理进行纤维束追踪和神经识别。

Result: 在10名子宫内膜异位症患者的腰骶丛神经应用中，Visionerves相比标准纤维束追踪方法有显著改进，Dice评分提高达25%，空间误差减少到小于5mm。

Conclusion: 这种自动且可重复的方法能够进行详细的神经分析，为子宫内膜异位症相关神经病变以及其他涉及神经的疾病的非侵入性诊断铺平了道路。

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要来自发达国家，缺乏新兴经济体驾驶行为的多样性，且驾驶员面部记录侵犯隐私。需要开发能够代表巴基斯坦等国家真实驾驶环境的数据集。

Method: 使用定制Android应用程序收集高频率加速度计、陀螺仪和GPS数据，并与连续视频同步，数据分为原始层、处理层和语义层。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HazeFlow是一个基于ODE的新框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为常微分方程，通过单次推理实现真实世界图像去雾，并利用马尔可夫链布朗运动生成非均匀雾霾数据来增强模型适应性。

Motivation: 深度学习方法在图像去雾任务中面临缺乏配对真实世界训练数据和领域差距的问题，传统基于大气散射模型的方法难以处理真实世界的复杂性和多样雾霾模式。

Method: 提出HazeFlow框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为ODE，学习从雾霾图像到清晰图像的最优ODE轨迹；引入基于马尔可夫链布朗运动的非均匀雾霾生成方法来缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和创新的雾霾生成方法，有效解决了真实世界图像去雾的挑战，展示了优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法具有高效性、可扩展性和通用性，为实际临床应用提供了低成本解决方案，并能与现有CT基础模型成功集成

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞分割任务上的表现，发现3D U-Net ResNet架构效果最佳，CNN模型优于ViT模型，分类预训练可能损害分割性能，远端栓塞分割仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺栓塞分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对不同分割架构在统一框架下的系统性比较。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为肺栓塞分割任务提供性能基准。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描构建内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种CNN和ViT分割架构，比较预训练和随机初始化权重的影响。

Result: 最佳模型达到平均Dice分数0.7131，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓塞，49个假阳性和28个假阴性。3D U-Net ResNet表现最优，CNN模型普遍优于ViT模型。

Conclusion: 3D CNN架构特别适合肺栓塞分割任务，分类预训练可能不利于分割性能，远端栓塞分割仍是挑战，需要更高质量的数据集。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手形在手语中具有基本音系作用，但计算方法很少显式建模手形，限制了识别准确性和语言分析。

Method: 结合解剖学信息图结构和对比学习，解决手形识别中的关键挑战，包括细微的类间差异和时间变化。

Result: 建立了签名序列中结构化手形识别的首个基准，在37个手形类别上达到46%的准确率（基线方法为25%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了手形识别性能，为手语计算分析提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph
neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape
configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods
achieving 25%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了胎儿超声图像中可靠分布外检测的重要性，发现分类任务本身对OOD检测性能有显著影响，最佳任务选择取决于ID-OOD标准类型（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在胎儿超声图像存在异质性和不同临床设置的背景下，可靠的OOD检测对于深度学习模型的安全部署至关重要。现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，而本文重点研究分类任务本身的影响。

Method: 通过八个不确定性量化方法在四个分类任务上的实验，分析OOD检测性能与任务选择的关系，区分图像特征偏移和解剖特征偏移两种ID-OOD标准。

Result: 实验表明OOD检测性能随任务显著变化，最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准类型。同时发现优越的OOD检测性能并不保证最优的弃权预测性能。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，需要根据具体下游应用来协调任务选择和不确定性策略，不能仅依赖OOD检测性能作为唯一指标。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OrthoLoC数据集，这是第一个大规模无人机图像与正射地理数据配对的数据集，用于解决在资源受限环境下的高精度视觉定位问题，并提出了AdHoP优化技术显著提升匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无互联网连接或GPS支持的资源受限场景下，现有基于大型图像数据库或重型3D模型的视觉定位方法不实用。正射地理数据轻量且日益普及，但尚未被充分用于视觉定位。

Method: 创建包含16,425张无人机图像的OrthoLoC数据集，涵盖德国和美国多个模态。数据集采用配对结构，将图像检索与特征匹配解耦。提出AdHoP优化技术，可与任何特征匹配器集成。

Result: 通过全面评估分析了域偏移、数据分辨率和共可见性对定位精度的影响。AdHoP技术将匹配性能提升高达95%，平移误差降低高达63%。

Conclusion: OrthoLoC数据集为无人机视觉定位提供了公平的基准测试平台，证明了正射地理数据作为轻量级替代方案的可行性，AdHoP技术显著提升了定位性能。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中缺乏训练数据的问题，仅凭单张测试图像实现异常检测

Method: 基于深度图像先验，采用基于块的训练框架，通过掩码、块打乱和噪声避免恒等映射，使用感知损失捕获结构信息

Result: 在MVTec-AD上达到0.99 AUROC和0.60 AUPRC，在织物数据集上达到0.98 AUROC和0.67 AUPRC，优于现有方法

Conclusion: SSDnet在零样本设置下有效实现了单图像异常定位，无需外部训练数据或参考样本

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言视觉-语言模型中的对齐问题，避免模型生成关于错误对象的流利文本，主要挑战包括配对数据稀缺、翻译枢纽破坏对齐以及英语中心预训练忽略目标语言语义

Method: 使用LaBSE验证的英-孟配对数据和11万双语提示合成图像训练管道，采用冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征，孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码，轻量级桥接模块连接模态。核心创新是三重损失函数：PAL对齐真实和合成图像块描述符，InfoNCE强制全局分离，Sinkhorn-based OT确保细粒度对应

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.29、METEOR 27.98、BERTScore-F1 71.20；在MSCOCO-1k上达到BLEU-4 12.00、METEOR 28.14、BERTScore-F1 75.40，优于强CE基线，将真实-合成质心差距缩小41%

Conclusion: 提出的三重损失协同方法有效改善了低资源孟加拉语视觉-语言模型的对齐性能，减少了虚假匹配，为低资源语言的多模态学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的运动模糊球体标注策略，将球标注在模糊条纹的中心而非传统的前缘位置，并显式标注模糊属性，从而提升检测性能和轨迹预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注方法将球标记在模糊条纹的前缘，这引入了不对称性并忽略了与速度相关的运动线索。运动模糊降低了快速移动物体的清晰度，特别是在球拍运动中，球常以条纹而非清晰点出现。

Method: 提出新的标注策略，将球置于模糊条纹中心并显式标注模糊属性；开发BlurBall模型，通过多帧输入的Squeeze-and-Excitation注意力机制联合估计球位置和运动模糊属性。

Result: 该标注方法在各种模型上一致提升了检测性能；BlurBall模型在球检测任务上达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 利用模糊信息不仅提高了检测精度，还实现了更可靠的轨迹预测，有利于实时体育分析。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模开放词汇检测器在视频每帧上运行计算成本过高的问题，寻求一种无需训练、无需标签的高效检测方案。

Method: 在固定间隔的关键帧上运行OWLv2检测器，使用压缩域运动向量将检测结果传播到中间帧，采用3x3网格聚合运动向量进行平移和均匀尺度更新。

Result: 在ILSVRC2015-VID数据集上达到mAP@0.5=0.609，在宽松IoU阈值下接近逐帧检测性能，优于基于跟踪器的传播方法。

Conclusion: 压缩域传播是减少检测器调用次数的实用方法，同时保持视频中的强零样本覆盖能力。

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了HDR光照估计方法的颜色鲁棒性，发现使用预训练的白平衡网络预处理输入图像可以显著提高现有模型在颜色准确性方面的表现，且无需重新训练光照估计模型。

Motivation: 现有HDR光照估计方法在颜色准确性方面存在不足，而颜色是影响增强现实应用中视觉真实感的关键因素。作者希望探索简单的适应技术是否能提升现有模型的颜色鲁棒性。

Method: 使用包含多样化光照颜色的新型HDR数据集，系统评估了几种适应策略，包括使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的方法在所有测试场景中都优于其他策略，显著提高了颜色鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，在三种最先进的光照估计方法上都验证了其有效性，为提升AR应用中虚拟对象渲染的真实感提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的免训练支票字段检测框架，实现零样本检测支票关键字段，解决传统方法对大量标注数据的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支票在金融交易中广泛使用但易受欺诈，传统支票字段检测需要大量标注数据，而由于隐私和专有性问题，这类数据稀缺。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型(VLM)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)构建免训练框架，通过零样本学习自动检测支票的关键字段（签名、MICR线、金额等）。

Result: 在包含110张不同格式支票的手工标注数据集上评估，模型表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅降低了实际部署的门槛，还能作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制，为开发专门的实时目标检测模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

Motivation: 现有图表理解基准假设图表清晰且查询基于事实，但现实世界图表常包含失真并需要复杂推理。需要评估模型在退化条件下的表现。

Method: 评估ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro在图表噪声和遮挡下的表现，引入CHART NOISe数据集结合图表损坏、遮挡和反向不一致性测试。

Result: 模型在图表退化条件下性能急剧下降，幻觉问题（如数值捏造、趋势误读、实体混淆）更频繁，模型在退化设置下仍过度自信。

Conclusion: 建立了严格的测试基准来推进图表理解的鲁棒性和可靠性，提出了质量过滤和遮挡检测等基线缓解策略。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D-MRI重建方法存在无法捕捉时间变异性、工作流程复杂、计算负担重等问题，需要更高效的连续运动建模方法。

Method: 使用双网络框架：空间解剖网络（SAN）编码连续3D解剖表示，时序运动网络（TMN）基于Transformer生成的呼吸信号产生时间一致的变形场。

Result: 在19名志愿者的自由呼吸数据集上验证，方法能准确捕捉规则和不规则呼吸模式，处理时间从5小时缩短到15分钟，单次3D体积推断时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在4D放射治疗规划和实时自适应治疗中具有强大应用潜力，实现了高效准确的呼吸运动重建。

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在快速移动微小物体（如壁球）跟踪中的性能，发现DeepOCSORT跟踪误差最小但所有方法都存在显著跟踪漂移，表明现有方法在处理快速移动微小物体方面存在根本性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速移动微小物体的不可预测运动模式和小视觉标记使得精确跟踪成为计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中，轻量级准确的跟踪系统可以改善机器人感知和规划能力。

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估五种最先进的基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法（OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT），重点分析推理速度和每图像更新频率对跟踪精度的影响。

Result: DeepOCSORT实现最低跟踪误差（平均ADE 31.15像素），ByteTrack处理速度最快（平均推理时间26.6ms），但所有跟踪器都表现出显著的跟踪漂移，空间误差范围3-11cm（ADE值31-114像素）。

Conclusion: 当前跟踪方法需要重大改进，误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍，突显了针对快速移动微小物体跟踪应用需要专门方法的需求。

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频动作识别方法计算成本高，难以在资源受限环境中实时部署。压缩域视频中的运动向量信息未被充分利用，可以用于高效的动作识别。

Method: MoCrop包含三个轻量级组件：去噪与合并(DM)、蒙特卡洛采样(MCS)和自适应裁剪(AC)。通过运动密度子矩阵搜索定位运动密集区域，生成单个剪辑级裁剪应用于所有I帧。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在保持相同FLOPs时提升Top-1准确率3.5%，或在减少26.5%FLOPs时提升2.4%准确率。应用于CoViAR模型时，在原始计算成本下达到89.2%准确率，减少计算量后仍保持88.5%准确率。

Conclusion: MoCrop具有训练免费、无参数添加、通用性强等优点，在多种骨干网络上均表现一致，为压缩域实时视频动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B
indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment
in the compressed domain. Our code and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低比特率条件下性能不佳，因为它们保留了过多冗余细节或学习了过度集中的符号分布，需要一种更有效的特征压缩方法

Method: 使用代码本和向量量化将连续视觉特征映射为离散索引，选择性传输到云端，保留更多信息丰富的视觉模式

Result: 实验证明该方法在速率和准确性方面具有优越性，对低比特率条件更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架通过语义增强的代码本自适应特征压缩，有效解决了低比特率条件下的特征压缩挑战

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中现有方法计算复杂度高、参数量大，难以在资源受限设备上实时运行的问题

Method: 设计多核深度卷积块(MKDC)处理多分辨率空间关系，结合通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制增强显著特征

Conclusion: MK-UNet为资源受限环境下的实时高保真医学诊断提供了前所未有的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

rigs 3D Gaussians to a CT mesh, enabling joint optimization of Gaussian
parameters and mesh deformation through photometric supervision. By
parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce
alignment between Gaussians and mesh and obtain deformations that can be
propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on
visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation,
showing sensible deformations of the preoperative CT on monocular RGB data.

Conclusion: 提出的扩散引导标签增强方法为源自由域适应中的伪标签优化问题提供了有效解决方案，通过从高质量种子标签出发的传播策略实现了更好的域适应效果。

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Result: 在C2FSCIL基准测试中，该方法有效提升了粗类和细类分类的准确率

Conclusion: 双曲空间嵌入为C2FSCIL任务提供了更有效的表示学习框架，特别是在少样本条件下表现出色

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

*Zixin Zhu,Haoxiang Li,Xuelu Feng,He Wu,Chunming Qiao,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架GeoRemover，用于智能图像编辑中的物体移除，能够同时移除目标物体及其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射），解决了现有方法要么无法移除未明确掩码的因果效应，要么缺乏可控性可能过度擦除其他物体的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像外观基于的方法在物体移除时存在局限性：严格掩码对齐的方法无法移除未明确掩码的因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射），而松散掩码对齐的方法缺乏可控性可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效应之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出几何感知的两阶段框架：1）几何移除阶段：使用严格掩码对齐监督直接从几何（如深度）中移除物体，实现具有强几何约束的结构感知编辑；2）外观渲染阶段：基于更新后的几何条件渲染逼真的RGB图像，其中因果视觉效应作为修改后3D几何的结果被隐式考虑。在几何移除阶段引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标，鼓励模型移除物体及其因果视觉伪影，同时避免新的结构插入。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过将物体移除解耦为几何移除和外观渲染两个阶段，并利用几何信息建模因果关系，该方法能够有效移除物体及其视觉伪影，同时保持编辑的可控性和真实性。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet是一个新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数自由的Hadamard乘法融合将基于transformer的表征与生理学基础的D-Marker特征直接集成，在笑容情感识别任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多任务学习框架在笑容情感识别中的计算效率低下问题，这些方法由于辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡需求而效率不高。

Method: 提出HadaSmileNet框架，系统评估了15种融合策略，发现Hadamard乘法融合能够实现直接特征交互同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得最先进结果：UvA-NEMO (88.7%, +0.8)、MMI (99.7%)、SPOS (98.5%, +0.7)和BBC (100%, +5.0)，参数减少26%且训练简化。

Conclusion: 该框架的效率和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用的实际部署。

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

*Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiajun Zhai,Shangwei Guo,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的联合人体-场景重建框架，能够在快速运动下从单目事件相机视频中重建动态人体和静态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在快速运动下会产生运动模糊，影响动态人体重建质量。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态场景重建。

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，通过可学习的语义属性区分人体和场景高斯。仅人体高斯进行形变动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，匹配连续渲染间的亮度变化与事件流，提高快速运动区域的局部保真度。

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur两个基准数据集上实现了最先进的人体-场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法，LPIPS指标降低，尤其对高速运动主体效果明显。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了高斯集合管理，有效解决了快速运动下的模糊问题，为动态人体与静态场景的联合重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Live-E2T是一个实时威胁监控框架，通过结构化语义元组、在线事件去重和基于LLM的推理机制，同时实现了实时性能和决策可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要一种能够统一这两个目标的新框架。

Method: 1. 将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2. 提出高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3. 使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明逻辑推理。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime等基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测准确性、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功解决了实时威胁监控中实时性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PhotoCritique数据集、PhotoEye模型和PhotoBench基准，旨在解决多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面的不足，特别是在专业摄影美学分析上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面存在显著差距，无法像专业摄影师那样进行深度的美学分析（如色彩、构图、光影等），而仅限于基本的物体识别和一般美学常识。

Method: 1）构建大规模专业摄影评论数据集PhotoCritique；2）提出PhotoEye模型，采用语言引导的多视角视觉融合机制；3）建立全面的美学视觉理解基准PhotoBench。

Result: 在现有基准和新提出的PhotoBench上，PhotoEye模型相比现有模型展现出明显优势。

Conclusion: 通过专业数据集、创新模型和全面基准的协同工作，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的美学视觉理解能力，填补了专业摄影美学分析的技术空白。

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Method: 利用XMem记忆增强架构，集成记忆机制在实时条件下分割肿瘤，特别适用于标注数据有限的情况。

Result: 由于实验记录丢失无法提供精确定量结果，但初步印象显示框架具有合理的分割性能并满足临床实时要求。

Conclusion: 该XMem框架为MRI引导放疗中的实时肿瘤分割提供了有前景的解决方案，有助于提升治疗精度。

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

TL;DR: 提出SSCM模型解决多对比度MRI超分辨率问题，通过动态空间扭曲、语义感知标记聚合和空间-频率融合模块，实现空间语义一致性重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在空间语义一致性建模不足，且未充分利用频域信息，导致细粒度对齐差和高频细节恢复不足

Method: SSCM模型包含三个核心模块：动态空间扭曲模块用于跨对比度空间对齐，语义感知标记聚合块实现长程语义一致性，空间-频率融合块用于精细结构恢复

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，SSCM以更少的参数实现了最先进的性能，确保了空间和语义一致的重建

Conclusion: SSCM模型有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的空间语义一致性问题，显著提升了重建质量

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-educated GRPO (OraPO)方法和FactScore-based奖励机制(FactS)，在有限预算下实现高效的放射学报告生成，显著减少训练数据需求和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法依赖大规模数据和复杂多阶段训练，计算成本高昂。需要开发在有限预算下仍能保持高性能的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 结合OraPO和FactS：OraPO通过轻量级oracle步骤将失败的GRPO探索转化为直接偏好监督，实现单阶段强化学习训练；FactS通过提取原子临床事实并与真实标签进行蕴含检查，提供密集可解释的句子级奖励。

Result: 在CheXpert Plus数据集上达到SOTA性能(F1=0.341)，训练数据减少2-3个数量级，仅使用小型基础视觉语言模型和普通硬件。

Conclusion: 提出的紧凑框架显著提高了临床挑战性病例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

TL;DR: AMSF是一个无需训练的参考式多风格融合框架，能够在扩散模型中实现可控的多参考风格融合，解决了现有方法只能处理单一风格和缺乏平衡机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考式方法存在两个主要限制：(a)只能接受一个风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b)缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制。

Method: 通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，自适应注入到冻结扩散模型的交叉注意力层中，然后通过相似度感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准对每个风格组件的注意力分配。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示AMSF在多风格融合结果上持续优于最先进方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两种或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF是朝着扩散模型中表达性多风格生成的实用步骤。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLF-4DRCNet是一个用于3D物体检测的两阶段框架，通过4D雷达和相机图像的多层次融合来解决雷达点云稀疏和噪声问题，在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR-相机融合设计的显式鸟瞰图融合范式，忽略了雷达点云的稀疏性和不完整性，仅进行粗粒度的场景级融合。

Method: 提出三模块框架：增强雷达点编码器(ERPE)模块通过三重注意力体素特征编码器将雷达点云与2D图像实例稠密化编码；分层场景融合池化(HSFP)模块使用可变形注意力动态整合多尺度体素特征与2D图像特征；提案级融合增强(PLFE)模块通过融合图像特征精炼区域提案。

Result: 在View-of-Delft和TJ4DRadSet数据集上实现最先进性能，在VoD数据集上达到与基于LiDAR模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MLF-4DRCNet通过点级、场景级和提案级的多层次融合，实现了4D雷达和相机图像的全面特征表示，有效解决了雷达点云稀疏性问题。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDLS是一种基于Rectified Flow模型的训练免费框架，通过双潜在空间引导解决扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题，在保持结构保真度的同时提升语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将图像编码为单个潜在向量时，难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建结果出现语义漂移（如细节模糊或属性错误）。

Method: PDLS将反演过程分解为两个互补流：结构路径保持源图像完整性，语义路径由提示词引导。通过最优控制问题建模，使用线性二次调节器（LQR）获得闭式解，动态引导生成轨迹。

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，PDLS在各种反演任务（高斯去模糊、运动去模糊、超分辨率和自由形式修复）中，比单潜在基线方法产生更忠实于原始图像且语义信息更对齐的重建结果。

Conclusion: PDLS框架通过双潜在空间引导有效解决了扩散模型图像反演中的语义漂移问题，无需昂贵的逐图像优化即可实现高质量重建。

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球MRI需求持续增长给医疗系统带来巨大压力，特别是在资源匮乏和农村地区。需要开发能够提高诊断效率、减轻医生负担的AI工具。

Method: 利用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，训练了基于22万多个MRI研究的视觉语言模型Prima，采用分层视觉架构提供通用可迁移的MRI特征。

Result: 在包含3万例MRI研究的1年系统测试中，Prima在主要神经系统疾病（肿瘤、炎症、感染、发育异常等）诊断中平均AUC达92.0%，优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模视觉语言模型的变革潜力，能够提供可解释的鉴别诊断、优化放射科医生工作流程，并在不同患者群体中保持算法公平性。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Method: 引入"图像编辑"作为桥梁，在推理过程中通过强大的理解能力来提供生成指导，逐步将理解注入生成过程

Result: 在TIIF基准测试的长提示设置上取得了3.92%的性能提升

Conclusion: UiG框架在文本到图像生成方面相比现有方法表现出显著的性能改进

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in

high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and

### [54] [LEAF-Mamba: Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion State Space Model for RGB-D Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18683)
*Lanhu Wu,Zilin Gao,Hao Fei,Mong-Li Lee,Wynne Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF-Mamba是一种用于RGB-D显著目标检测的新方法，通过结合状态空间模型（SSM）来解决现有方法在局部语义和跨模态融合方面的不足，实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著目标检测方法主要依赖CNN（受限于局部感受野）或Vision Transformers（二次复杂度成本高），难以平衡性能与计算效率。状态空间模型（Mamba）在建模长距离依赖方面具有线性复杂度的潜力，但直接应用于RGB-D SOD会导致局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分。

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含两个新组件：1）局部强调状态空间模块（LE-SSM）用于捕获多尺度局部依赖；2）基于SSM的自适应融合模块（AFM）用于互补的跨模态交互和可靠的跨模态集成。

Result: 在16个最先进的RGB-D SOD方法中，LEAF-Mamba在效能和效率方面均表现优异。此外，该方法在RGB-T SOD任务上也表现出色，证明了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba通过创新的局部强调和自适应融合机制，成功解决了RGB-D SOD中的局部语义不足和跨模态融合问题，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现了卓越的性能。

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

*Xinle Gao,Linghui Ye,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级食品图像分类算法，结合窗口多头注意力机制和空间注意力机制，在降低计算复杂度的同时保持高分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但Vision Transformer模型参数多、计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限环境中部署。

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制（WMHAM）和空间注意力机制（SAM），WMHAM通过窗口划分降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域。

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间取得了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSDA是一个三阶段框架，用于遥感图像中无标注的开放集土地覆盖发现、分割和描述，结合像素级精度和高级语义理解来解决开放世界遥感解释的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感中的开放集土地覆盖分析需要实现细粒度空间定位和语义开放分类，不仅要无类别监督地检测和分割新对象，还要通过多模态推理为其分配可解释的语义标签。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）使用可提示的微调分割模型（SAM）进行精确发现和掩码提取；2）通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行语义归因和上下文描述；3）使用LLM作为评判者和人工评分进行MLLM评估。

Result: 该框架支持在不同卫星图像上进行鲁棒评估，无需人工标注，为动态土地覆盖监测提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: OSDA在自动制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面显示出强大潜力，是一个架构无关且无标签的框架。

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前植物自动识别主要依赖北美和西欧的野外照片数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据稀缺。植物标本馆收藏了大量热带植物标本，可作为补充数据源。

Method: 采用跨域分类任务，训练集包含数十万份植物标本馆标本和数千张野外照片，测试集仅包含野外照片。数据集涵盖约1000种主要来自圭亚那地盾的植物物种。

Result: 挑战赛评估了利用植物标本馆数据改进热带地区植物识别的可行性，参与者开发了多种跨域分类方法。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆数据可以作为解决热带地区植物识别数据稀缺问题的重要补充资源，跨域学习方法在此任务中显示出潜力。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AGSwap的新方法，用于解决文本到图像生成中跨类别对象融合的问题，并引入了COF数据集作为基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法在融合不同类别对象时存在偏差、视觉混乱和语义不一致的问题，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap方法包含两个关键组件：组级嵌入交换（通过特征操作融合不同概念的语义属性）和自适应组更新（基于平衡评估分数的动态优化机制）。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下均优于现有的组合式文本到图像生成方法，包括GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的方法，能够生成连贯的跨类别对象融合图像，同时COF数据集为该领域的研究提供了重要的基准资源。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

TL;DR: RSVG-ZeroOV是一个无需训练的零样本开放词汇遥感视觉定位框架，利用冻结的基础模型实现开放世界的目标定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遥感视觉定位方法受限于封闭词汇集，以及依赖高质量数据集和耗时微调的问题

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1）使用视觉语言模型获取跨注意力图；2）利用扩散模型填补结构信息空白；3）通过注意力进化模块净化分割掩码

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架一致优于现有的弱监督和零样本方法

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案，无需繁琐的任务特定训练

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

### [61] [What Makes You Unique? Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715)
*Yingquan Wang,Pingping Zhang,Chong Sun,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种属性提示组合（APC）框架，通过文本语义增强对象重识别（ReID）的判别性和泛化能力，解决了现有模型在单域和跨域场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型要么局限于单域场景容易过拟合，要么在跨域场景中依赖归一化策略可能抑制身份特异性判别特征。需要一种能够同时增强判别性和泛化性的方法。

Method: 提出APC框架，包含属性提示生成器（APG）和快慢训练策略（FSTS）。APG通过语义属性字典和提示组合模块生成判别性属性感知特征；FSTS通过快速更新流和慢速更新流平衡ReID特异性判别和通用表示学习。

Result: 在传统和域泛化ReID数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在判别性和泛化性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过文本语义的有效利用，成功解决了ReID任务中判别性与泛化性的平衡问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The
source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最优传输的框架OTCCLIP，用于重建图像-文本对，以防御CLIP模型的数据投毒和后门攻击。该方法通过细粒度视觉和文本特征之间的最优传输距离重新分配标题，并利用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法仅依赖图像和标题的全局表示来纠正被投毒的图像-文本对，忽略了视觉和文本特征的细粒度特征，可能引入错误的图像-文本对并损害CLIP预训练。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的距离度量来衡量细粒度视觉和文本特征集之间的距离，并根据最优传输距离重新分配标题。同时采用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。

Result: 实验表明OTCCLIP能成功降低投毒攻击的攻击成功率，与先前方法相比，显著提高了在投毒数据集上训练的CLIP的零样本和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: OTCCLIP框架通过细粒度特征的最优传输对齐，有效防御CLIP模型的投毒攻击，同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

TL;DR: 提出LFI框架，通过显式建模视觉理解作为交互过程，解决视觉基础模型从视觉语言模型知识迁移的局限性，在多个基准测试中取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在从视觉语言模型迁移知识时存在根本性限制，主要采用结果导向范式而忽略了底层交互过程，这种表示差异阻碍了有效的知识迁移和跨视觉任务的泛化能力。

Method: LFI框架包含两个技术创新：交互查询（维护跨网络层的持久关系结构）和基于交互的监督（源自视觉语言模型的跨模态注意力机制）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得一致改进：TinyImageNet分类提升3.3和1.6mAP，COCO检测/分割提升2.4AP绝对增益，参数开销最小且收敛更快。在跨域设置中表现优异，PACS和VLCS零样本提升2.4和9.3。人类评估确认其认知对齐性，语义一致性指标比结果导向方法高2.7倍。

Conclusion: LFI框架通过建模预训练视觉语言模型中的动态交互模式，实现了更忠实和高效的知识迁移，特别在跨域场景中表现出色，具有更好的认知对齐性。

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，为多模态显著目标检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The
code and results of our method are available at:

Motivation: LiDAR点云易受噪声、遮挡和对抗性破坏影响，传统自编码器在真实世界挑战性条件下性能下降

Method: 通过多模态交叉注意力机制对齐文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构，学习鲁棒表示

Result: 在强对抗攻击和重度噪声下显著优于CNN自编码器，但在轻度扰动下提升有限

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架具有模型无关性，可与任何CNN点云自编码器集成进行联合表示学习

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Motivation: 现有视频LLM工具使用方法假设工具库固定，无法适应现实世界中工具数据持续演化和流式输入的环境。

Method: COLT方法包含可学习的工具代码本作为工具特定记忆系统，根据用户指令与工具特征的相似度动态选择相关工具，并使用VideoToolBench数据集进行指令调优。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

TL;DR: FixingGS是一种无需训练的3D高斯溅射增强方法，利用扩散模型解决稀疏视角下3D重建的伪影问题，确保多视角一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角下的3D高斯溅射重建存在视觉信息不足的问题，导致伪影持续存在，现有生成先验方法难以保证多视角一致性

Method: 提出蒸馏方法提供更准确、跨视角一致的扩散先验，结合自适应渐进增强方案优化欠约束区域的重建

Result: 实验表明FixingGS在视觉质量和重建性能上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: FixingGS通过有效利用扩散模型能力，成功解决了稀疏视角3DGS重建中的伪影和多视角一致性问题

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

*Xijun Wang,Junyun Huang,Rayyan Abdalla,Chengyuan Zhang,Ruiqi Xian,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种非均匀权重分离方法，基于高斯分位数将模型权重分为异常值（显著）和多个内点值（非显著）子集，采用显著性感知混合量化算法，在视觉语言模型中实现超低位宽（≤2位）量化，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的计算需求和内存需求巨大，限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用，需要解决计算需求与超低位宽权重精度之间的关键差距。

Method: 提出Bi-VLM方法，基于高斯分位数非均匀分离模型权重，分为异常值（显著）和多个内点值（非显著）子集；设计显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束。

Result: 在VLM的语言模型部分，Bi-VLM在视觉问答任务上比SOTA方法提升3%-47%；在整体VLM上提升4%-45%；量化模型中图像token存在90%-99%的冗余，可进一步剪枝提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM成功实现了超低位宽量化，显著提升了视觉语言模型的效率，同时发现了量化模型中存在大量token冗余，为进一步优化提供了方向。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

*Azad Singh,Deepak Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSSECT是一个自监督学习框架，通过多尺度向量量化在医学图像表示学习中引入离散表示瓶颈，抑制捷径学习，提高跨任务和跨领域的表示迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法依赖复杂架构、解剖学先验或精心调优的数据增强，限制了可扩展性和泛化性，且容易在解剖相似度高、病理细微的医学图像（如胸片）中出现捷径学习问题。

Method: 将多尺度向量量化集成到自监督学习流程中，施加离散表示瓶颈，约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，同时抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上表现优异，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签场景下具有高标签效率，在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DiSSECT框架通过离散表示瓶颈有效解决了医学图像自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，提高了表示的可迁移性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合热成像、深度学习和车联网通信的实时检测系统，用于减少鹿车碰撞事故。系统在热成像数据集上达到98.84%的平均精度，并在实地测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国每年发生约210万起鹿车碰撞事故，造成440人死亡、5.9万人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时导致鹿群数量下降。现有可见光摄像头在恶劣天气条件下检测效果不足60%。

Method: 使用热成像技术和深度学习算法，基于在北卡罗来纳州Mars Hill收集的12,000多张热成像鹿图像数据集进行训练和验证。当检测到高概率目标时，通过C-V2X通信设备向周围车辆和路边单元广播传感器数据。

Result: 系统性能优异：平均精度98.84%，精确率95.44%，召回率95.96%。在实地测试中，热成像在恶劣天气条件下保持88-92%的检测准确率，而传统可见光摄像头效果低于60%。端到端延迟始终低于100毫秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过热成像和车联网技术为减少鹿车碰撞事故提供了可行的技术路径，在各种天气条件下都能提供可靠的检测和预警功能。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了结构化反思方法，将错误修复路径转化为明确、可控、可训练的动作，通过Reflect-Call-Final策略优化工具调用，显著提升多轮工具调用的成功率和错误恢复能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强的大型语言模型通常使用监督模仿或粗粒度强化学习训练，自我反思实践依赖启发式提示或单向推理，在多轮交互中脆弱，模型经常重复同样的错误

Method: 结合DAPO和GSPO目标与针对工具使用的奖励方案，优化Reflect-Then-Call-Then-Final的逐步策略，并引入Tool-Reflection-Bench基准进行程序化评估

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench上的实验显示，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力大幅提升，冗余调用减少

Conclusion: 使反思明确化并直接优化，提高了工具交互的可靠性，为智能体从失败中学习提供了可复现的路径

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术数据标注稀缺限制了深度学习系统发展，传统扩散模型存在数据记忆化问题，导致样本不一致且可能损害下游性能

Method: 构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调使扩散模型生成过程与下游目标明确对齐

Result: 在三个手术数据集上，分类任务提升7-9%，分割任务提升2-10%，迭代细化进一步带来4-10%的性能提升

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Motivation: 当前视频基准主要关注室内场景或短距离户外活动，缺乏对长距离旅行挑战的探索，而掌握扩展的地理时空轨迹对于下一代MLLMs至关重要。

Method: 构建包含200个旅行视频的VIR-Bench基准，将行程重建作为评估任务，并开发原型旅行规划代理进行案例研究。

Result: 实验表明包括专有模型在内的最先进MLLMs都难以获得高分，突显了处理跨越大时空尺度视频的困难。

Conclusion: VIR-Bench不仅能有效评估模型性能，其评估协议还能转化为用户面向应用中的具体性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

Conclusion: 该方法可有效实现动态PET的高时间和空间分辨率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical

Conclusion: 提出的光流标签插值结合多任务学习框架有效解决了手术场景中的时空标注不平衡问题，为机器人辅助手术提供了更好的视觉理解支持。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViG模型依赖非参数化的统计方法构建图结构，无法为每个节点选择最优邻域，且需要超参数搜索。需要一种可学习的、无需超参数的图构建方法。

Method: LRGC方法在每对节点间应用键值注意力机制，然后使用软阈值重参数化进行边选择，通过可学习参数自动调整阈值，实现端到端的图构建训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k基准测试中，ViG-LRGC方法在相似模型大小下超越了当前最先进的ViG模型性能。

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种可学习的、无需超参数搜索的图构建方法，能够自适应地为每个节点选择最优邻域，显著提升了视觉图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出Point Prompt Defender框架，通过对抗性强化学习自动优化SAM的点提示，采用攻击-防御范式提升分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或手动设计的提示，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力，需要自动化的提示优化方案

Method: 构建双空间图表示图像块，使用DQN训练攻击者和防御者智能体，攻击者最大化破坏分割性能，防御者抑制干扰提示恢复精度

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升SAM的鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需重新训练即可增强各种任务的分割性能

Conclusion: Point Prompt Defender建立了灵活、可解释、即插即用的提示优化框架，为基于提示的分割提供了新思路

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSplat是首个无需Structure-from-Motion的基于事件相机的去模糊3D高斯泼溅方法，通过直接获取初始点云和引入事件流来实现高效去模糊渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中由于不准确的相机姿态导致的累积误差问题，以及利用事件相机对动态变化的高敏感性来提升去模糊效果。

Method: 1. 利用预训练的密集立体模块(DUSt3R)直接从模糊图像获取准确初始点云，避免相机姿态计算带来的误差；2. 引入事件流，通过解码潜在清晰图像为场景重建优化提供细粒度监督信号。

Result: 在多种场景下的实验表明，DeblurSplat不仅能生成高保真度的新视角图像，而且在去模糊3D-GS方面相比现有技术实现了显著的渲染效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了运动去模糊问题，通过结合事件相机和直接点云获取技术，在保持高质量渲染的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices
and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that
pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically

directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的频率感知音频-视觉分割(FAVS)框架，通过频率域分解和重构来解决音频-视觉分割任务中的模态间频率域矛盾问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有AVS方法忽视了音频和视觉模态在频率域上的固有矛盾——音频高频信号普遍存在干扰噪声，而视觉高频信号包含丰富的结构细节。忽略这些差异会导致性能次优。

Method: FAVS框架包含两个关键模块：频率域增强分解器(FDED)模块采用基于残差的迭代频率分解来区分模态特定语义和结构特征；协同跨模态一致性(SCMC)模块利用专家混合架构通过动态专家路由增强语义一致性和模态特定特征保留。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，FAVS框架实现了最先进的性能，丰富的定性可视化进一步验证了FDED和SCMC模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将AVS任务重新定义为频率域分解和重构问题，提出的FAVS框架有效解决了音频-视觉模态间的频率域矛盾，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AGSSP的新颖预训练范式，通过异常先验指导表示学习，解决了金属表面缺陷检测中预训练-微调范式的域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法面临两个关键问题：在自然图像数据集（如ImageNet）上预训练存在显著的域差距，而在工业数据上进行简单的自监督预训练又因现有学习目标无法区分细微缺陷模式与复杂背景噪声而效果不佳。

Method: AGSSP采用两阶段框架：首先通过从异常图中蒸馏知识来预训练模型骨干网络，鼓励网络捕获缺陷显著特征；然后使用从这些图中导出的伪缺陷框来预训练检测器，使其与定位任务对齐。还开发了知识增强方法来生成高质量异常图，并收集了12万张图像的大规模工业数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，AGSSP在各种设置下都能持续提升性能，与基于ImageNet的模型相比，mAP@0.5最高提升10%，mAP@0.5:0.95最高提升11.4%。

Conclusion: AGSSP通过异常先验指导的表示学习，有效解决了金属表面缺陷检测中的预训练困境，为工业缺陷检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Motivation: 现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在含镜面场景中性能下降，主要关注镜面表面的对称映射，但忽视了镜面反射携带的丰富信息，这些反射可以提供互补视角来填补缺失细节。

Method: 提出ReflectiveGS方法，基于3D高斯泼溅技术扩展，将镜面反射作为互补视角而非对称伪影，增强场景几何并恢复缺失细节。同时构建MirrorScene3D数据集作为基准。

Result: 在MirrorScene3D数据集上的实验表明，ReflectiveGS在SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS指标和训练速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReflectiveGS为含镜面环境中的3D重建设立了新基准，证明了利用镜面反射作为互补视角的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的胆道定位方法，通过Yolo检测算法和GAN生成合成训练数据，旨在提高腹腔镜胆囊切除术中胆管的可视化，减少胆管损伤风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜胆囊切除术虽然恢复快、美容效果好，但胆管损伤风险较高，严重影响患者生活质量和生存率。需要改进术中胆管可视化来避免此类损伤。

Method: 构建并标注图像数据库训练Yolo检测算法，采用经典数据增强技术和生成对抗网络(GAN)生成部分合成训练数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够有效定位胆道结构，但具体性能指标未在摘要中详细说明。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术可用于改善腹腔镜手术中的胆道可视化，但仍需进一步讨论伦理考量。

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt-DAS框架，利用多任务学习和提示机制实现电子显微镜图像中细胞器的领域自适应分割，支持无监督、弱监督和交互式分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模电子显微镜图像中细胞器实例分割的标注效率问题，利用SAM的提示机制但克服其需要为每个实例提供提示的限制。

Method: 构建可提示的多任务框架，结合辅助中心点检测任务和提示引导的对比学习，支持不同提示配置（全点、稀疏点、无点）。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，该方法在UDA、WDA和基于SAM的方法上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS框架为领域自适应分割提供了灵活高效的解决方案，显著提升了标注效率。

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言推理方法通常在粗粒度级别使用推理链，难以进行细粒度结构化推理，并且难以评估中间推理的质量和奖励。

Result: 在具有挑战性的视觉语言基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，建立了强大的基线。

Conclusion: 本文为视觉语言模型提供了基准，并为更复杂的多模态推理提供了见解，相关数据集、PRM和代码将开源。

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于SAM和ViT的弱监督食物图像语义分割方法，利用ViT的类激活图生成SAM提示，无需像素级标注即可实现食物分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用SAM的零样本能力和ViT的注意力机制，开发无需像素级标注的食物图像分割方法，以加速食物图像标注和营养跟踪应用

Method: 使用Swin Transformer生成类激活图作为SAM的提示，结合图像预处理技术和单掩码/多掩码生成策略，仅需图像级标注进行训练

Result: 在FoodSeg103数据集上评估，平均每张图像生成2.4个掩码（不包括背景），多掩码场景下mIoU达到0.54

Conclusion: 该方法可作为加速食物图像标注的工具，或集成到食物营养跟踪应用中，展示了弱监督分割在食物图像分析中的潜力

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的时序一致性U-Net分割架构，旨在实现超声心动图分割的时间稳定性和精确性，通过构建回声动态图和心脏相位动态注意力机制来解决帧间分割抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图容易受到变形和散斑噪声的影响，导致帧间分割抖动。即使单帧分割精度很高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计并影响临床解释性。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet框架，通过动态学习构建回声动态图提取视频动态信息，采用多个基于Swin-Transformer的编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，并在跳跃连接处引入心脏相位动态注意力机制，利用动态特征和心脏相位线索强制时序一致性。

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上的广泛实验表明，DyL-UNet在保持与现有方法相当的分割精度的同时，实现了更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian是一个高效的稀疏视图3D高斯重建框架，通过在小波域应用扩散模型来显著减少计算开销，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在稀疏视图设置下性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复渲染结果但计算成本高昂。

Method: 将扩散过程转移到小波域：仅在低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量级网络细化；提出高效的在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D两个基准数据集上，WaveletGaussian实现了竞争性的渲染质量，同时大幅减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian通过小波域扩散和高效训练策略，在稀疏视图3D重建中实现了计算效率和渲染质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

TL;DR: Sa2VA-i是对Sa2VA模型的改进版本，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性，显著提升了在视频对象分割任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现Sa2VA模型在视频对象分割任务中未能发挥其全部潜力，主要原因是训练和推理过程存在不一致性。

Method: 提出Sa2VA-i模型，通过修正训练和推理过程中的不一致性问题来改进原Sa2VA模型。

Result: Sa2VA-i在多个视频基准测试中创造了新的最先进结果：MeViS提升+11.6 J&F，Ref-YT-VOS提升+1.4，Ref-DAVIS提升+3.3，ReVOS提升+4.1。Sa2VA-i-1B模型在MeViS基准上甚至能与原Sa2VA-26B模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了看似微不足道的实现细节的重要性，为视频分割领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱遥感图像分析需要专门训练模型的高成本问题，以及通用多模态模型无法处理多光谱信号的限制。

Method: 利用多模态模型对视觉空间的理解，将多光谱数据适配到该空间，并将领域特定信息作为指令注入模型，以Gemini2.5模型为例进行验证。

Conclusion: 该方法使地理空间专业人员能够轻松利用强大的多模态模型处理专业传感器数据，加速工作流程并受益于模型的丰富推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型在零样本条件下检测和描述交通事故的能力，使用基础设施摄像头图像，通过集成视觉分析技术提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故检测对公共安全至关重要，基础设施视觉传感器提供了可扩展的实时监控方案，但缺乏多样化的标注数据集限制了传统方法的应用。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟的DeepAccident数据集，比较Gemini 1.5/2.0、Gemma 3和Pixtral模型的零样本性能，并集成YOLO、Deep SORT和SAM等视觉分析技术来增强提示效果。

Result: Pixtral表现最佳（F1分数0.71，召回率83%），Gemini模型通过增强提示提高了精度（如Gemini 1.5达90%）但F1和召回率下降，Gemma 3性能最平衡。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与先进视觉分析技术结合具有巨大潜力，可提升现实世界自动化交通监控系统的适用性。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，需要在视频帧间实现一致的点识别，特别是在外观变化、运动和遮挡的情况下，针对在线实时应用场景

Method: 扩展Track-On模型为Track-On2，采用基于Transformer的因果处理架构，通过内存机制保持时间一致性，使用粗粒度补丁分类和细化策略，并系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中取得最先进结果，超越先前的在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的强离线方法

Conclusion: 基于因果、内存架构的模型纯粹在合成数据上训练，可作为现实世界点跟踪的可扩展有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort
seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset
processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced
later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN在边缘设备上部署时面临的高延迟、高能耗问题，以及边缘-云协同推理系统中的高传输成本挑战。

Method: 引入学习型脉冲驱动压缩模块减少数据传输，采用动态提前退出机制基于输出置信度自适应终止推理，在真实边缘-云测试平台上基于ResNet-18和VGG-16骨干网络进行原型验证。

Result: 数据传输减少高达2048倍，边缘能耗降低超过90%，端到端延迟相比纯边缘推理降低3倍，精度损失小于2%。

Conclusion: NeuCODEX能够在资源受限环境中实现实用、高性能的SNN部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 通过引入鲁棒先验和场景对应学习，成功提升了自监督立体匹配在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出YOLO-LAN，一种基于YOLO的息肉检测管道，通过M2IoU损失、数据增强和负样本训练，在结肠镜息肉检测中表现出色，在两个数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是一种致命疾病，始于结肠内壁息肉的形成。结肠镜检查是检测息肉的标准方法，但人工检测存在不一致性和漏检问题。基于深度学习的对象检测可以提供更准确、实时的诊断解决方案。

Method: 提出YOLO-LAN息肉检测管道，使用M2IoU损失函数、多种数据增强技术和负样本训练，以模拟真实临床情况。基于YOLOv12和YOLOv8架构进行训练。

Result: 在Kvasir-seg数据集上，YOLOv12达到mAP50为0.9619，mAP50:95为0.8599；YOLOv8达到mAP50为0.9540，mAP50:95为0.8487。在BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp数据集上也表现出色。mAP50:95分数的显著提升显示了息肉检测的精确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性，使其在AI辅助结直肠筛查中具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Abstract: This technical report explores the MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge, which
targets complex semi-supervised video object segmentation. By analysing and
adapting SeC, an enhanced SAM-2 framework, we conduct a detailed study of its
long-term memory and concept-aware memory, showing that long-term memory
preserves temporal continuity under occlusion and reappearance, while
concept-aware memory supplies semantic priors that suppress distractors;
together, these traits directly benefit several MOSEv2's core challenges. Our
solution achieves a JF score of 39.89% on the test set, ranking 1st in the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视觉处理机制，基于人类视觉的双流假说，将视觉处理分解为物体识别和空间感知两个部分进行研究，并提出了改进模型效率和空间推理能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，与人类视觉的并行处理方式存在差异，且其内部机制不透明，阻碍了深入理解和架构创新。

Method: 将视觉处理分解为物体识别和空间感知：对于物体识别，将图像转换为文本标记图，分析模型从浅层到深层的两阶段处理过程；对于空间感知，理论推导和实证验证VLMs中位置表示的几何结构。基于这些发现，提出了基于即插即用视觉解码器的指令无关标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 验证了VLMs中视觉处理的两阶段机制和位置表示的几何结构，提出的方法有效提高了解码效率和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究为理解VLM内部机制提供了深入见解，并为设计更强大的未来架构提供了明确原则。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无视觉编码器的检索方法，通过VLLM生成结构化图像描述，将文本到图像检索转换为文本到文本检索，解决了传统视觉语言模型的语言理解浅层、模态鸿沟和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）存在语言理解浅层、模态鸿沟问题，且依赖大量网络数据训练带来计算成本和隐私担忧。

Method: 采用无视觉编码器的单编码器检索管道，利用VLLM生成结构化图像描述，将检索任务从文本-图像转换为文本-文本范式。

Result: 该方法显著减少了模态鸿沟，提升了组合性，在短长标题查询上表现更好，仅需几小时GPU校准即可实现，且在小至0.3B参数模型上达到SOTA零样本性能。

Conclusion: 无视觉检索器在多个基准测试中匹配甚至超越传统多模态模型，提供更隐私友好的替代方案，并发布了新的组合性基准subFlickr和subCOCO。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比视觉语言模型（VLMs）中组合性与长标题理解之间的双向关系，发现两者可以相互促进，但训练效果受数据质量和模型设计影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对比视觉语言模型在视觉和文本信息绑定方面取得了显著进展，但理解长而密集的标题仍然是一个开放挑战。作者假设组合性（即推理对象-属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，研究这两种能力之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究发现组合性训练能提高长标题检索性能，而长标题训练也能促进组合性。但这些收益对数据质量和模型设计敏感，低质量数据或有限参数更新会限制泛化能力。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、有基础的描述上进行训练来共同学习。高质量的长标题数据训练可以使模型在这两个任务上都表现出色。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

<details>

Motivation: 热图像中植物分割在户外高通量表型分析中面临挑战，主要是植物与杂草对比度低和频繁遮挡导致性能不佳

Method: 使用1,128张合成图像训练模型生成作物和杂草分割掩码，结合少量真实标注图像，利用CycleGAN-turbo进行RGB到热图像的跨模态对齐

Result: 结合所有合成图像和少量真实标注图像，相比全真实数据基线，杂草类相对改进22%，植物类相对改进17%

Conclusion: 通过合成数据、有限手动标注和生成模型的跨域翻译相结合，可以显著提升复杂田间环境中多模态图像的语义分割性能

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多尺度特征交互网络(MsFIN)，用于从行车记录仪视频中进行早期事故预测，通过多尺度特征聚合、时序特征处理和多尺度特征后融合来解决交通参与者特征交互建模和复杂多时序行为线索捕获的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着行车记录仪的广泛部署和计算机视觉技术的发展，从行车记录仪视角开发事故预测模型对于主动安全干预变得至关重要。但存在两个关键挑战：交通参与者特征级交互建模（在行车记录仪视图中常被遮挡）和捕捉事故前复杂异步多时序行为线索。

Method: 提出MsFIN网络，包含三个层次：多尺度特征聚合层（设计多尺度模块提取短期、中期和长期时序尺度的场景表示，利用Transformer架构促进全面特征交互）、时序特征处理层（在因果约束下捕捉场景和对象特征的序列演化）、多尺度特征后融合层（融合多个时序尺度的场景和对象特征生成全面风险表示）。

Result: 在DAD和DADA数据集上的实验表明，MsFIN在预测准确性和及时性方面显著优于采用单尺度特征提取的最先进模型。消融研究验证了MsFIN中每个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MsFIN通过多尺度特征融合和上下文交互建模实现了优越性能，为行车记录仪视角的早期事故预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Conclusion: 将人脸伪造检测构建为持续学习问题，并通过混合专家架构成功解决了模型适应性和遗忘问题。

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Motivation: 人类能够从多个角度比较视频相似性，但现有模型依赖全局相似度评分，缺乏细粒度的概念级比较能力。大型多模态模型的出现为利用自然语言进行视频比较任务提供了新机会。

Method: 引入ConViS任务，通过预定义语义概念计算视频对的相似度得分；构建ConViS-Bench基准数据集，包含精心标注的视频对，每个对都有概念级相似度评分和文本描述；对多个先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: 不同模型在ConViS任务上表现出显著性能差异，某些概念对视频相似度估计更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ConViS-Bench将成为推动语言驱动视频理解研究的重要资源，实现了类似人类的视频相似性推理能力。

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是首个仅使用第一人称视角视觉来感知环境和导航的人类化身系统，通过将低级运动技能学习与高级视觉控制解耦，实现了更接近人类行为的运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类运动生成方法忽视了感知与运动之间的相互依赖关系，使用的感知方式与人类差异很大。作者认为生成类人化身行为需要类人感知。

Method: 1. 在大型运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型；2. 使用Q-learning训练策略，将第一人称视角视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验表明第一人称视角视觉可以产生类人运动特征，例如化身能够避开视野中的障碍物行走。

Conclusion: 为化身配备类人传感器（特别是第一人称视角视觉）有望训练出行为更像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法在处理边界框显著重叠时表现不佳，特别是大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例。现有基准偏向简单案例，无法有效评估模型在挑战性条件下的性能。

Method: 1) 提出OverLayScore指标量化边界框重叠复杂度；2) 构建OverLayBench基准，包含高质量标注和平衡的OverLayScore分布；3) 开发CreatiLayout-AM模型，在模态掩码数据集上进行微调。

Result: 分析显示现有基准存在偏向低OverLayScore值的偏差。提出的OverLayBench提供了更全面的评估框架，CreatiLayout-AM模型在复杂重叠场景下表现出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实和挑战性场景下实现更稳健的布局到图像生成奠定了基础，通过新指标、基准和改进模型解决了重叠边界框的关键问题。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolSplat提出了一种新的多视图前馈3D高斯溅射范式，用体素对齐的高斯分布替代像素对齐方法，解决了现有方法对输入视图数量的依赖、视角偏差密度分布和对齐误差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素对齐的高斯预测方法存在三个主要限制：重建的3D模型严重依赖输入视图数量、导致视角偏差密度分布、在源视图存在遮挡或低纹理时引入对齐误差。

Method: VolSplat通过从预测的3D体素网格直接预测高斯分布，替代了基于2D特征匹配的像素对齐方法，实现了多视图一致性，并能根据3D场景复杂度自适应控制高斯密度。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ScanNet等基准测试中，VolSplat实现了最先进的性能，产生更合理和视角一致的高斯重建，渲染质量得到提升。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅取得了优越的结果，还为前馈3D重建建立了一个更可扩展的框架，提供了更密集和鲁棒的表示，为更广泛社区的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

TL;DR: CAR-Flow是一种条件感知重参数化方法，通过轻量级学习偏移来调节源分布和目标分布，缩短概率路径，加速训练并提升条件生成模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散和流匹配方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，增加了模型负担。CAR-Flow旨在通过重新定位分布来简化学习任务

Method: 提出条件感知重参数化流匹配(CAR-Flow)，通过学习轻量级偏移来调节源分布、目标分布或两者，缩短概率路径长度

Result: 在低维合成数据上可视化并量化CAR效果；在ImageNet-256上，SiT-XL/2结合CAR-Flow将FID从2.07降至1.68，仅增加不到0.6%参数

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过简单有效的分布重定位策略，显著提升条件生成模型性能，证明缩短概率路径是优化流匹配方法的有效途径

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种统一的多任务学习框架，通过动态提示调度机制解决大语言模型在多任务和跨域设置中的泛化限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SPoT依赖固定提示模板，存在泛化能力不足的问题，需要开发更灵活的多任务学习框架来提升模型跨任务和跨域的适应能力。

Method: 引入提示池和任务感知调度策略，动态组合和对齐不同任务的提示；使用任务嵌入和门控机制精细控制提示信号；采用联合多任务学习优化目标，包含调度权重的自动学习策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，提示调度方法在一系列语言理解和知识推理任务上显著提升性能，有效维持模型稳定性并增强可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法在统一多任务建模和跨域适应方面展现出良好的适用性和有效性，为解决多任务学习中的任务干扰和负迁移问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in
large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior
methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study
introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt
scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling
strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different
tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across
tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating
mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between
prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible
sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective
centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning
strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference
and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of
sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact
of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm
the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and
enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt
scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language
understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate
its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and
cross-domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估缺乏对数学能力的细粒度分析，需要构建能够揭示模型底层数学智能的全面评估框架。

Method: 设计GAUSS基准测试，将数学问题按认知技能分类，设计隔离特定能力的任务，构建多维技能评估体系。

Result: 通过GAUSS基准测试获得了GPT-5-thinking的技能画像，揭示了其优势、劣势以及与o4-mini-high的差异。

Conclusion: 多维度的基于技能的评估方法能够更准确地反映LLMs的数学智能，为模型能力分析提供有价值的信息。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of
\textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a
benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem
solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing
problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate
specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and
interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles
faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of
\textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its
differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value
of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rubin因果模型的事件因果关系识别方法，通过将第一个事件视为治疗、第二个事件视为结果，利用合成控制方法生成虚拟双胞胎来估计因果关系，在COPES-hard基准测试中表现优于包括GPT-4在内的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的事件因果关系识别方法主要依赖语言模式和多跳关系推理，容易因因果关系的非正式使用和虚假的图推理而导致错误识别。需要更稳健的方法来区分因果关系和相关关系。

Method: 采用Rubin因果模型框架，将时间上先发生的事件视为治疗，后发生的事件视为结果。由于无法在文本领域实际实施干预，使用合成控制方法从相关历史数据中生成虚拟双胞胎，利用文本嵌入合成和反演技术来估计因果效应。

Result: 该方法在因果关系基准测试COPES-hard上表现出色，识别效果优于包括GPT-4在内的现有方法，能够更稳健地识别事件间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 基于Rubin因果模型的合成控制方法为文本领域的事件因果关系识别提供了更可靠的框架，通过概念化干预和虚拟对照组的构建，有效解决了传统方法中虚假因果关系识别的问题。

Abstract: Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal
relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation
from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized
linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality
identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical
inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event
causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the
treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their
causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant
change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to
implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we
try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should
have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but
undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of
locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the
synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical
data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This
approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous
methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark,
COPES-hard.

TL;DR: ZERA是一种自动提示优化框架，通过联合优化系统提示和用户提示，使用结构化评分标准和低开销迭代，快速收敛到高质量提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法通常只关注用户提示，依赖非结构化反馈，需要大量样本和长迭代周期，导致成本高且脆弱。

Method: ZERA使用八个可泛化标准对提示进行评分，并基于结构化批评修订提示，通过最小样本和短迭代周期实现快速收敛。

Result: 在五个LLM和九个多样化数据集上的实验结果显示，ZERA相比强基线方法有持续改进，消融研究验证了各组件对提示构建的有效贡献。

Conclusion: ZERA提供了一种高效、低成本的提示优化方法，能够显著提升LLM在各种任务上的性能。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM)
performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods
typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and
require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and
brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a
novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through
principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight
generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts
based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to
high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We
evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning,
summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt
construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLMs经常被增强以获取外部信息，但这些信息可能是有帮助的、无关的甚至是误导性的。论文旨在系统研究这类辅助信息对LLMs推理过程的因果影响。

Method: 引入了SciAux数据集（基于ScienceQA），用于系统测试模型对不同类型信息的鲁棒性，特别关注具有逐步思考能力的模型。

Result: 研究发现模型的思考模式会放大误导性信息的负面影响，导致性能灾难性下降，而不是提供鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 关键挑战不仅在于让模型"思考"，更重要的是赋予它们评估推理所依赖信息的批判能力。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to
their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be
helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal
impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with
explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset
derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model
against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical
vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged
sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a
catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process.
Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when
provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely
to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate
the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux.

TL;DR: 提出了一种过程监督的多智能体框架来优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统中检索器与生成器之间的协调问题，通过决策制定器和知识选择器两个轻量级智能体，结合过程级奖励和树状展开策略，提升问答任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统中，检索器和生成器通常是独立开发的，导致两者交互不协调：检索器可能返回不相关或冗余的文档，而生成器未能充分利用检索到的证据。

Method: 采用过程监督的多智能体框架，包含决策制定器（决定何时继续检索或停止生成答案）和知识选择器（过滤检索到的文档保留最有用的证据）。使用LLM作为评判者提供过程级奖励，采用树状展开策略探索多样推理路径，并使用PPO进行端到端训练。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，该方法相比标准RAG基线实现了更高的准确性、更稳定的收敛性，并产生了更可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架是模块化和即插即用的，无需修改检索器或生成器，适用于实际的RAG应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the
coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components
are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the
retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may
fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a
process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever
and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision
Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer
generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to
retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we
employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with
process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying
solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout
strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on
single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach
achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more
interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines.
Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no
modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world
RAG applications.

Method: ERFC架构考虑多模态、情感的不同属性、上下文以及对话中说话者话语的相互依赖关系

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上的密集实验证明了ERFC的可行性

Conclusion: 该方法在呼叫中心等客户满意度至关重要的应用中具有巨大的商业价值

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation has been seen to be widely applicable in
call center analytics, opinion mining, finance, retail, healthcare, and other
industries. In a call center scenario, the role of the call center agent is not
just confined to receiving calls but to also provide good customer experience
by pacifying the frustration or anger of the customers. This can be achieved by
maintaining neutral and positive emotion from the agent. As in any
conversation, the emotion of one speaker is usually dependent on the emotion of
other speaker. Hence the positive emotion of an agent, accompanied with the
right resolution will help in enhancing customer experience. This can change an
unhappy customer to a happy one. Imparting the right resolution at right time
becomes easier if the agent has the insight of the emotion of future
utterances. To predict the emotions of the future utterances we propose a novel
architecture, Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation. Our proposed
ERFC architecture considers multi modalities, different attributes of emotion,
context and the interdependencies of the utterances of the speakers in the
conversation. Our intensive experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset have shown the
feasibility of the proposed ERFC. This approach can provide a tremendous
business value for the applications like call center, where the happiness of
customer is utmost important.

we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content,
specifically leveraging in-context definition as a policy guideline. We explore
various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT.
Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, increasing performance across
all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or
reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5.
Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic

long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study
the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple
responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align
with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the
outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it
is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is
not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can
make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable
rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores
branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that
converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes
\emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes.
Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated
\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a
critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO
with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.
At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO
reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit
without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,
TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and
out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and
reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

*Saksham Khatwani,He Cheng,Majid Afshar,Dmitriy Dligach,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索了将大语言模型作为知识图谱推理路径的奖励模型，用于医疗诊断推理，通过验证推理路径而非生成路径来提升诊断可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过检索增强生成或微调将知识图谱内容插入提示中，但缺乏结构化推理能力。受医生诊断评估过程启发，验证解决方案比从头生成更容易。

Method: 将LLM作为知识图谱推理路径的奖励模型，系统评估五种任务制定和八种训练范式，测试路径判断能力是否能泛化到下游诊断任务。

Result: 实验显示特定奖励优化和蒸馏能带来强大的路径判断性能，但向下游任务的可迁移性仍然较弱。

Conclusion: 这是对临床知识图谱进行"奖励模型风格"推理的首次系统评估，为基于奖励的监督如何影响医疗GenAI系统的诊断推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often
lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical
knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically
integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG
content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an
alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,
where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct
diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work
that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and
grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is
often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'
diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and
intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first
systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and
eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities
generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization
and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source
instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward
optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the
transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first
systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs,
offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences
diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

TL;DR: SubSpec是一种即插即用的无损训练自由方法，通过构建高度对齐的草稿模型来加速参数卸载，在有限显存下实现显著推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在消费级GPU上部署时的内存限制问题，传统压缩方法会降低质量，而参数卸载方法推理速度慢。

Method: 通过生成目标LLM卸载部分的低比特量化替代层来构建高度对齐的草稿模型，共享GPU驻留层和KV-Cache以减少内存开销和增强对齐。

Result: 在8GB显存限制下为Qwen2.5 7B实现9.1倍加速，在24GB显存限制下为Qwen2.5 32B平均实现12.5倍加速。

Conclusion: SubSpec方法有效解决了参数卸载的推理速度问题，实现了高质量无损加速。

Abstract: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment
on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter
offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can
degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow
inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate
parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft
tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single
forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward
passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on
pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align
with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model
training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from
insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token
acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,
we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading
that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft
model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target
LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers
and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.
SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for
Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for
Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种不依赖文本转录的语音文档对齐方法，提高语音到语音翻译的质量和效率。

Method: 使用单调对齐语音段嵌入的方法，不依赖文本转录，应用于3000小时的未标记并行英语-德语语音文档。

Result: 产生了约1000小时的高质量对齐数据，英语到德语和德语到英语的翻译性能分别比Global Mining提高了0.37和0.18 ASR-BLEU，且使用8倍少的原始语音文档就能达到或超过SpeechMatrix模型的性能。

Conclusion: Speech Vecalign是一种有效的语音文档对齐方法，能够在不依赖文本转录的情况下提高语音到语音翻译的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present Speech Vecalign, a parallel speech document alignment method that
monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings and does not depend on text
transcriptions. Compared to the baseline method Global Mining, a variant of
speech mining, Speech Vecalign produces longer speech-to-speech alignments. It
also demonstrates greater robustness than Local Mining, another speech mining
variant, as it produces less noise. We applied Speech Vecalign to 3,000 hours
of unlabeled parallel English-German (En-De) speech documents from VoxPopuli,
yielding about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments. We then trained En-De
speech-to-speech translation models on the aligned data. Speech Vecalign
improves the En-to-De and De-to-En performance over Global Mining by 0.37 and
0.18 ASR-BLEU, respectively. Moreover, our models match or outperform
SpeechMatrix model performance, despite using 8 times fewer raw speech
documents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种LLM辅助的说话人日志校正系统，通过实时用户反馈来修正说话人归属错误，显著降低了说话人日志错误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数自动语音处理系统在无用户反馈的"开环"模式下运行，而人机交互工作流可以显著提高准确性

Method: 系统执行流式ASR和说话人日志，使用LLM生成简洁摘要，接受简短语音反馈并立即整合。开发了SWM技术检测和分割多说话人段，以及基于用户校正的在线说话人注册

Result: 在AMI测试集上的LLM驱动模拟显示，系统显著降低DER 9.92%，说话人混淆错误降低44.23%

Conclusion: 该系统通过实时用户反馈和在线说话人注册，有效提升了说话人日志的准确性

Abstract: Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without
user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can
potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker
diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in
real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to
deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that
is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we
develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a
split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments
that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online
speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus
helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future.
LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system
substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We
further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary
vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and
correction frequency.

Motivation: 社会规范对对话系统的社会可接受性至关重要，现有方法主要关注静态规范分类，缺乏对规范违反后对话动态的建模，且在低资源语言中语用一致性不足。

Method: 提出V2R对话类型建模规范违反到解决的进展；采用基于范例的迭代细化方法在对话合成早期提升语用一致性；构建包含10,800个多轮对话的数据集，标注规范遵守、说话者意图和情感响应。

Result: 人工和LLM评估显示NormGenesis在细化质量、对话自然度和泛化性能上显著优于现有数据集；使用V2R增强数据训练的模型在伦理敏感语境中表现出更好的语用能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为文化自适应对话建模建立了新基准，提供了跨语言和文化的规范感知生成的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication,
enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but
also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for
generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,
and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm
classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution
(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations
through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic
consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based
iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design
introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations
before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a
dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm
adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based
evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing
datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization
performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit
improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and
provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically
and culturally diverse languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于英语文学创作，缺乏对非英语文学传统（如波斯文学）的系统评估，且缺乏标准化的创造力评估方法。

Method: 构建包含20个主题的波斯文学数据集，采用托兰斯创造力测试的四个维度（原创性、流畅性、灵活性和精细性）进行评估，使用LLM作为自动化评分工具并与人工评分进行相关性验证。

Result: 自动化评分与人工评分具有强一致性，模型在理解和运用四种核心文学修辞手法（明喻、隐喻、夸张、对偶）方面表现出优势与局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs在波斯文学文本生成方面具有潜力，但仍需进一步改进，特别是在文化相关表达和创造力方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in
generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior
research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of
non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing
creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian
literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset
of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model
outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and
elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce
evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate
its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation
coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models'
ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor,
hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need
for further refinement.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于语言建模和对话对齐(CA)分数的自动化方法来测量医患共同决策(SDM)，通过深度学习模型和微调的BERT模型分析42,559句对话，发现CA分数与SDM结果显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动测量医患共同决策(SDM)的方法，需要开发可扩展的自动化评估工具来促进以患者为中心的护理。

Method: 使用157个视频记录的医患对话，转录为42,559个句子，通过上下文-响应对和负采样训练深度学习模型和微调BERT模型，计算四种CA分数，并与SDM结果进行关联分析。

Result: DL模型和微调BERTbase模型分别达到0.227和0.640的recall@1，CA分数与OPTION12和DCS评分显著相关，表明CA分数可以有效测量SDM。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出了通过可解释的CA分数自动测量医患共同决策的可扩展方法，具有大规模评估SDM策略的潜力。

Abstract: Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care.
Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This
study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language
modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157
video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre
trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations
were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs
and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and
fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each
top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A
random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial
arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the
Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in
Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,
mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients
(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1
of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1
with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)
scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.
The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated
with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an
impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an
automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations
through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at
scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文推理基准往往模糊了关键因素（如任务内在复杂性、干扰因素影响、任务长度），无法进行精确的失败分析。

Method: 基于认知负荷理论设计自然语言逻辑谜题，通过独立调节内在难度(d)、干扰信号比(ρ)和任务长度(N)三个参数来系统控制认知负荷维度。

Result: 评估22个先进推理LLM发现：任务长度是主要约束因素，模型对内在复杂性有不同容忍度，对干扰比呈现U型响应。

Conclusion: CogniLoad通过系统控制认知负荷维度，为分析LLM推理局限性和指导未来模型开发提供了可重复、可扩展且诊断性强的工具。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)
often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor
interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we
introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load
Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with
independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic
difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$)
regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy
for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs,
CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length
as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic
complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic,
factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a
reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM
reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

Motivation: transformer架构虽然性能优异，但其序列长度的二次计算复杂度成为延迟敏感长上下文应用的瓶颈，而从头训练线性复杂度替代方案资源消耗大

Method: LAWCAT结合因果Conv1D层增强局部依赖建模，使用归一化门控线性注意力提高不同上下文长度的泛化能力，通过知识蒸馏将预训练transformer能力转移到线性架构

Result: 仅用1K长度序列蒸馏Mistral-7B，在22K tokens内实现超过90%的passkey检索准确率；Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT变体在多个长上下文基准测试中表现优异，预训练token需求不到0.1%；在超过8K tokens序列上预填充速度优于FlashAttention-2

Conclusion: LAWCAT为高性能长上下文线性模型提供了高效路径，适合边缘部署，减少了对大量长序列训练数据和计算资源的依赖

Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect
to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for
latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity
alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch
is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT
(Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization
framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained
transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates
causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs
normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying
context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling
Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval
accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context
window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance
on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark
(QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training
tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster
prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT
thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear
models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive
long-sequence training data and computational resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph
machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like
fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest,
the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their
interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled
evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the
strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based
applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing
prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,
web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting
homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both
short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM
sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by
methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to
quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable
guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance
on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs
where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction
strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption
that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is
able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to
leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a
comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph
interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to
conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual
transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat
transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic
script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune
ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We
adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset
before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from
English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve
high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed
model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process

Motivation: ChatGPT的广泛使用引发了对AI生成文本滥用的担忧，现有词汇级检测器容易受到改写攻击，存在ChatGPT词汇模式偏见，对修改文本检测性能下降，且需要大模型或在线LLM交互。

Method: 提出基于文本内部结构分类的轻量级框架，使用预训练语言模型编码句子嵌入，通过注意力建模关系，采用对比学习减轻自回归生成带来的嵌入偏见，结合因果图和反事实方法分离结构特征与主题相关偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测原始和经提示修改的AI生成文本，解决了现有检测器的局限性，为AI文本检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse,
highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current
word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP),
suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training
data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or
online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to
detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a
lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure,
which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence
embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via
attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from
autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual
methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments
on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs,
validate the effectiveness of our method.

Method: CCQA方法基于循环一致性原理：从每个推理路径和答案生成问题，评估生成问题与原问题的相似度，选择相似度最高的候选答案作为最终响应。使用专门的Flan-T5模型进行问题生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，CCQA在数学和常识推理基准测试中，在八个模型上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CCQA为SLMs建立了新的高效推理实用基准，证明了该方法在小型模型上的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the
accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller
models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches
often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose
\textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering
(CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs.
Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning
path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and
then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the
final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions
from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5
model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently.
From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on
mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method
establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source

*Yeongbin Seo,Gayoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于先验的数据过滤方法，使用语料库级别的词频统计来估计标记先验，作为困惑度(PPL)过滤的快速替代方案，无需模型推理即可实现高效数据筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于困惑度的数据过滤方法存在时间成本高、对噪声或分布外样本不可靠的问题，需要一种更高效可靠的替代方案来优化大语言模型的预训练数据选择。

Method: 基于语料库词频统计计算标记先验，通过标记先验的均值和标准差来过滤文档，该方法受到语言学中词角色和词汇密度研究的启发。

Result: 在20个下游基准测试中取得了最高平均性能，同时相比PPL过滤方法将时间成本降低了1000倍以上，并证明了对代码、数学等符号语言以及多语言语料库的适用性。

Conclusion: 基于先验的过滤方法是一种简单但强大的数据筛选技术，能够显著提高大语言模型预训练的数据选择效率，同时保持甚至超越传统方法的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora,
careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient
learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance,
it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of
the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we
propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method
that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics,
inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach
filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors,
serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its
simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance
across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x
compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to
symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to
multilingual corpora without supervision

TL;DR: TsqLoRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过数据质量驱动选择和敏感度感知的低秩适应来提高微调效率，同时保持或提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全微调所有模型参数计算成本高且内存密集，现有参数高效微调方法忽视了不同模型层的敏感度差异和训练数据的重要性。

Method: TsqLoRA包含两个主要组件：质量感知采样机制选择最有信息的训练数据，以及动态秩分配模块根据每层对参数更新的敏感度调整其秩。

Result: 实验结果表明TsqLoRA在各种NLP任务上提高了微调效率，同时保持甚至改善了性能。

Conclusion: TsqLoRA通过结合数据质量选择和敏感度感知的低秩适应，提供了一种有效的参数高效微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for downstream tasks has become a
fundamental approach in natural language processing. Fully fine-tuning all
model parameters is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially
in resource-constrained environments. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods reduce the number of trainable parameters but typically overlook the
varying sensitivity of different model layers and the importance of training
data. In this work, we propose TsqLoRA, a novel method that integrates
data-quality-driven selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation,
consisted of two main components: a quality-aware sampling mechanism for
selecting the most informative training data, and a dynamic rank allocation
module that adjusts the rank of each layer based on its sensitivity to
parameter updates. The experimental results demonstrate that TsqLoRA improves
fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance on a
variety of NLP tasks. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: UniECG是首个能够同时执行基于证据的心电图解释和文本条件心电图生成任务的统一模型，通过解耦的两阶段训练方法实现心电图与文本的双向转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一模型（如GPT-5）在视觉语言任务上取得了进展，但无法正确理解心电图信号并提供准确的医疗诊断，也不能生成心电图信号。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段训练方法：首先学习基于证据的解释技能（ECG-to-Text），然后通过潜在空间对齐注入心电图生成能力（Text-to-ECG）。

Result: UniECG能够根据用户输入自主选择解释或生成心电图，显著扩展了当前心电图模型的能力边界。

Conclusion: UniECG通过统一的框架解决了心电图理解和生成的双重挑战，为医疗AI应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on
vision-language tasks. However, these unified models typically fail to
correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor
can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we
propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently
performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG
generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model
first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then
injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment.
UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user
input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models.
Our code and checkpoints will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，用户偏好和模型偏好并不能准确预测哪些计划真正对用户有帮助，常见的对齐方法可能反而导致与帮助性错位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM生成计划的对齐方法是否真正反映了对用户的帮助性，而非仅仅是用户偏好。

Method: 使用Planorama界面，让126名用户回答300个多步骤问题，收集4388个计划执行和5584个比较数据，测量计划帮助性和用户偏好。

Result: 用户偏好、模型偏好和代理成功率都不能准确预测计划的帮助性；表面特征如简洁性和问题相似性与偏好相关但无法预测帮助性。

Conclusion: 需要基于真实用户交互的反馈来对齐有帮助的LLM，而不仅仅是看起来有帮助的偏好。

Abstract: To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step
instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans
are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer,
assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an
interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We
get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA
success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and
reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1)
user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans
help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this
gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful
when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and
question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to
predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from
real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we
discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

TL;DR: CAPE-KG是一个基于知识图谱的一致性感知参数保留知识编辑框架，用于解决多跳问答中知识编辑的一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的参数保留知识编辑方法在多跳问答中存在一致性问题，导致知识污染、更新不稳定和检索行为与预期编辑不符，影响了多跳推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出CAPE-KG框架，确保知识图谱的构建、更新和检索始终与多跳问答任务需求对齐，保持对未编辑和已编辑知识的一致推理。

Result: 在MQuAKE基准测试上的广泛实验显示，CAPE-KG在多跳问答的参数保留知识编辑性能上取得了准确性提升。

Conclusion: CAPE-KG通过解决一致性问题，有效提升了参数保留知识编辑在多跳问答中的性能，证明了关注一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Parameter-Preserving Knowledge Editing (PPKE) enables updating models with
new or corrected information without retraining or parameter adjustment. Recent
PPKE approaches based on knowledge graphs (KG) to extend knowledge editing (KE)
capabilities to multi-hop question answering (MHQA). However, these methods
often lack consistency, leading to knowledge contamination, unstable updates,
and retrieval behaviors that fail to reflect the intended edits. Such
inconsistencies undermine the reliability of PPKE in multi- hop reasoning. We
present CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge
Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures
KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements
of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited
knowledge. Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy
improvements in PPKE performance for MHQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of
addressing consistency in PPKE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个通过保形预测分析LLM-as-a-judge评估不确定性的框架，为LLM评分提供预测区间，并设计了序数边界调整和基于中点的低偏差评分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-judge范式在自然语言生成评估中应用广泛，但其评估的不确定性尚未充分探索，这种不可靠性限制了其在许多应用中的部署。

Method: 使用保形预测构建连续预测区间，为离散评分任务设计序数边界调整，提出基于区间中点的低偏差评分替代原始模型评分和加权平均。

Result: 实验表明保形预测能够提供具有覆盖保证的有效预测区间，区间中点和法官重新提示对改善判断有用。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了不确定性量化方法，提高了评估的可靠性，为实际应用提供了更稳健的评估工具。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language
models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the
uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability
may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first
framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of
LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs
continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an
ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a
midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model
score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis,
which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with
coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and
judge reprompting for better judgment.

TL;DR: MemOrb是一个轻量级即插即用的语言强化记忆层，通过将多轮交互提炼为紧凑的策略反思来提升LLM智能体在客服场景中的长期可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在客服场景中经常出现跨会话遗忘、重复错误和缺乏持续自我改进机制的问题，导致在动态环境中不可靠

Method: 提出MemOrb记忆层，将多轮交互提炼为策略反思存储在共享记忆库中，检索这些反思来指导决策，无需微调

Result: MemOrb显著提高了任务成功率和稳定性，在多轮成功率上获得高达63个百分点的提升，并在重复试验中提供更一致的性能

Conclusion: 结构化反思是增强冻结LLM智能体在客服场景中长期可靠性的有效机制

Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed
in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and
lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in
dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better
evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a
measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to
capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of
existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal
reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact
strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and
retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning.
Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and
stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success
rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our
results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for
enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service
scenarios.

TL;DR: LOTUSDIS是一个公开的泰语会议语料库，包含114小时自然对话，专门用于远场对话语音识别研究。该数据集通过多种麦克风设备在不同距离录制，包含重叠语音和真实声学效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练模型在泰语远场语音识别上表现不佳，存在数据不匹配问题。需要专门的数据集来提升远场ASR的鲁棒性。

Method: 收集114小时自发对话，使用9个独立单通道设备在0.12-10米距离录制，提供标准数据集划分和可复现基线系统，对Whisper模型进行零样本和微调测试。

Result: 微调后模型性能显著提升：整体WER从64.3降至38.3，远场WER从81.6降至49.5，在远距离麦克风上改善尤其明显。

Conclusion: 距离多样化的训练数据对鲁棒ASR至关重要，LOTUSDIS数据集有效解决了预训练数据与远场语音之间的不匹配问题。

Abstract: We present LOTUSDIS, a publicly available Thai meeting corpus designed to
advance far-field conversational ASR. The dataset comprises 114 hours of
spontaneous, unscripted dialogue collected in 15-20 minute sessions with three
participants, where overlapping speech is frequent and natural. Speech was
recorded simultaneously by nine independent single-channel devices spanning six
microphone types at distances from 0.12 m to 10 m, preserving the authentic
effects of reverberation, noise, and device coloration without relying on
microphone arrays. We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a
reproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under
zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong
degradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and
Thai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved
robustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and
far-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most
distant microphones. These results underscore the importance of
distance-diverse training data for robust ASR. The corpus is available under
CC-BY-SA 4.0. We also release training and evaluation scripts as a baseline
system to promote reproducible research in this field.

TL;DR: DyGRASP是一种新颖的动态文本属性图处理方法，结合LLMs和时序GNNs，有效捕捉近期和全局的时序语义，在动态图推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态文本属性图，难以处理动态文本属性图中随时间演化的图交互和文本属性，特别是忽略了近期-全局时序语义，且LLMs在处理大量动态文本时存在效率问题。

Method: 提出DyGRASP方法：1）使用节点中心隐式推理和滑动窗口机制捕捉近期时序语义；2）通过显式推理和RNN-like链结构捕获全局语义动态；3）通过更新和融合层整合近期/全局时序语义与动态图结构信息。

Result: 在DyTAG基准测试中，DyGRASP在目标节点检索任务的Hit@10指标上提升高达34%，且在不同时序GNNs和LLMs上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyGRASP通过有效整合LLMs和时序GNNs，成功解决了动态文本属性图中的时序语义捕捉问题，为动态图推理提供了高效有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph
interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world
applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing
methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global
temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts
and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying
LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic
Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to
efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a
node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism
to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture
global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored
prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,
we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as
the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.
Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,
achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.
Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs
and LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言分词器中词汇重叠对跨语言迁移的影响，通过控制实验发现词汇重叠有利于跨语言语义关系的捕捉，并能提升跨语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言分词器自然会产生跨语言的重叠词汇，但现有研究对于这种重叠是促进跨语言迁移还是引入语言间干扰存在争议，且受到词汇频率、分词粒度等因素的混淆影响。

Method: 设计了受控实验，在双语自回归模型上系统性地改变词汇重叠设置，并引入新的维度——跨语言共享词汇的语义相似性来分析重叠的影响。

Result: 分析模型隐藏表示发现，任何类型的重叠都能创建捕捉跨语言语义关系的嵌入空间，而在词汇不相交的模型中这种效应较弱。在XNLI和XQuAD任务上，有重叠的模型表现优于词汇不相交的模型，且随着重叠增加，迁移性能普遍提升。

Conclusion: 词汇重叠在多语言模型中具有优势，保持大量共享词汇仍然是多语言分词器的有益设计选择。

Abstract: Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce
overlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate
cross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages?
Prior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders,
such as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this
question, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual
autoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied
vocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to
understanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens
shared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations
and find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture
cross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in
models with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with
overlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer
performance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings
highlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that
substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for
multilingual tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统探讨了长上下文监督微调（SFT）对短上下文任务的影响，发现与长上下文预训练不同，长上下文SFT反而能提升短上下文性能，并揭示了其中的知识偏好偏差机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着实际应用对长上下文窗口需求的增加，长上下文数据的持续预训练和SFT成为常见方法。虽然预训练中数据长度的影响已有广泛研究，但SFT中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过解耦分析多头注意力（MHA）和前馈网络（FFN）两个关键组件，研究长上下文SFT对短上下文任务的影响机制，并探讨混合训练策略。

Result: 长上下文SFT能独立提升MHA和FFN的性能，但会产生知识偏好偏差：长上下文SFT促进上下文知识，短上下文SFT偏好参数知识。混合训练能缓解这种偏差。

Conclusion: 长上下文SFT对短上下文任务有积极影响，但需要平衡长短上下文训练以避免知识偏好偏差，为LLM微调提供了可解释的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications
increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach.
While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively
studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we
systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on
short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves
short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from
long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this
phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both
independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction
and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual
knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making
exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that
hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for
fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖专家判断和手动分析的方法存在主观性强、劳动密集且难以扩展的问题，需要系统化方法识别企业间风险关系。

Method: 利用10-K文件作为数据源，基于时间序列和词汇模式进行无监督微调，开发领域特定的金融编码器，并引入定量风险关系评分。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个评估设置下均优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别企业间隐含的风险关系，为投资组合管理和投资策略提供透明、可解释的分析工具。

Abstract: A multitude of interconnected risk events -- ranging from regulatory changes
to geopolitical tensions -- can trigger ripple effects across firms.
Identifying inter-firm risk relations is thus crucial for applications like
portfolio management and investment strategy. Traditionally, such assessments
rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which are, however, subjective,
labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a
systematic method for extracting inter-firm risk relations using Form 10-K
filings -- authoritative, standardized financial documents -- as our data
source. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach
captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised
fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings. This
enables the development of a domain-specific financial encoder with a deeper
contextual understanding and introduces a quantitative risk relation score for
transparency, interpretable analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在安全关键工程实践中稳健可靠地集成大语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing
increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the
building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a
specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed
to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.
The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level
cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,
Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were
derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to
specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset
encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted
primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.
Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable
and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses
leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear
performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite
demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization
and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,
particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing
complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.
Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and
development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into
safety-critical engineering practices.

Method: 采用模型差异分析这一机制解释性方法，使用crosscoders识别和分类两个模型之间的潜在表示差异。

Result: SimPO获得的潜在概念主要增强了安全机制（+32.8%）、多语言能力（+43.8%）和指令跟随（+151.7%），同时减少了模型自引用（-44.1%）和幻觉管理（-68.5%）的强调。

Conclusion: 模型差异分析能够提供超越排行榜指标的细粒度洞察，将性能差距归因于具体的机制能力，为比较LLMs提供了透明和有针对性的框架。

Abstract: As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language
models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly
important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model
outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic
interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences
between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we
identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two
models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance
safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and
instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces
emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management
(-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights
beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete
mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted
framework for comparing LLMs.

### [160] [MAPEX: A Multi-Agent Pipeline for Keyphrase Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18813)
*Liting Zhang,Shiwan Zhao,Aobo Kong,Qicheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPEX是一个基于多智能体协作的关键词提取框架，通过动态适应文档长度的双路径策略，显著提升了无监督关键词提取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督提示方法通常采用单阶段推理流程和统一提示策略，无法充分利用大语言模型的推理和生成能力，特别是在处理不同长度和复杂度的文档时效果受限。

Method: MAPEX引入多智能体协作机制，包含专家招募、候选提取、主题指导、知识增强和后处理等模块。采用双路径策略：短文本使用知识驱动提取，长文本使用主题指导提取。

Result: 在6个基准数据集和3种不同大语言模型上的实验表明，MAPEX在F1@5指标上平均优于当前最先进的无监督方法2.44%，优于标准LLM基线4.01%。

Conclusion: MAPEX框架通过多智能体协作和动态适应策略，有效提升了关键词提取的性能和泛化能力，为复杂场景下的关键词提取提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting,
regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs
hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities,
especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework
that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX
coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate
extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A
dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven
extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs
demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the
state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by
4.01\% in F1@5 on average. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文比较了开源大语言模型与闭源模型在生物医学问答任务中的表现，发现开源模型在某些情况下甚至优于闭源模型，特别是在使用集成策略时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型的快速发展，研究者希望了解小型开源模型是否能有效替代大型闭源模型，特别是在生物医学问答这一专业领域。

Method: 使用嵌入距离检索相关片段、上下文学习、结构化输出等技术增强问答能力，并对精确答案问题采用集成方法整合不同模型的输出。

Result: 开源大语言模型与闭源模型表现相当，在某些情况下（特别是应用集成策略时）甚至超越了闭源模型。

Conclusion: 开源大语言模型在生物医学问答任务中具有与闭源模型相当的竞争力，证明了开源模型的实用价值。

Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing,
with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to
proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small
open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source
models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical
question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B
of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models
against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various
techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding
distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions,
we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by
different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that
open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances,
open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when
ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at

*Luyan Zhang,Xinyu Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多层级特征集成在AI文本检测中的效果，发现尽管理论上多特征组合应该提供互补信号，但实际改进有限（0.4-0.5%），而计算成本显著增加（4.2倍），表明现代神经语言模型可能已高效捕获大部分相关检测信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型技术的快速发展，研究者对多特征方法是否能显著超越单一神经模型在AI文本检测中的表现产生兴趣。虽然直觉上语义、句法和统计特征的组合应提供互补信号，但这一假设尚未在现代LLM生成文本上得到严格测试。

Method: 实现了MHFD（多层级特征检测）方法，通过自适应融合集成基于DeBERTa的语义分析、句法解析和统计概率特征。

Result: 在多基准数据集上的实验结果表明，MHFD方法在域内检测中达到89.7%的准确率，在跨域检测中保持84.2%的稳定性能，相比现有方法有0.4-2.6%的适度改进。

Conclusion: 多特征集成仅提供微小收益但带来显著计算开销，表明现代神经语言模型可能已高效捕获大部分相关检测信号，多特征方法的实际价值有限。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is
growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve
AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition
suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should
provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested
with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical
investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection,
specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple
feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD
(Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic
analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through
adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite
theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits
(0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x
overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture
most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in
in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain
detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DivEye是一个基于意外性特征的新型AI生成文本检测框架，通过捕捉文本中不可预测性的波动来区分人类和AI生成内容


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器依赖token级似然度或不透明的黑盒分类器，难以应对高质量生成文本且缺乏可解释性。人类写作在词汇和结构不可预测性方面比LLM输出表现出更丰富的变异性

Method: 使用基于意外性的统计特征来捕捉文本中不可预测性的波动模式，这些特征具有可解释性

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DivEye比现有零样本检测器性能提升达33.2%，与微调基线模型性能相当。对改写和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性，跨领域和模型泛化能力强，作为辅助信号可将现有检测器性能提升18.7%

Conclusion: DivEye不仅提供检测能力，还能解释为何文本被标记为AI生成，指出节奏不可预测性是LLM检测中强大且未被充分探索的信号

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of
LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where
synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors
often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these
approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little
interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework
that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using
surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text
exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM
outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical
features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2%
and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple
benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks,
generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of
existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond
detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged,
pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal
for LLM detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集型的生成式大语言模型进行原子事实分解，这限制了可解释性和鲁棒性。研究旨在开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出JEDI编码器架构，使用合成理性语料库进行训练，联合执行提取式原子事实分解和可解释推理。

Result: JEDI在分布内达到竞争性准确性，在分布外和对抗性设置中显著提高了鲁棒性，优于仅基于提取式理性监督的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用仅编码器架构和合成理性可以实现NLI中的可解释性和鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as
automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance
interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on
resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform
decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly
performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference
without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training,
we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI
benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive
accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of
distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive
rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust
generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and
synthetic rationales. Code and data available at https://jedi.nicpopovic.com

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用动态时间规整（DTW）对齐语音和文本嵌入的方法，用于端到端语音翻译（E2E-ST），解决了现有方法需要语言特定对齐工具或对齐不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音翻译中语音和文本模态之间的表示差异需要解决。现有方法在词或标记级别对齐需要特定对齐工具，而基于最近邻相似度搜索的方法对齐不准确。

Method: 在训练过程中使用动态时间规整（DTW）对齐语音和文本嵌入，无需语言特定对齐工具。

Result: 该方法在E2E-ST中产生更准确的对齐，获得可比的结果且速度显著更快。在低资源设置下，6个语言方向中有5个优于先前工作。

Conclusion: DTW方法有效缩小了E2E-ST中的模态差距，提供更准确的对齐，在低资源场景表现优异，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) is the task of translating source
speech directly into target text bypassing the intermediate transcription step.
The representation discrepancy between the speech and text modalities has
motivated research on what is known as bridging the modality gap.
State-of-the-art methods addressed this by aligning speech and text
representations on the word or token level. Unfortunately, this requires an
alignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has
been addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor
similarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we
adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during
training. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method
produces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while
being significantly faster. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous work
in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统地研究了测试时缩放（TTS）在机器翻译中的应用，通过最佳N选择框架在WMT24基准测试上验证了其效果。研究表明TTS在高资源语言中能提升翻译质量，小模型通过大N值可以匹配或超越大模型，但在固定计算预算下大模型更高效，低资源情况下TTS可能因评估指标盲点而降低质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型参数缩放已成为改进NLP系统的标准策略，但计算成本高昂。测试时缩放（TTS）通过在推理时分配更多计算来生成多个候选并选择最佳结果，为机器翻译提供了一种替代方案。

Method: 采用简单实用的最佳N选择框架，在WMT24基准上进行系统实验，涵盖6个高资源和1个低资源语言对，5种模型规模（3B-72B），以及不同的TTS计算预算（N最大1024）。

Result: a) 高资源语言中TTS能通过多种神经MT评估指标提升翻译质量，人工评估确认了这一改进；b) 小模型通过大N值可以匹配或超越N=1时的大模型，但计算成本更高；c) 固定计算预算下大模型通常更高效，低资源情况下TTS可能因评估指标盲点而降低质量。

Conclusion: TTS为机器翻译提供了一种有效的替代方案，特别是在高资源语言中能显著提升质量，但需要权衡计算成本与性能增益，在低资源情况下需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP
systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference:
generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks
such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for
machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on
WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource
language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up
to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally
improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation
metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller
models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more
compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more
efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in
low-resource cases.

Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to
CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the
proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to
2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its
metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well
as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal
is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable
insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting
informed decisions and future directions in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Pathways of Thoughts (PoT)方法，通过建模LLM的推理过程为迭代决策，动态选择认知操作，探索多样化推理路径，然后根据用户偏好聚合候选响应，实现个性化QA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化QA系统对提升准确性和用户满意度至关重要，但目前面临从长、嘈杂、隐含上下文中推断偏好，以及生成同时正确、上下文适当且符合用户期望和背景知识的响应的挑战。

Method: PoT是一种推理阶段方法，适用于任何LLM且无需任务特定微调。它将LLM推理建模为迭代决策过程，动态选择推理、修订、个性化和澄清等认知操作，探索多样化推理轨迹，生成多样化候选响应，然后根据推断的用户偏好聚合和重新加权这些候选。

Result: 在LaMP-QA个性化QA基准测试中，PoT始终优于竞争基线，相对改进高达13.1%。人工评估证实了这些结果，注释者在66%的情况下偏好PoT的输出，仅在15%的情况下报告平局。

Conclusion: PoT通过建模推理为迭代决策过程并探索多样化推理路径，有效解决了个性化QA的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to
user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user
satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to
challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit
contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,
contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),
an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)
without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning
of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects
among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and
clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,
producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT
then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user
preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the
complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA
benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms
competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human
evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from
PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

TL;DR: 使用NLTK库分析不同语料库中的句子重复率，验证语言中大多数句子是否唯一这一语言学主张


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语言学中关于大多数语言表达都是独特的这一常见主张，特别是Pinker和Chomsky提出的观点，利用大型语料库进行实证研究

Method: 使用NLTK Python库解析不同体裁的语料库，统计每个语料库中完全相同的字符串匹配数量

Result: 虽然完全独特的句子通常是语料库中的大多数，但这高度受体裁限制，重复句子在任何单个语料库中都不是微不足道的部分

Conclusion: 语言表达独特性的主张需要根据具体体裁进行限定，重复句子在语言使用中占有重要地位

Abstract: A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances
are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam
Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or
understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time
in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large
corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current
paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora
of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results
show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora,
this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an
insignificant part of any individual corpus.

Motivation: 为资源有限的吉尔吉斯语创建首个高质量的命名实体识别数据集，填补该语言在NLP领域的空白，并探索多语言预训练模型在低资源语言处理中的有效性。

Method: 构建包含27个实体类别的标注数据集，评估传统序列标注方法（如条件随机场）和基于多语言Transformer的预训练模型（如RoBERTa）在数据集上的性能。

Result: 所有模型在罕见实体类别上都表现困难，但多语言RoBERTa模型在精确率和召回率之间取得了最佳平衡，其他多语言模型也获得了可比的结果。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练模型在处理低资源语言方面具有潜力，未来工作可以探索更细粒度的标注方案，为吉尔吉斯语处理管道评估提供更深入的见解。

Abstract: We introduce KyrgyzNER, the first manually annotated named entity recognition
dataset for the Kyrgyz language. Comprising 1,499 news articles from the 24.KG
news portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions
across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the
challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive
statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including
traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and
state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our
dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models
such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across
many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These
findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual
pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the
multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded
comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular
annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing
pipelines evaluation.

Motivation: 科学文献的快速增长需要高效的方法来组织和综合研究成果，现有基于无监督聚类或直接提示LLM的分类构建方法往往缺乏一致性和粒度。

Method: 利用LLM识别论文的关键方面（如方法、数据集、评估），生成特定方面的论文摘要，然后对每个方面进行编码和聚类以形成一致的层次结构。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著优于先前方法，在分类一致性、粒度和可解释性方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学文献组织提供了有效的解决方案，并引入了包含11.6k论文的156个专家制作分类的新评估基准，为该任务提供了首个自然标注数据集。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to
organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction
methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large
language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a
novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates
LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages
LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset,
evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then
encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In
addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted
taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated
dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的滥用风险之一是虚假信息传播，而现有的红队测试数据集主要针对英语和美国文化，缺乏多语言和多文化的评估能力。

Method: 从三个语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语）和两个地区（美国和印度）的事实核查网站收集虚假信息声明，将其聚类为更广泛的叙事，并使用知识图谱增强攻击LLM。

Result: 该方法相比少样本提示具有更高的攻击成功率，并提供了更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于真实世界对抗性滥用的、可全球扩展的虚假信息缓解措施。

Abstract: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming
evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across
diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and
English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel
red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across
languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking
websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies
(US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and
characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we
augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and
offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results
underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are
grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

Method: 通过NLP、写作和哲学领域专家的访谈开发分类体系，采用span级标注方法分析文本质量。

Result: 发现二元"slop"判断具有一定主观性，但这些判断与连贯性、相关性等潜在维度存在相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架可用于AI生成文本的检测和偏好评估任务，为理解影响质量判断的语言和风格因素提供新视角。

Abstract: AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality
AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this
term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy
of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and
propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through
span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat)
subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent
dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to
evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks,
potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors
that contribute to quality judgments.

*Natasha Butt,Ariel Kwiatkowski,Ismail Labiad,Julia Kempe,Yann Ollivier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强化学习学习连续CoT的可扩展方法，无需从离散CoT中蒸馏，使用软令牌和输入嵌入噪声进行RL探索，在数学推理基准上匹配或超越离散CoT性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续令牌相比离散令牌在CoT推理中具有更强的表达能力，但实际应用受到训练困难的限制，现有方法要么仅在推理时使用连续令牌，要么需要从离散CoT蒸馏且计算成本高。

Method: 使用强化学习学习连续CoT，采用软令牌（令牌混合和输入嵌入噪声）进行RL探索，计算开销最小，可学习数百个令牌的连续CoT。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上的数学推理基准测试中，连续CoT训练在pass@1上匹配离散CoT，在pass@32上超越，显示更大的CoT多样性。最佳方案是训练使用连续CoT令牌，推理使用离散令牌。

Conclusion: 连续CoT RL训练能更好地保留基础模型在域外任务上的预测，为基座模型提供更温和的调整。

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the
intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a
superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results
have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and
can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of
continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous
works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained
discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth
discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few
tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs
via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete
CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input
embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,
enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning
benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs
match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing
greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario
is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,
meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show
continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model
on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

TL;DR: OPRL是一种用于智能体强化学习的通用信用分配策略，通过交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和智能体策略，将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，解决了稀疏和不可验证奖励环境中的时间信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地使用强化学习训练作为自主智能体，但在交互环境中，稀疏且有时不可验证的奖励使得时间信用分配极具挑战性。现有方法存在标注偏差、奖励攻击、高方差等问题。

Method: OPRL交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和智能体策略，通过基于轨迹的DPO目标将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，然后结合结果奖励计算步骤级优势，用于策略更新，形成自我强化循环。

Result: 在WebShop、VisualSokoban和SOTOPIA三个不同智能体基准测试中，OPRL表现出优于前沿LLMs和强RL基线的性能，实现了最先进的结果，具有更高的样本效率和更低的训练方差。

Conclusion: OPRL通过理论保证和实证验证，证明了其在真实世界智能体学习中的潜力，能够实现高效探索和稳定训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in
interactive environments.
  However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit
assignment extremely challenging.
  Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but
suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly
fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.
  We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general
credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with
standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or
explicit step labels.
  In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with
the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step
rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.
  These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are
combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update,
creating a self-reinforcing loop.
  Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent
with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,
providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.
  Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including
WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with
unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
  Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL
baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher
sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.
  Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using
fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeCoDe是一个轻量级、模型无关的解码框架，通过对比解码和全局感知令牌调制策略，动态调整多模态大语言模型的安全决策能力，平衡过度敏感和不足敏感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在安全决策方面存在平衡问题，要么过度敏感（拒绝良性查询），要么不足敏感（错过视觉风险检测），需要一种能够根据多模态上下文动态调整安全决策的方法。

Method: SafeCoDe采用两阶段方法：1）对比解码机制，通过对比真实图像和高斯噪声图像来突出对视觉上下文敏感的令牌；2）全局感知令牌调制策略，将场景级推理与令牌级调整相结合，根据预测的安全判断来调整拒绝行为。

Result: 在多种MLLM架构和安全基准测试中的广泛实验表明，SafeCoDe能够持续改进上下文敏感的拒绝行为，同时保持模型的有用性。

Conclusion: SafeCoDe是一个有效的解码框架，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型在真实世界应用中的安全决策能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety
decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance
oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity
(missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in
safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive
Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that
dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe
operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights
tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised
images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates
scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according
to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM
architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity,
oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe
consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving
model helpfulness.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多种预训练注意力模型在电子健康记录信息提取任务上的性能，包括Bert Base、BioBert、Bio+Clinical Bert变体、RoBerta和Clinical Longformer。研究发现临床数据预训练的模型在药物检测方面表现更好，但通用领域预训练的Bert Base在药物事件上下文分类方面最有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于注意力的模型已成为临床笔记自然语言处理的主要方法，但需要比较不同预训练模型在电子健康记录信息提取任务上的性能差异。

Method: 使用哈佛医学院2022年n2c2挑战赛Track 1的Contextualized Medication Event Dataset，对多个预训练模型进行微调，执行药物提取、医疗事件检测和多维药物事件上下文分类任务。

Result: 临床数据预训练的模型在检测药物和药物事件方面更有效，但Bert Base在分类药物相关事件上下文方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同预训练策略的模型在不同类型的临床信息提取任务上各有优势，需要根据具体任务需求选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical
language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models
outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep-
resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done
amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two
variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task
related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks
from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges
(n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication
Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured
EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs.
The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting
contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using
data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED
to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and
multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods
are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied
models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on
constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics
including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models
pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and
medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to
be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to
medications.

TL;DR: CompLLM是一种针对长上下文处理的软压缩技术，通过将上下文分段独立压缩，实现线性复杂度、可扩展性和可重用性，显著提升长序列处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在处理长上下文时面临二次复杂度问题，现有压缩方法将上下文作为整体压缩，导致压缩复杂度高且无法重用计算。

Method: 将上下文划分为多个片段，对每个片段独立进行软压缩，支持片段缓存和跨查询重用。

Result: 在2倍压缩率下，CompLLM将首token生成时间加速最高4倍，KV缓存减少50%，在超长序列上性能甚至超过未压缩方法。

Conclusion: CompLLM提供了一种实用高效的上下文压缩方案，解决了长序列处理的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when
processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.
While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent
representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited.
Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which
leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse
computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we
introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical
deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it
into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice
yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales
linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short
sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and
reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across
different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at
high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x
and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance
comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses
it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical
utility.

Motivation: 计算资源指数级增长与高质量文本数据有限增长之间的差距限制了传统大语言模型扩展方法，需要新的训练范式来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用下一段推理目标，基于前文语境准确预测后续文本片段来构建奖励信号，让策略在预训练数据上自主探索轨迹进行强化学习。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中验证有效，Qwen3-4B-Base在MMLU、MMLU-Pro等基准上获得3.0-8.1分的绝对提升，展现出良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: RLPT扩展了大语言模型的推理边界，为强化学习提供了坚实基础，具有持续增益的潜力。

Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational
resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains
conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address
this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data
(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast
to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,
RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to
learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this
dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.
Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the
policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the
preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training
data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader
contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive
experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across
multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied
to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,
$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and
AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling
behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In
addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries
of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型中提取概念空间的方法，通过使用原型描述来编码特征，并通过对LLM进行微调来对齐原型嵌入与概念空间维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念空间使用认知上有意义的维度来表示实体和概念，在认知科学中广泛应用，并有望成为可解释AI的基石。然而，概念空间难以学习，尽管最近的LLM在捕获所需感知特征方面表现出色，但目前仍缺乏实用的提取方法。

Method: 提出一种策略，通过嵌入相应原型（如非常甜的食物）的描述来编码特征（如甜度）。为了改进这一策略，对LLM进行微调，使原型嵌入与相应的概念空间维度对齐。

Result: 实证分析发现这种方法非常有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为从LLM中提取概念空间提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案，有助于推动可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively
meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such
representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to
serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven
notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the
required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical
methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still
lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,
extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying
features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.
sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding
prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the
LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space
dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages like Slovak is
hindered by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we introduce
SloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of

standard Slovak benchmarks like Common Voice and FLEURS. For instance, the
fine-tuned Whisper-small model's WER dropped by up to 70\%, approaching the
baseline performance of the much larger Whisper-large-v3 model. To foster

Conclusion: 该工作填补了低资源语言意图分类的数据空白，计划持续维护和更新数据集，并开源相关代码，促进学术研究。

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years.
However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets,
which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high
rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written.
This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\%
of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is
actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To
tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset
(WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77
currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4
hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in
this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are
very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed
analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word
error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77
dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct

Motivation: 现有基准多为通用或全球范围，缺乏对特定文化（特别是印度文化）的深度覆盖。需要专门针对印度多样文化的基准来评估AI的文化理解能力。

Method: 构建包含印度所有邦和联邦属地的多语言多模态数据集，涵盖节日、服饰、美食、艺术形式等文化主题。评估了多种视觉语言模型在零样本和思维链设置下的表现。

Result: 当前模型在处理文化相关的多模态输入时存在明显局限，特别是在低资源语言和较少记录的传统文化方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: DRISHTIKON填补了包容性AI研究的重要空白，为推进文化感知的多模态语言技术提供了强大的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual
benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the
cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks
with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage
across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and
union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The
dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines,
art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range
of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models,
proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models,
across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key
limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded,
multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented
traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a
robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织在使用AI时面临选择商业LLM服务还是本地部署的决策困境，商业云服务虽然方便但存在数据隐私、供应商锁定和长期成本等问题

Method: 考虑硬件需求、运营费用和最新开源模型（如Qwen、Llama、Mistral等）的性能基准，然后比较本地部署总成本与主要云服务商的订阅费用

Result: 基于使用水平和性能需求提供了估计的盈亏平衡点

Conclusion: 研究结果为组织规划LLM战略提供了实用的决策框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread.
Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important
decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on
their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to
state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data
privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating
costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This
paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations
determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared
to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,
operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source
models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost
of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription
fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels
and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework
for planning their LLM strategies.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation
scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture
time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry
machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and
interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and
Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil
moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced
reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis
without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting
time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed
prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation
gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable
reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data
from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the
United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method
in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately
classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and
recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to
capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide
interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study
highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision
agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and
data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture
monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统未能以符合临床推理的方式明确量化或传达不确定性，现有可解释AI和不确定性估计技术各自存在局限性，限制了AI在医学领域的应用。

Method: 通过系统地将医学不确定性映射到AI不确定性概念，识别XUE实施的关键挑战，并提出多模态不确定性量化、模型无关可视化技术和不确定性感知决策支持系统等技术方向。

Result: 建立了XUE框架的理论基础，明确了实现有效XUE的指导原则，为开发与真实临床复杂性相一致的AI系统铺平道路。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过桥接可解释性和不确定性，有助于开发可信赖的医疗AI，强调AI系统不仅需要生成可靠预测，还需要以临床有意义的方式表达置信水平。

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current
medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a
way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on
interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability
of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques
provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect
between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we
propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability
with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and
identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions
for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,
model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support
systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE
realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only
generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a
clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of
trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the
way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

### [187] [HSGM: Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory for Scalable Long-Text Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18168)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSGM是一种分层段图记忆框架，通过将长文档分解为有意义的段落，构建局部语义图并提取摘要节点，显著降低了长文档语义解析的计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文档语义解析中二次复杂度增长和内存需求过高的问题，使超长文本的语义建模能够扩展到实时和资源受限的NLP应用中。

Method: 将输入文档分解为M个段落，为每个段落构建局部语义图，提取摘要节点形成全局图记忆，支持增量更新和分层查询处理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，HSGM实现了2-4倍的推理加速，峰值内存减少超过60%，同时保持≥95%的基线准确率。

Conclusion: HSGM框架为超长文本的可扩展、准确语义建模提供了有效解决方案，理论复杂度从O(N²)降低到O(Nk + (N/k)²)。

Abstract: Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic
growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce
\textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that
decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs
\emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact
\emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports
\emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph
construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query
Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes
and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.
  Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to
$O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive
Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node
summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks
-- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes),
and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference
speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of
baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling
for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP
applications.

*Ling Yue,Nithin Somasekharan,Tingwen Zhang,Yadi Cao,Shaowu Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foam-Agent是一个多智能体框架，通过单一自然语言提示自动化整个OpenFOAM工作流程，解决了CFD模拟的复杂性和学习曲线问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟在工程中至关重要，但其陡峭的学习曲线和复杂的手动设置构成了重大障碍。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括：1）端到端模拟自动化，处理网格生成、HPC脚本和可视化；2）基于MCP的可组合服务架构；3）通过分层多索引RAG实现高保真配置生成。

Result: 在110个模拟任务基准测试中，Foam-Agent使用Claude 3.5 Sonnet实现了88.2%的成功率，显著优于现有框架（MetaOpenFOAM为55.5%）。

Conclusion: Foam-Agent显著降低了CFD的专业门槛，展示了专用多智能体系统如何民主化复杂科学计算。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in
engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create
significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow
from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical
gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:
Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,
including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of
handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic
generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via
ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,
the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as
discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other
agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.
High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a
Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a
dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%
success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing
frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the
expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems
can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at

### [189] [Large Language Models and Operations Research: A Structured Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18180)
*Yang Wang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了大语言模型（LLMs）在运筹学（OR）中的集成应用，主要涵盖自动建模、辅助优化和直接求解三个方向，并讨论了评估基准、领域应用及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学方法依赖专家建模和手动参数调整，难以处理大规模、动态和多约束问题。LLMs通过语义理解、结构化生成和推理控制，有望解决这些局限性。

Method: 将LLMs集成到OR的方法分为三类：自动建模（将自然语言描述转换为数学模型或可执行代码）、辅助优化（生成启发式算法和演化算法）以及直接求解优化任务。

Result: LLMs在OR中展示了潜力，但存在语义到结构映射不稳定、研究进展碎片化、泛化能力有限和评估体系不足等关键问题。

Conclusion: 本文总结了LLMs在OR中的进展，并指出了未来研究方向，以推动LLMs在OR中的进一步应用。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex
system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply
chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which
depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face
challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these
limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and
reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into
mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms,
and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on
the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions:
automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further
reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes
key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented
research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.
Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role
of LLMs in OR.

### [190] [Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA): Behavioral Theory-Guided LLMs for Ridesourcing Mode Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18181)
*Mustafa Sameen,Xiaojian Zhang,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAPA框架，利用大语言模型合成理论驱动的潜在态度来预测网约车选择模式，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车模式选择模型预测精度有限，无法捕捉关键心理因素，且面临严重的类别不平衡问题（网约车出行仅占日常出行的小部分）。

Method: SAPA框架采用分层方法：1）使用LLM从原始出行调查数据生成定性旅行者画像；2）训练倾向得分模型；3）LLM为理论驱动的潜在变量分配定量分数；4）最终分类器整合倾向得分、潜在变量分数和可观测出行属性。

Result: 在大规模多年出行调查上的实验表明，SAPA在测试集上的PR-AUC指标比最先进基线方法提升了75.9%。

Conclusion: 该研究为准确预测网约车模式选择提供了有力工具，且方法可轻松迁移到各种应用中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and
implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion,
improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models
for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive
accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are
further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise
only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting
Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict
ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler
personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model
on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce
an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to
theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final
classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their
interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode
choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing
choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.
This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode
choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various
applications.

*Nursultan Askarbekuly,Timur Fayzrakhmanov,Sladjan Babarogić,Ivan Luković*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OBER是一个基于学习成果的教育推荐系统，通过将学习成果和评估项目嵌入数据模式，使任何推荐算法都能根据其促进的掌握程度进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数教育推荐系统仅基于点击或评分相关性进行调优和评估，其真正的教学影响不明确。需要一种能够直接衡量推荐系统对学生学习成果影响的方法。

Method: OBER采用简约的实体关系模型、基于日志的掌握度公式和插件架构。在非正式学习领域的电子学习系统中进行了为期两周的随机分组测试，比较了固定专家路径、协同过滤和基于知识的过滤三种方法。

Result: 协同过滤方法最大化了用户留存率，但固定路径方法实现了最高的掌握度。OBER可以从相同的日志数据中得出业务、相关性和学习指标。

Conclusion: OBER框架是方法无关的，可以轻松扩展到未来的自适应或情境感知推荐系统，让从业者能够在没有额外测试开销的情况下权衡相关性和参与度与成果掌握度。

Abstract: Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or
rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We
introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning
outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm
can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist
entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in
architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was
evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners
across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF),
and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path
achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and
learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and
engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The
framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or
context-aware recommenders.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MMCD的多模态协作决策框架，用于解决自动驾驶系统中传感器故障或连接车辆缺失时的鲁棒决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设训练和测试时所有数据模态和连接车辆都可用，这在实际中不现实，因为可能存在传感器故障或连接车辆缺失的情况。

Method: 采用基于跨模态知识蒸馏的师生模型结构，教师模型使用多模态数据训练，学生模型设计为在模态减少时仍能有效工作。

Result: 在连接自动驾驶和空地车辆协作实验中，该方法将驾驶安全性提高了20.7%，在潜在事故检测和安全驾驶决策方面超越了现有最佳基线。

Conclusion: MMCD框架通过多模态协作和知识蒸馏技术，显著提升了自动驾驶系统在挑战性环境下的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in
accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single
vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of
accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,
leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising
solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data
modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is
impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal
Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses
multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance
decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when
certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach
based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model
structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while
the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.
In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$
and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves
driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline
in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions. More

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种形式化方法来解释定量双极论证框架（QBAF）中推理变化的原因，通过追踪论证强度不一致性及其解释机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在QBAF中进行推理并更新框架时，需要解释论证强度顺序变化的原因，帮助理解推理过程的变化。

Method: 定义强度不一致性概念，识别充分、必要和反事实解释，提出基于启发式的解释搜索方法并实现相应系统。

Result: 证明了强度不一致性解释存在的充要条件，开发了有效的解释搜索实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为QBAF中的推理变化提供了系统的解释框架，有助于理解和调试论证推理过程。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions
from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on),
our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the
partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some
arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength
inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We
identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength
inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and
only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based
approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for
which we also provide an implementation.

*Amitava Das*

TL;DR: 本文提出了神经DNA（nDNA）作为捕捉AI基础模型潜在认知身份的语义-基因型表示，通过三个几何维度来表征模型的内部认知结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试只能衡量模型行为，但模型的"灵魂"存在于其潜在几何结构中。作者希望开发一种能够捕捉模型内在认知身份的方法，类似于生物DNA编码遗传信息。

Method: nDNA从三个几何维度合成：谱曲率（揭示概念流动的曲率）、热力学长度（量化语义转换所需的努力）和信念矢量场（描述信念方向导向的语义扭转场）。

Result: nDNA提供了一个稳定的、坐标无关的神经DNA指纹，可用于追踪模型谱系、测量继承关系、检测漂移，并研究人工认知的演化。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了神经基因组学新领域，将AI模型视为具有可追溯内部认知的数字语义有机体，为模型比较、风险诊断和治理提供了新方法。

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What
shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output?
Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent
geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic
representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic
geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and
indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals
the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which
quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational
transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the
semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.
Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,
found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural
drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not
just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:
meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is
the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how
meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free
neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we
cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,
alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between
checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,
ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,
diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

*Kei-Sing Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了相似性场理论，这是一个数学框架，用于形式化实体间相似性关系及其演化的原理。该理论定义了相似性场、系统演化、概念纤维和生成算子，并基于此形式化地定义了智能的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为持久化和转换相似性关系是任何可理解动态系统的结构基础，需要建立一个数学框架来形式化相似性值及其演化的原则。

Method: 定义了相似性场S: U×U→[0,1]，满足自反性但允许不对称性和非传递性；引入系统演化序列Z_p=(X_p,S^(p))；定义概念纤维F_α(K)和生成算子G；基于此形式化智能的定义。

Result: 证明了两个定理：(i)不对称性阻止相互包含；(ii)稳定性需要锚坐标或最终限制在f的水平集内。这些结果确保了相似性场演化的约束性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 相似性场理论为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供了基础语言，并可用于解释大语言模型和将其作为社会认知的实验探针。

Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the
structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces
Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the
principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We
define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of
entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed
relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the
evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by
$p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers
$F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of
the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that
produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative
definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a
concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of
$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field
Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and
constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks
mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or
eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the
evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,
culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large
language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"N-Plus-1"GPT代理框架，通过多个独立求解代理和一个比较代理来提高机械工程问题分析的可靠性，解决单一GPT模型85%成功率的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT在机械工程分析中表现出不稳定性，单一实例的成功率仅为85%，这种不可靠性使其不适合直接用于教育或工程实践。需要一种机制来提高解决方案的可靠性。

Method: 采用"N-Plus-1"代理框架：首先启动N个独立的求解代理生成N个解决方案，然后通过比较代理汇总、比较这些方案并推荐最佳解决方案。基于孔多塞陪审团定理，当每个求解代理的成功概率大于1/2且N足够大时，多数解决方案很可能是正确的。

Result: 该框架能够显著提高解决方案的可靠性，比较代理还能整合不同的数学模型和求解方法。与商业多代理模型Grok Heavy相比，该框架更注重透明度和教学价值。

Conclusion: "N-Plus-1"代理框架为GPT在机械工程领域的可靠应用提供了有效解决方案，特别适合教育环境，通过多代理协作提高了分析结果的准确性和可信度。

Abstract: Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a
mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed
solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in
one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success
probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT
unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an
"N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering
Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to
yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes
Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution
Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from
Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by
per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the
Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high
probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,
Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)
Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative
Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or
alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a
commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but
also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and
pedagogical value.

Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的方法存在推理延迟高、样本效率差、无法在设备上部署等问题，需要更实用的桌面应用自动化解决方案

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，包含三模态状态编码器（截图、任务ID、数值状态），集成元动作和提前停止机制，使用紧凑视觉骨干网络和小型策略网络（1500万参数）

Result: 在135个真实桌面任务测试中，简单任务成功率92.1%，困难任务成功率58.8%，模型大小减少4个数量级，推理时间减半，性能匹配或超过2000亿参数的大模型基线

Conclusion: 分层强化学习为计算机控制提供了一种实用、可扩展的替代方案，相比单一的大型多模态语言模型具有显著优势

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet
under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest
screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but
they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on
long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We
introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,
ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process
(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task
ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates
meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and
uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device
inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,
ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on
hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on
simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and
halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a
practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for
computer control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前医学基准测试存在严重问题，大型前沿模型虽然在基准测试中得分很高，但实际表现脆弱，容易受到输入变化影响，且存在猜测和编造推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示医学AI基准测试的局限性，证明高分数并不等同于真实的医学理解能力和临床实用性。

Method: 对六个旗舰模型在六个广泛使用的医学基准上进行压力测试，包括移除关键输入、改变提示词等方法，并通过临床医生指导的评分标准进行评估。

Result: 发现模型在基准测试中的高分数掩盖了脆弱性和捷径学习问题，基准测试之间差异很大但被错误地等同对待。

Conclusion: 医学基准测试分数不能直接反映真实世界的准备程度，需要关注模型的鲁棒性、合理推理能力以及与真实医学需求的匹配度。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过推理长度约束和模型量化两种计算约束策略，在降低推理模型计算需求的同时评估其对模型安全性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展虽然能通过生成长链思维序列提升推理语言模型性能，但带来显著计算成本增加。本研究旨在探索在计算约束下保持模型性能的方法，并分析计算效率与安全性之间的权衡。

Method: 采用两种方法：1）使用基于长度控制策略优化的强化学习方法微调推理模型，满足用户定义的推理长度；2）应用量化技术，在用户定义的计算约束内最大化链思维序列生成。

Result: 论文研究了计算约束策略对推理模型性能的影响，重点关注计算效率与安全性的平衡关系。

Conclusion: 计算约束策略（推理长度约束和模型量化）是降低推理模型计算需求的有效方法，但需要在计算效率和模型安全性之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the
performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought
(CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant
increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute
constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model
quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and
study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two
approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning
reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based
reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length,
and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences
within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off
between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

*Moran Feldman,Amin Karbasi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了Gödel测试，评估GPT-5在解决组合优化中简单未解猜想的能力，结果显示模型在常规推理上有进步，但在跨论文综合方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型是否能在更高级数学领域解决新的简单猜想，而不仅仅是高中和大学数学竞赛问题。

Method: 选择五个组合优化中的猜想，提供相关源论文但隐瞒具体猜想，详细评估GPT-5的推理过程。

Result: GPT-5在三个较简单问题上产生接近正确的解，甚至在一个问题上推翻了原猜想；但在需要跨论文综合的问题上失败，在无验证猜想的难题上分析失败。

Conclusion: GPT-5在常规推理上取得有意义进展，偶尔展现原创性，但在跨论文综合方面仍有明显局限，可能是通过Gödel测试的早期步骤。

Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong
results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains
unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more
advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether
a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved
conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures
in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source
papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then
assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5
produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different
approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while
providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required
combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a
validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but
failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.
Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on
routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations
when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step
toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

### [203] [ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18400)
*Pritish Yuvraj,Siva Devarakonda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个HTS代码分类基准，基于美国海关裁决在线搜索系统构建，并展示了微调的Atlas模型在10位和6位分类上的显著性能提升，同时成本更低且支持数据隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTS代码分类是全球贸易中的关键瓶颈，但机器学习社区对此关注不足。错误分类可能导致货物运输中断，因此需要开发准确、高效的分类方法。

Method: 构建了基于美国海关CROSS系统的HTS代码分类基准数据集，对领先的LLMs进行评估，并微调了Atlas模型（基于LLaMA-3.3-70B）。

Result: 微调的Atlas模型在10位分类上达到40%的准确率，6位分类达到57.5%，分别比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking提升15和27.5个百分点，且成本降低5-8倍。

Conclusion: Atlas模型为HTS分类设立了强基线，但该任务仍具挑战性。通过发布数据集和模型，旨在将HTS分类确立为新的社区基准任务，促进检索、推理和对齐方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little
attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt
shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the
U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark
for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online
Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned
Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit
classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements
of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.
Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and
eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to
guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While
Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with
only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim
to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite
future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

*Nikolai Skripko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IFEval-FC是一个专门评估大语言模型在函数调用中精确遵循格式指令能力的基准测试，填补了现有基准测试只关注参数正确性而忽略格式规范的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试如BFCL、tau^2-Bench和ACEBench只评估参数正确性，但没有测试模型是否遵循参数描述中嵌入的格式指令（如双引号、ISO日期格式等），这对于实际AI代理系统至关重要。

Method: IFEval-FC在JSON schema描述中直接编码可验证的格式要求，包含750个测试用例，每个用例包含一个函数及其输入参数的嵌入格式要求，以及相应的用户查询，评估过程完全算法化。

Result: 结果显示即使是GPT-5和Claude 4.1 Opus等最先进的专有模型也经常无法遵循基本的格式规则，揭示了实际代理系统的局限性。

Conclusion: IFEval-FC强调了精确指令遵循在函数调用中的重要性，为评估和改进大语言模型的格式遵循能力提供了标准化工具，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for
AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench
(arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to
format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing
values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.
  We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911)
that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC
encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for
example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750
test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of
its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully
algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.
  Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including
GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules,
highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems. The complete
codebase and data are publicly available at

Result: 创建了多模态基准来展示任务中的各种真实挑战，Pensieve在QA准确率上比现有最佳解决方案提升高达14%。

Conclusion: Memory-QA任务提出了重要的现实挑战，Pensieve管道通过综合方法有效解决了这些挑战，在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering
recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal
memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of
task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

Motivation: 解决击剑裁判中主观判断、人为错误、偏见以及训练环境中裁判资源有限的问题

Method: 集成姿态多标签动作识别和规则推理：提取2D关节位置，计算101维运动学特征，使用Transformer进行分类，结合语言模型编码优先权规则

Result: 在有限标注数据下，5折交叉验证平均macro-F1得分为0.549，优于TCN、BiLSTM和普通Transformer等基线模型

Conclusion: 虽然尚未达到部署标准，但展示了击剑裁判自动化辅助的可行前景，为AI在击剑领域的应用（如教练辅助）开辟了新机会

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing:
subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice
environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI
referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action
recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from
video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and
applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To
determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with
encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for
each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation
achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines,
including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla
Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a
promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new
opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMZ+提出了一种基于提示白名单的防御机制，替代传统的恶意意图检测方法，通过上下文特异性确保LLM代理只接收安全且符合预定义用例的消息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI代理具有对数据源和API工具的特权访问，其非确定性行为带来重大安全风险。现有防御机制主要依赖恶意意图检测，但这种方法存在局限性。

Method: 采用提示白名单方法，只允许上下文适当且安全的消息与代理LLM交互，通过预定义用例和操作边界来规范用户与LLM之间的交换。

Result: 实验评估显示LLMZ+对常见越狱提示具有强韧性，同时不影响合法业务通信，在实验环境中误报率和漏报率均可降至0。

Conclusion: LLMZ+方法简化了安全框架，增强了长期韧性，减少了维持LLM信息安全所需的资源，提供了一种有效的替代防御方案。

Abstract: Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable
target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data
sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical
agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI
(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This
characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational
security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely
on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,
thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this
paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond
traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.
Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are
permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of
context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM
conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach
streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and
reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against
the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business
communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly
between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach
using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to
0 in our experimental setting.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法，通过将数学问题分解为方程，使用外部符号方程求解器生成答案，并通过LLM进行二次估算来验证答案准确性，在数学问题求解上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决数学应用题方面存在困难，因为需要复杂的推理和数学能力。现有方法虽然有所改进，但仍需更有效的解决方案。

Method: 首先提示LLM从问题分解中创建方程，使用外部符号方程求解器生成答案；然后让LLM进行第二次估算来验证答案准确性；如果验证失败，采用迭代修正过程确保找到正确答案。

Result: 该方法在数值和代数数学应用题数据集上取得了新的最先进结果，平均比之前最佳结果提高了近2%。在三角函数问题上也获得了满意结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM解决数学问题的能力，并引入了两个新数据集来进一步测试LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including
problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word
Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning
and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts
have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study
proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from
a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic
equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained
answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is
instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of
estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is
then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an
iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is
eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on
datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs,
improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In
addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a
task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also
introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the
testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合地理空间建模和进化学习的新型基于代理的模型，用于评估气候变化对经济系统的复杂影响，特别是洪水风险通过供应链产生的级联效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候风险评估需要建模空间异质性灾害与适应性经济系统之间的复杂相互作用，现有方法难以捕捉供应链中的系统性风险。

Method: 开发了结合Mesa空间建模和CLIMADA气候影响评估的地理空间代理模型，引入进化学习机制让企业通过适应度选择和突变来演化预算分配、定价、工资和风险适应策略。

Result: 使用RCP8.5情景下的河流洪水预测到2100年，显示进化适应使企业能在数十年气候压力后恢复到基线生产水平，但未直接暴露于洪水的代理仍会通过供应链中断受到影响，世纪末商品平均价格比基线高5.6%。

Conclusion: 该开源框架为金融机构和公司提供了量化直接和级联气候风险的工具，同时评估成本效益适应的策略。

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between
spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a
novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with
evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based
spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive
learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget
allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection
and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections
under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to
converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of
disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even
agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply
chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher
under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides
financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and
cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied
approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large
Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the
high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering
large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective
framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost.
Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the
retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used
graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

Conclusion: 论文强调了ML模型与其明确描述之间的区别的重要性，并通过语义保持的方法为航空系统中ML模型的安全合规性提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems.
However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to
guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be
demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an
EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level
objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains
training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the
difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description,
referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines
the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate
replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use
cases to build and compare several target models.

Conclusion: DataAgents代表了向自主数据到知识系统的范式转变，需要推进行动工作流优化、建立开放数据集和基准生态系统、保障隐私、平衡效率与可扩展性，并开发可信赖的防护机制。

Abstract: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming,
and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale.
Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment
between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways
that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:
how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?
Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task
decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can
autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,
reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and
execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,
DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to
diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a
paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are
capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,
transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and
retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and
unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why
the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a
critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their
architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and
capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance
action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,
safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy
DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

*Xingkun Yin,Kaibin Huang,Dong In Kim,Hongyang Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出经验扩展框架，通过自主环境交互和协作经验共享实现LLM的持续进化，突破静态人类生成数据的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过扩大模型规模、训练数据和计算能力的方法已接近饱和，人类生成文本资源枯竭，需要新的持续学习路径

Method: 经验扩展框架：捕获原始交互→提炼为紧凑可重用知识→定期优化存储内容以保持相关性和效率

Result: 在模拟真实场景中验证，包括未见相关任务泛化、重复查询处理、知识库过饱和等情况，经验扩展提高了准确性、维持长期性能并在新情境中保持增益

Conclusion: 结构化部署后学习能够超越静态人类生成数据的限制，为持续智能进步提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

TL;DR: ADS是一个分布式目录服务，用于发现AI代理的能力、元数据和来源，采用内容寻址存储、分层分类和加密签名实现高效可验证的多维度发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构多代理系统中代理能力发现和验证的挑战，提供标准化的代理注册和互操作性解决方案。

Method: 基于Open Agentic Schema Framework构建，采用两级映射架构（Kademlia DHT），重用OCI/ORAS基础设施，集成Sigstore用于来源验证。

Result: 建立了可扩展的代理目录架构，支持多种代理模式（LLM提示代理、MCP服务器等），具备安全性和性能保障。

Conclusion: ADS为新兴代理注册和互操作性倡议提供了重要的基础设施，推动了多代理系统的发展。

Abstract: The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the
discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages
content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing
to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across
heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema
Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location
through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash
Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact
distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven
extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers,
A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model,
describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance
properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent
registry and interoperability initiatives.

### [216] [Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18836)
*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMCHECKER是一种基于模型检验的方法，用于验证LLM文本生成过程的概率计算树逻辑(PCTL)属性。该方法通过α-k有界文本生成来限制验证范围，聚焦于每个生成步骤中top-k令牌的累积概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本生成过程缺乏形式化验证方法，无法确保生成文本的一致性和可靠性。作者发现文本生成过程中通常只选择有限数量的令牌，这为形式化验证提供了可能性。

Method: 提出α-k有界文本生成方法：在每个生成步骤中，仅考虑累积概率超过阈值α的top-k令牌。LLMCHECKER基于此构建有限状态模型，然后应用PCTL模型检验技术进行形式化验证。

Result: 该方法在多个LLM模型（Llama、Gemma、Mistral、Genstruct、BERT）上进行了验证，能够有效检查文本生成过程的PCTL属性，如文本质量和偏见评估。

Conclusion: LLMCHECKER是首个将PCTL模型检验应用于LLM文本生成过程一致性的方法，为LLM的可靠性和安全性提供了形式化验证框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification
method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of
an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number
of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the
same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation,
narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the
top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification
method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while
accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text
quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens,
only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability.
LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of
$\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in
several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our
knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to
check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个模块化框架，用于ICD-10-CM编码预测，通过系统化模型选择、冗余感知数据采样和结构化输入设计，提高自动化医疗编码的准确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICD编码对临床文档、计费和医疗分析至关重要，但目前仍是劳动密集且易出错的任务。尽管大语言模型在自动化ICD编码方面有潜力，但在基础模型选择、输入情境化和训练数据冗余方面存在挑战。

Method: 开发了一个模块化框架，包括：1）使用LLM-as-judge评估协议和Plackett-Luce聚合来评估开源LLM；2）引入基于嵌入的相似性度量和冗余感知采样策略；3）利用台湾医院的结构化出院摘要评估情境效果。

Result: 在两个机构数据集上的实验表明，经过微调的基础模型在内部和外部评估中始终优于基线LLM。包含更多临床部分能持续提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究使用开源LLM建立了一个实用且原则性的ICD-10-CM编码预测方法，为自动化医疗编码系统的实际部署提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical
for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a
labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs)
show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model
selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their
effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled
model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design.
The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce
aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic
comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based
similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove
semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge
summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine
section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling
paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the
selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in
internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections
consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs
to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for
real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed
model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO)方法，解决了GRPO中的优势函数反转和镜像问题，通过动态重新加权优势函数来适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在优势函数分配上存在优势反转和优势镜像问题，阻碍了不同查询样本间合理的优势分配。

Method: 提出MAPO策略，引入优势百分比偏差来处理高确定性轨迹样本，并动态重新加权优势函数以适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。

Result: 与相关最先进方法的比较以及对不同优势变体的消融研究验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPO是一种简单但有效的GRPO策略，能够自适应地配置优势函数以考虑样本特定特征。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the
performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage
function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory
importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion
and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation
across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective
GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the
trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent
deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we
dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory
certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for
sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art
methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了ProfileBench基准和Conf-Profile框架，用于解决用户画像任务中标签稀缺和异构数据噪声的问题，通过置信度驱动的两阶段训练显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户画像作为用户理解的核心技术，LLMs为其提供了有前景的途径，但缺乏全面基准和大规模真实标签的挑战阻碍了进展

Method: 提出Conf-Profile框架：第一阶段利用高级LLMs合成高质量标签，通过置信度加权投票和校准；第二阶段通过置信度引导的无监督强化学习增强推理能力

Result: 实验结果表明Conf-Profile通过两阶段训练显著提升性能，在Qwen3-8B上F1分数提高了13.97

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了用户画像中的标签稀缺和可靠性问题，为LLMs在用户画像任务中的应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer
structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by
the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,
encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.
However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of
collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy
user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free
and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning
framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize
high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed
by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence
calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,
rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a
lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided
unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty
filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental
results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through
the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的LLM记忆操作定义和四部分分类法，建立了记忆四元组框架，通过三设置协议实现公平比较，构建了分层评估体系，并提出了可测试的命题，为LLM记忆研究提供了可复现、可比较和可治理的坐标系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM记忆研究中缺乏统一操作定义、评估标准不一致、治理机制不完善等问题，建立一个系统性的记忆分析框架。

Method: 提出记忆四元组（位置、持久性、写入/访问路径、可控性）和三设置协议（仅参数、离线检索、在线检索），构建分层评估体系，并开发DMM Gov治理框架协调多种技术。

Result: 建立了一个包含参数记忆、上下文记忆、外部记忆和程序/情景记忆的完整评估框架，能够系统性地分析LLM的记忆能力和治理需求。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆研究提供了标准化的评估坐标，支持可复现的比较和可治理的部署，推动了LLM记忆机制的理解和应用发展。

Abstract: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent
state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be
addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy
(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple
(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,
evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To
avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a
three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)
that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and
timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book
recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves
and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet
attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency
and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and
leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and
uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with
multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM
Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),
and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,
monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict
handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable
propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally
constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with
small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a
reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and
deployment.

Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter
open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities
are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with
long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start
training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and
equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.
Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples
optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and
subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly
Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic
ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL
framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over
synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,
LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional
efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%
(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We
release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a
critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous
systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving
human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we
present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of
existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training
strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial
intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial
understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence
benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.
Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between
perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks
but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly
in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial
imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain
in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap
and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field. The

Method: 提出DEAL框架，集成低秩适应（LoRA）和持续微调策略，包含知识保留和自适应参数更新模块。

Result: 在15个不同数据集上的实验表明，DEAL在任务准确性和资源效率方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强任务性能和资源效率，展现了在LLMs中推进持续适应的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the
critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific
tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible.
Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing
models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications.
However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting
and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that
integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy.
By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the
framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining
efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets
show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding
substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in
LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like
cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being
deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,
scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable
potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which
can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the
overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep
understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based
agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of
hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete
workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types
of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct
an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence
of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of
existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and
detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this
survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in
LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and
reliable agent systems.

Motivation: 现有可解释AI研究多依赖自动评估指标，但无法真实反映用户需求和感知，因此需要采用用户中心的方法来评估解释质量。

Method: 基于约束矩阵分解的可解释推荐模型，通过精心设计的LLM提示将模型结构转化为自然语言解释，并进行326名参与者的用户研究评估五种关键维度。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective,
user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation
model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types
are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as
observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted
scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural
language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in
explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to
capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a
user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed
the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency,
effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the
recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are
perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying
model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals
that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate
statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore
how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary
insights beyond the quantitative results.

### [226] [Remaining Time Prediction in Outbound Warehouse Processes: A Case Study (Short Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18986)
*Erik Penther,Michael Grohs,Jana-Rebecca Rehse*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种剩余时间预测方法在物流公司出库仓库流程中的表现，发现深度学习模型精度最高，但浅层方法如传统提升技术在计算资源需求上更少且精度具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测过程监控是过程挖掘的子领域，旨在预测正在进行的流程执行的未来。常见的预测目标是剩余时间，即流程执行完成所需的时间。本文旨在在真实物流公司的出库仓库流程中比较不同剩余时间预测方法的性能。

Method: 在物流公司提供的包含169,523条轨迹的原始事件日志上，比较了四种剩余时间预测方法，包括深度学习模型和浅层方法（如传统提升技术）。

Result: 深度学习模型实现了最高的预测精度，但浅层方法如传统提升技术达到了具有竞争力的精度，且需要显著更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 虽然深度学习在剩余时间预测上精度最高，但浅层方法在精度和计算效率之间提供了更好的平衡，特别是在资源受限的实际应用场景中。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to
forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target
is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process
execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time
prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics
company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us
with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make
publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve
the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques
achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational
resources.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于玩家视角的Landmarks、Monuments和Beacons概念，用于自动分解程序生成内容，以解决算法评估与人类体验不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序生成内容的算法评估难以找到与人类体验一致的指标，特别是对于复合产物。自动分解作为一种解决方案需要满足一系列属性的概念。

Method: 借鉴游戏研究和游戏AI研究，引入了基于可感知性、唤起性和行动召唤的Landmarks、Monuments和Beacons嵌套概念，这些概念具有游戏通用性，可跨类型使用。

Result: 论证了这些实体可以通过当前研究和工业中使用的技术进行发现和评估，为程序生成内容的完全自动分解和重要子组件评估开辟了路径。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在连接人文学科和技术游戏研究，实现更好的计算性程序生成内容评估，虽然重点强调混合主动程序生成和组合性程序生成，但相信其应用范围更广。

Abstract: Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find
metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts.
Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a
range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI
research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks},
\textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the
artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a
player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across
genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques
currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully
automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components.
Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and
compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this
approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical
game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个使用可观测源作为辅助变量的因果表示学习框架，能够在已知潜在因果图的情况下识别整个潜在变量，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果表示学习框架通常将辅助变量限制为混合函数外部的变量，但在某些情况下，系统驱动的潜在因素可以从数据中轻松观测或提取，这可能有助于识别。

Method: 引入可观测源作为辅助变量的框架，使用保体积编码器实现潜在变量的子空间变换和排列识别，并提供变量选择方案来选择最大化潜在因素可恢复性的辅助变量。

Result: 实验在合成图和图像数据上证明了该框架的有效性，能够扩展当前方法的边界。

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用可观测源作为辅助变量，显著提高了因果表示学习的识别能力，为更广泛的现实应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate
observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent
structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works
often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.
However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external
to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can
be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating
identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources
being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main
results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise
transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover,
when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a
variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the
latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic
graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

TL;DR: CoPiC提出了一种基于代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器的LLM规划方法，通过生成多样化高级规划程序并利用训练好的批评器选择最优计划，显著减少LLM查询成本并提高长期奖励对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划方法依赖频繁查询进行迭代优化，导致高查询成本且难以实现长期奖励对齐。需要一种既能减少查询次数又能优化长期规划性能的方法。

Method: 1. 使用LLM生成多样化高级规划程序；2. 程序迭代生成和优化候选计划；3. 训练领域自适应批评器评估候选计划；4. 选择与长期奖励最对齐的计划执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld、NetHack和StarCraft II Unit Building三个环境中，CoPiC相比AdaPlanner和Reflexion基线方法，平均成功率提升23.33%，查询成本降低91.27%。

Conclusion: CoPiC通过代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器的结合，有效解决了LLM规划中的查询成本高和长期奖励对齐问题，在多个复杂环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI
agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world
knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and
environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address
this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine
plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query
costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental
feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.
We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of
relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of
high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate
plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and
selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using
high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as
estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.
Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC
outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving
an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in
query costs.

TL;DR: AgentInit是一个针对多智能体系统（MAS）的初始化方法，通过优化智能体团队结构来提升系统性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MAS初始化方法未能充分考虑生成智能体在后续阶段的协作需求，因此需要一种能够优化智能体团队结构的初始化方法。

Method: AgentInit结合多轮智能体交互和反思，采用自然语言到格式的机制确保一致性，并应用帕累托原则进行平衡的团队选择策略，同时考虑团队多样性和任务相关性。

Result: 实验表明AgentInit在各种框架和任务中均优于现有初始化方法和预定义策略，总体性能提升分别达到1.2和1.6倍，同时显著减少token消耗。

Conclusion: AgentInit具有良好的可迁移性，关键组件有效性得到验证，证明其作为可靠MAS初始化方法的能力和适应性。

Abstract: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent
systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's
efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do
not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in
subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we
propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.
Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between
agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to
Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team
selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to
jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective
and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments
show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization
methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,
achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,
respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further
analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the
effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and
adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在阿拉伯世界的跨文化常识推理迁移，发现仅需少量文化特定示例即可显著提升模型在其他文化背景下的性能，证明了高效跨文化对齐的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在西方中心偏见，限制了其在多元文化背景下的有效性。虽然已有研究探索文化对齐，但跨文化迁移的潜力（利用一种文化的对齐来提升其他文化的性能）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用覆盖13个阿拉伯国家的文化基础常识推理数据集，评估轻量级对齐方法（如上下文学习和演示强化DITTO），并与监督微调和直接偏好优化等基线方法进行比较。

Result: 仅需来自一个国家的12个文化特定示例，就能使多语言模型在其他国家的性能平均提升10%。此外，来自印度尼西亚和美国等非阿拉伯文化的演示也能在多项选择推理中达到或超越阿拉伯文化内的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 研究证明了高效跨文化对齐的可行性，为将LLMs适配到低资源文化环境提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

TL;DR: 使用图像机器学习模型分析Ulam螺旋中不同区域的质数分布规律性，发现在较大数值区域（约5亿附近）比小数值区域（低于2500万）更容易学习到质数模式，表明质数分布在更高数量级上具有更强的规律性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质数分布具有确定性和随机性的双重特性，研究旨在探索机器学习能否作为数论研究的新实验工具，特别是分析质数在不同数量级区域的分布规律性差异。

Method: 采用图像聚焦的机器学习模型，在Ulam螺旋的不同区域提取数据块进行训练和比较，分析模型在不同区域的准确率、精确率和召回率表现。

Result: 在5亿附近区域训练的模型性能优于在2500万以下区域训练的模型，表明前者存在更易学习的规律性；模型在不同区域采用不同的分类策略，小数值区域更注重识别质数模式，大数值区域更注重排除合数。

Conclusion: 机器学习可作为数论研究的新实验工具，该方法在密码学中强质数和弱质数的模式研究方面具有应用潜力，支持数论猜想中关于质数分布在更高数量级上噪声减少、平均规律占主导的观点。

Abstract: Research on the distribution of prime numbers has revealed a dual character:
deterministic in definition yet exhibiting statistical behavior reminiscent of
random processes. In this paper we show that it is possible to use an
image-focused machine learning model to measure the comparative regularity of
prime number fields at specific regions of an Ulam spiral. Specifically, we
demonstrate that in pure accuracy terms, models trained on blocks extracted
from regions of the spiral in the vicinity of 500m outperform models trained on
blocks extracted from the region representing integers lower than 25m. This
implies existence of more easily learnable order in the former region than in
the latter. Moreover, a detailed breakdown of precision and recall scores seem
to imply that the model is favouring a different approach to classification in
different regions of the spiral, focusing more on identifying prime patterns at
lower numbers and more on eliminating composites at higher numbers. This aligns
with number theory conjectures suggesting that at higher orders of magnitude we
should see diminishing noise in prime number distributions, with averages
(density, AP equidistribution) coming to dominate, while local randomness
regularises after scaling by log x. Taken together, these findings point toward
an interesting possibility: that machine learning can serve as a new
experimental instrument for number theory. Notably, the method shows potential
1 for investigating the patterns in strong and weak primes for cryptographic
purposes.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠的基于联邦学习的模型市场铺平了道路，解决了数据异构性和算法兼容性的关键问题。

Abstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marketplaces have become
essential platforms for facilitating the exchange of data products to foster
data sharing. Model transactions provide economic solutions in data
marketplaces that enhance data reusability and ensure the traceability of data
ownership. To establish trustworthy data marketplaces, Federated Learning (FL)
has emerged as a promising paradigm to enable collaborative learning across
siloed datasets while safeguarding data privacy. However, effective data
valuation and selection from heterogeneous sources in the FL setup remain key
challenges. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework centered on a
Wasserstein-based estimator tailored for FL. The estimator not only predicts
model performance across unseen data combinations but also reveals the
compatibility between data heterogeneity and FL aggregation algorithms. To
ensure privacy, we propose a distributed method to approximate Wasserstein
distance without requiring access to raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
model performance can be reliably extrapolated under the neural scaling law,
enabling effective data selection without full-scale training. Extensive
experiments across diverse scenarios, such as label skew, mislabeled, and
unlabeled sources, show that our approach consistently identifies
high-performing data combinations, paving the way for more reliable FL-based
model marketplaces.

<details>

Motivation: 研究结构偏置在不同需求机制下对牛鞭效应预测的帮助或阻碍作用，为混合建模提供具体指导

Method: 使用单级测试平台，在三种需求机制（AR(1)、i.i.d.高斯、重尾对数正态）下比较NODE和UDE方法，通过不同比例的训练数据评估多步预测性能

Result: 在结构化需求机制下，UDE泛化能力更好（库存RMSE从4.92降至0.26）；在重尾需求下，NODE的灵活性更优；随着训练数据减少，NODE出现相位漂移，UDE保持稳定但对罕见峰值反应不足

Conclusion: 当噪声为轻尾或时间相关时应强制结构约束；当极端事件主导时应放松结构约束。这为科学和工程系统中的混合建模提供了指导原则

Abstract: We study learning of continuous-time inventory dynamics under stochastic
demand and quantify when structure helps or hurts forecasting of the bullwhip
effect. BULL-ODE compares a fully learned Neural ODE (NODE) that models the
entire right-hand side against a physics-informed Universal Differential
Equation (UDE) that preserves conservation and order-up-to structure while
learning a small residual policy term. Classical supply chain models explain
the bullwhip through control/forecasting choices and information sharing, while
recent physics-informed and neural differential equation methods blend domain
constraints with learned components. It is unclear whether structural bias
helps or hinders forecasting under different demand regimes. We address this by
using a single-echelon testbed with three demand regimes - AR(1)
(autocorrelated), i.i.d. Gaussian, and heavy-tailed lognormal. Training is done
on varying fractions of each trajectory, followed by evaluation of multi-step
forecasts for inventory I, order rate O, and demand D. Across the structured
regimes, UDE consistently generalizes better: with 90% of the training horizon,
inventory RMSE drops from 4.92 (NODE) to 0.26 (UDE) under AR(1) and from 5.96
to 0.95 under Gaussian demand. Under heavy-tailed lognormal shocks, the
flexibility of NODE is better. These trends persist as train18 ing data
shrinks, with NODE exhibiting phase drift in extrapolation while UDE remains
stable but underreacts to rare spikes. Our results provide concrete guidance:
enforce structure when noise is light-tailed or temporally correlated; relax
structure when extreme events dominate. Beyond inventory control, the results
offer guidance for hybrid modeling in scientific and engineering systems:
enforce known structure when conservation laws and modest noise dominate, and
relax structure to capture extremes in settings where rare events drive
dynamics.

Motivation: 永久监测系统的广泛使用增加了数据可用性，但大型桥梁网络中的可扩展性挑战日益突出。管理多个结构需要高效跟踪和比较长期行为，因此相似结构间的知识迁移变得至关重要。

Method: 采用基于模型的迁移学习方法，使用神经网络代理模型。将一个桥梁上训练的模型适配到具有相似特征的另一个桥梁上，这些模型捕捉共享的损伤机制。将迁移模型集成到贝叶斯推理框架中，基于监测数据的模态特征进行连续损伤评估。

Result: 使用两个桥梁的真实数据进行验证，结果显示该方法对损伤位置、严重程度和范围具有高敏感性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了实时监测能力，实现了跨结构知识迁移，促进了智能监测策略的发展，提高了网络层面的韧性。

Abstract: The growing use of permanent monitoring systems has increased data
availability, offering new opportunities for structural assessment but also
posing scalability challenges, especially across large bridge networks.
Managing multiple structures requires tracking and comparing long-term
behaviour efficiently. To address this, knowledge transfer between similar
structures becomes essential. This study proposes a model-based transfer
learning approach using neural network surrogate models, enabling a model
trained on one bridge to be adapted to another with similar characteristics.
These models capture shared damage mechanisms, supporting a scalable and
generalizable monitoring framework. The method was validated using real data
from two bridges. The transferred model was integrated into a Bayesian
inference framework for continuous damage assessment based on modal features
from monitoring data. Results showed high sensitivity to damage location,
severity, and extent. This approach enhances real-time monitoring and enables
cross-structure knowledge transfer, promoting smart monitoring strategies and
improved resilience at the network level.

Result: 在8个广泛使用的基准数据集上的综合实验一致证明了AdaMixT在现实场景中的有效性

Conclusion: AdaMixT通过自适应多尺度特征融合机制，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting future values based
on historical observations. However, existing approaches primarily rely on
predefined single-scale patches or lack effective mechanisms for multi-scale
feature fusion. These limitations hinder them from fully capturing the complex
patterns inherent in time series, leading to constrained performance and
insufficient generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture named Adaptive Weighted Mixture of Multi-Scale Expert Transformers
(AdaMixT). Specifically, AdaMixT introduces various patches and leverages both
General Pre-trained Models (GPM) and Domain-specific Models (DSM) for
multi-scale feature extraction. To accommodate the heterogeneity of temporal
features, AdaMixT incorporates a gating network that dynamically allocates
weights among different experts, enabling more accurate predictions through
adaptive multi-scale fusion. Comprehensive experiments on eight widely used
benchmarks, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI, and four ETT
datasets, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixT in real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确识别船舶类型对于安全监管和打击非法、未报告和无管制(IUU)活动至关重要，特别是在狭窄水域如波罗的海的博恩霍尔姆海峡。

Method: 使用历史AIS数据，通过前向/后向填充航行记录、去除异常值、分段处理轨迹，提取31个轨迹级特征，采用基于树的模型（随机森林）进行分类，并进行分组训练/测试分割以避免数据泄露。

Result: 随机森林模型在测试集上达到92.15%的准确率，宏精确率94.11%，宏召回率92.51%，宏F1分数93.27%。特征重要性分析显示桥位比和最大航速是最具区分性的特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于AIS轨迹的轻量级特征能够在狭窄水域实现实时船舶类型分类，具有操作价值，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of vessel types from Automatic Identification System
(AIS) tracks is essential for safety oversight and combating illegal,
unreported, and unregulated (IUU) activity. This paper presents a strait-scale,
machine-learning pipeline that classifies moving vessels using only AIS data.
We analyze eight days of historical AIS from the Danish Maritime Authority
covering the Bornholm Strait in the Baltic Sea (January 22-30, 2025). After
forward/backward filling voyage records, removing kinematic and geospatial
outliers, and segmenting per-MMSI tracks while excluding stationary periods
($\ge 1$ h), we derive 31 trajectory-level features spanning kinematics (e.g.,
SOG statistics), temporal, geospatial (Haversine distances, spans), and
ship-shape attributes computed from AIS A/B/C/D reference points (length,
width, aspect ratio, bridge-position ratio). To avoid leakage, we perform
grouped train/test splits by MMSI and use stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
Across five classes (cargo, tanker, passenger, high-speed craft, fishing;
N=1{,}910 trajectories; test=382), tree-based models dominate: a Random Forest
with SMOTE attains 92.15% accuracy (macro-precision 94.11%, macro-recall
92.51%, macro-F1 93.27%) on the held-out test set, while a tuned RF reaches
one-vs-rest ROC-AUC up to 0.9897. Feature-importance analysis highlights the
bridge-position ratio and maximum SOG as the most discriminative signals;
principal errors occur between cargo and tanker, reflecting similar transit
behavior. We demonstrate operational value by backfilling missing ship types on
unseen data and discuss improvements such as DBSCAN based trip segmentation and
gradient-boosted ensembles to handle frequent-stop ferries and further lift
performance. The results show that lightweight features over AIS trajectories
enable real-time vessel type classification in straits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PCA方法处理高维解场时计算开销大，需要更高效的方法来降低神经算子学习的计算成本

Method: 提出两种patch-based方法：局部到全局patch PCA和局部到局部patch PCA，并探索重叠patch平滑滤波和CNN细化两种改进策略

Result: 基于patch的PCA方法将端到端流水线处理时间减少3.7-4倍，同时保持高精度

Conclusion: patch-based PCA是PDE系统中高效算子学习的有前景技术，在计算效率和精度之间取得良好平衡

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

*Faizul Rakib Sayem,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文优化的新框架，将子空间表示学习与提示调优相结合，用于改进大规模视觉语言模型的OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的OOD检测方法仅依赖softmax概率，忽略了视觉语言模型在数百万样本上学习到的丰富特征嵌入的判别潜力。

Method: 通过将ID特征投影到由提示向量张成的子空间中，同时将ID无关特征投影到正交零空间中，设计了一个易于处理的端到端学习准则。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够同时确保强大的OOD检测性能和高的ID分类准确率。

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

*Sheng Wong,Ravi Shankar,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面比较了用于自动产前CTG分析的最先进AI方法，发现微调后的LLMs在性能上优于基础模型和领域特定方法，为临床CTG解释提供了有前景的替代途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子胎儿监护（EFM）/胎心监护（CTG）分析是评估胎儿健康的关键技术，但目前基础模型和大型语言模型在这一领域的潜力尚未充分探索。CTG评估主要依赖主观临床解释，导致诊断准确性存在差异和及时妊娠护理的偏差。

Method: 系统比较时间序列基础模型和LLMs与已建立的CTG特定架构，评估涵盖500多个不同时长的CTG记录，反映了真实世界的临床记录。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在性能上优于基础模型和领域特定方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为胎儿监护应用中不同AI方法的相对优势提供了关键见解，并为产前护理中未来临床AI发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains through training on massive
datasets. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in healthcare
applications, yet their potential for electronic fetal monitoring
(EFM)/cardiotocography (CTG) analysis, a critical technology for evaluating
fetal well-being, remains largely underexplored. Antepartum CTG interpretation
presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of fetal heart rate (FHR)
patterns and uterine activity, requiring sophisticated analysis of long
time-series data. The assessment of CTG is heavily based on subjective clinical
interpretation, often leading to variability in diagnostic accuracy and
deviation from timely pregnancy care. This study presents the first
comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art AI approaches for automated
antepartum CTG analysis. We systematically compare time-series FMs and LLMs
against established CTG-specific architectures. Our evaluation encompasses over
500 CTG recordings of varying durations reflecting real-world clinical
recordings, providing robust performance benchmarks across different modelling
paradigms. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior
performance compared to both foundation models and domain-specific approaches,
offering a promising alternative pathway for clinical CTG interpretation. These
findings provide critical insights into the relative strengths of different AI
methodologies for fetal monitoring applications and establish a foundation for
future clinical AI development in prenatal care.

Conclusion: 研究目标是识别多GPU执行中的负载不均衡问题及其对计算性能的影响，并评估DPU网络在缓解这些问题方面的潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive inference in large transformer-based language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges for runtime efficiency, particularly during the
decode phase where load imbalance across GPU shards can cause throughput
degradation and latency spikes. A DPU-assisted framework leveraged by
BlueField-3 Data Processing Units can enable real-time detection and mitigation
of load imbalance in multi-node tensor-parallel inference. By offloading
monitoring tasks to the DPU and analyzing GPU telemetry and inter-node
communication patterns, the resulting system can provide actionable feedback to
inference controllers and schedulers. The goal of this study is three-fold i)
identify the reported skews/imbalances/pathological conditions that arise in
muti-GPU execution of a) LLM tensor computing (both during training and
inference), b) identify their impact on computational performance, and c) make
a critical assessment if those can be tracked for potential mitigation from a
DPU network.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的空间平衡注意力块用于时空预测，通过将空间图划分为子图，分别学习局部和全局空间相关性，构建可扩展的多尺度预测模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在遵循空间邻近性和捕捉全局相关性之间取得平衡，解决现有方法在空间相关性建模方面的局限性

Method: 将空间图划分为子图，使用子图内注意力学习局部空间相关性，通过子图间注意力进行子图间消息传递以捕获全局相关性，构建多尺度预测模型

Result: 在真实世界的中大型时空数据集上，相比基线方法性能提升最高达7.7%，且运行成本较低

Conclusion: 所提出的模型既具有可扩展性又能产生结构化的空间相关性，且易于实现，在效率和效果上均表现出色

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Balance Attention block for
spatiotemporal forecasting. To strike a balance between obeying spatial
proximity and capturing global correlation, we partition the spatial graph into
a set of subgraphs and instantiate Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local
spatial correlation within each subgraph; to capture the global spatial
correlation, we further aggregate the nodes to produce subgraph representations
and achieve message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention.
Building on the proposed Spatial Balance Attention block, we develop a
multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively increasing the
subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce
structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. We
evaluate its efficacy and efficiency against the existing models on real-world
spatiotemporal datasets from medium to large sizes. The experimental results
show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 7.7% over the baseline
methods at low running costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了摊销潜在转向（ALS）方法，通过在推理时应用离线计算的单个向量来替代昂贵的逐查询优化循环，实现2-5倍加速，同时保持或超越贪婪思维链和自一致性基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时优化方法（如迭代优化和多步验证）计算成本过高，限制了在实际生产环境中的部署。需要一种更高效的潜在空间优化方法。

Method: ALS计算成功与不成功生成的隐藏状态之间的平均差异向量，在推理时用这个方向向量校准模型的隐藏表示，当解码偏离成功流形时将其推回。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH-500基准测试中，ALS比迭代方法快2-5倍，同时匹配或超越贪婪CoT和自一致性基线，效率-准确率权衡提升高达101%。

Conclusion: 研究表明潜在优化的主要收益可以通过离线方式捕获，使复杂推理技术能够在生产环境中实际部署。

Abstract: Test-time optimization remains impractical at scale due to prohibitive
inference costs\textemdash techniques like iterative refinement and multi-step
verification can require $10$--$100\times$ more compute per query than standard
decoding. Latent space test-time optimization methods like LatentSeek offer a
more direct approach by steering hidden representations, but still demand
expensive per-query optimization loops with multiple backward passes. We
propose Amortized Latent Steering (ALS), which collapses this iterative
optimization into a single offline-computed vector applied at constant cost
during inference. ALS computes the mean difference between hidden states from
successful versus unsuccessful generations, then uses this direction to
calibrate the model's hidden representations: when decoding drifts away from
the success manifold, ALS nudges activations back toward it. Across GSM8K and
MATH-$500$ benchmarks, ALS achieves $2$--$5\times$ speedup over iterative
methods while matching or surpassing greedy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
Self-Consistency baselines, yielding up to 101\% improvement in
efficiency--accuracy trade-off. These results show that much of latent
optimization's benefit can be captured offline, making sophisticated reasoning
techniques viable for production deployment. Code is available

algorithm uses Bayesian statistics to model users' browsing behavior, focusing
on their habits rather than group preferences. It is distinguished by its
online incremental learning, allowing reliable predictions even with little
data and in the case of a changing environment. This inference method generates
a task model, providing a graphical representation of navigation with the usage
statistics of the current user. The algorithm learns new tasks while preserving
prior knowledge. The theoretical framework is described, and simulations show
the effectiveness of the approach in stationary and non-stationary
environments. In conclusion, this research paves the way for adaptive systems

TL;DR: 该论文将轻量级随机梯度下降(L-SGD)算法扩展到RISC-V架构的微控制器上，通过8位量化技术显著降低了内存使用和训练时间，同时保持了模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物联网设备缺乏GPU等专用加速器，云端训练存在隐私和连接依赖问题。联邦学习需要高效的优化算法，而RISC-V架构缺乏对设备端训练的稳健支持。

Method: 扩展L-SGD算法到RISC-V MCU平台，评估32位浮点运算性能，并引入8位量化版本的L-SGD来克服RISC-V MCU缺乏浮点单元的限制。

Result: 8位量化L-SGD在RISC-V平台上实现了内存使用减少近4倍，训练速度提升2.2倍，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 量化L-SGD算法使RISC-V MCU能够高效进行设备端训练，为物联网设备的联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern IoT devices increasingly rely on machine learning solutions to process
data locally. However, the lack of graphics processing units (GPUs) or
dedicated accelerators on most platforms makes on-device training largely
infeasible, often requiring cloud-based services to perform this task. This
procedure often raises privacy-related concerns, and creates dependency on
reliable and always-on connectivity. Federated Learning (FL) is a new trend
that addresses these issues by enabling decentralized and collaborative
training directly on devices, but it requires highly efficient optimization
algorithms. L-SGD, a lightweight variant of stochastic gradient descent, has
enabled neural network training on Arm Cortex-M Microcontroller Units (MCUs).
This work extends L-SGD to RISC-V-based MCUs, an open and emerging architecture
that still lacks robust support for on-device training. L-SGD was evaluated on
both Arm and RISC-V platforms using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic,
highlighting the performance impact of the absence of Floating-Point Units
(FPUs) in RISC-V MCUs. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce an 8-bit
quantized version of L-SGD for RISC-V, which achieves nearly 4x reduction in
memory usage and a 2.2x speedup in training time, with negligible accuracy
degradation.

Motivation: 开发有效的移动GUI代理面临挑战，主要由于任务难度呈现重尾分布和大规模环境采样的低效率，这限制了强化学习在移动界面自动化中的应用。

Method: 提出了MOBILERL框架，核心是ADAGRPO算法，包含难度自适应正向回放、失败课程过滤和最短路径奖励调整策略，这些策略共同稳定RL训练并提高样本效率。

Result: 在两个开源模型上应用MOBILERL，生成的MOBILERL-9B模型在AndroidWorld上达到75.8%的成功率，在AndroidLab上达到46.8%的成功率，均为最先进水平。

Conclusion: MOBILERL框架有效提升了移动GUI代理的性能，已被AutoGLM产品采用并开源，为移动界面自动化提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Building general-purpose graphical user interface (GUI) agents has become
increasingly promising with the progress in vision language models. However,
developing effective mobile GUI agents with reinforcement learning (RL) remains
challenging due to the heavy-tailed distribution of task difficulty and the
inefficiency of large-scale environment sampling. We present an online agentic
reinforcement learning framework MOBILERL to enhance GUI agents in mobile
environments. Its core component is the Difficulty-Adaptive GRPO (ADAGRPO)
algorithm. In ADAGRPO, we design difficulty-adaptive positive replay and
failure curriculum filtering to adapt the model to different task difficulties.
We introduce the shortest path reward adjustment strategy to reshape rewards
concerning the task length in multi-turn agentic tasks. Those strategies
jointly stabilize RL training, improve sample efficiency, and generate strong
performance across diverse mobile apps and tasks. We apply MOBILERL to two open
models (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and GLM-4.1V-9B-Base). The resultant MOBILERL-9B
model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of success rates on both
AndroidWorld (75.8%) and AndroidLab (46.8%). The MOBILERL framework is adopted
in the AutoGLM products, and also open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注统计异质性，但忽视了机构间的经济竞争关系。当机构作为市场竞争对手时，它们可能因担心效用损失而不愿参与联合训练，且统计异质性和竞争关系的综合影响尚未充分探索。

Method: CoCoGen框架通过学习和性能效用公式描述竞争和统计异质性，将每轮训练建模为加权潜在博弈，并基于生成AI推导最大化社会福利的数据生成策略。

Conclusion: CoCoGen成功解决了联邦学习中统计异质性和经济竞争的双重挑战，为竞争环境下的协作学习提供了有效的建模和优化方法。

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (CFL) enables organizations (e.g., hospitals or
banks) to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while
preserving data privacy by keeping data local. While prior work has primarily
addressed statistical heterogeneity across organizations, a critical challenge
arises from economic competition, where organizations may act as market rivals,
making them hesitant to participate in joint training due to potential utility
loss (i.e., reduced net benefit). Furthermore, the combined effects of
statistical heterogeneity and inter-organizational competition on
organizational behavior and system-wide social welfare remain underexplored. In
this paper, we propose CoCoGen, a coopetitive-compatible data generation
framework, leveraging generative AI (GenAI) and potential game theory to model,
analyze, and optimize collaborative learning under heterogeneous and
competitive settings. Specifically, CoCoGen characterizes competition and
statistical heterogeneity through learning performance and utility-based
formulations and models each training round as a weighted potential game. We
then derive GenAI-based data generation strategies that maximize social
welfare. Experimental results on the Fashion-MNIST dataset reveal how varying
heterogeneity and competition levels affect organizational behavior and
demonstrate that CoCoGen consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost) were trained
and evaluated using optimized hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed
primarily using F1-score, Gmean, and AUC metrics. Results demonstrate that
ensemble methods (Extra Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost), as well as

Motivation: 医疗系统面临有限的护理资源分配压力，传统优化和启发式方法难以处理动态多约束环境。

Result: 在模拟实验中使用真实数据，相比基线启发式和无约束RL方法，NurseSchedRL实现了更高的排班效率、更好的技能-需求匹配以及更低的疲劳度。

Conclusion: 强化学习在复杂高风险医疗人力管理中具有决策支持潜力。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face increasing pressure to allocate limited nursing
resources efficiently while accounting for skill heterogeneity, patient acuity,
staff fatigue, and continuity of care. Traditional optimization and heuristic
scheduling methods struggle to capture these dynamic, multi-constraint
environments. I propose NurseSchedRL, a reinforcement learning framework for
nurse-patient assignment that integrates structured state encoding, constrained
action masking, and attention-based representations of skills, fatigue, and
geographical context. NurseSchedRL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
feasibility masks to ensure assignments respect real-world constraints, while
dynamically adapting to patient arrivals and varying nurse availability. In
simulation with realistic nurse and patient data, NurseSchedRL achieves
improved scheduling efficiency, better alignment of skills to patient needs,
and reduced fatigue compared to baseline heuristic and unconstrained RL
approaches. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for
decision support in complex, high-stakes healthcare workforce management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车基础设施的快速发展，保护基于物联网的充电站免受网络威胁变得至关重要。集中式入侵检测系统存在隐私问题，而现有的联邦学习评估忽略了系统异构性和非IID数据等实际挑战。

Method: 使用FedAvg和FedAvgM两种优化方法，在系统异构性和非IID数据条件下进行实验，评估联邦学习在EV充电站异常检测中的性能。

Result: 在IID设置下，FedAvg性能优于使用相同神经网络的集中式模型。但在非IID数据和系统异构性条件下性能下降。FedAvgM在异构环境下始终优于FedAvg，表现出更好的收敛性和更高的异常检测准确率。

Conclusion: 联邦学习能够处理物联网EVCS中的异构性而不显著损失性能，FedAvgM是构建鲁棒、隐私保护的EVCS安全的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized training framework widely used in
IoT ecosystems that preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, making it
ideal for IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems with sensing and communication
like Smart Grids (SGs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV), and Electric
Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). With the rapid expansion of electric vehicle
infrastructure, securing these IoT-based charging stations against cyber
threats has become critical. Centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
raise privacy concerns due to sensitive network and user data, making FL a
promising alternative. However, current FL-based IDS evaluations overlook
practical challenges such as system heterogeneity and non-IID data. To address
these challenges, we conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of
federated learning for anomaly detection in EV charging stations under system
and data heterogeneity. We used FedAvg and FedAvgM, widely studied optimization
approaches, to analyze their effectiveness in anomaly detection. Under IID
settings, FedAvg achieves superior performance to centralized models using the
same neural network. However, performance degrades with non-IID data and system
heterogeneity. FedAvgM consistently outperforms FedAvg in heterogeneous
settings, showing better convergence and higher anomaly detection accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that FL can handle heterogeneity in IoT-based EVCS without
significant performance loss, with FedAvgM as a promising solution for robust,
privacy-preserving EVCS security.

TL;DR: Safe-SAIL是一个用于解释大型语言模型中稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征的框架，旨在提高安全领域的机制理解，通过系统识别最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE、解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略来扩展解释过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全研究主要关注评估LLM输出或特定安全任务，无法解决更广泛、未定义的风险。SAE有助于通过解释从纠缠信号中分解出的单义原子特征来阐明模型行为，但先前应用未将特征与细粒度安全相关概念联系起来，不足以处理安全关键行为。

Method: 提出Safe-SAIL框架，系统识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE，解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略扩展解释过程。将发布包含SAE检查点和人类可读神经元解释的全面工具包。

Result: 该框架能够提取丰富多样的安全相关特征，有效捕捉高风险行为，如生成有毒响应和违反安全规定。

Conclusion: Safe-SAIL支持对安全风险进行实证分析，促进LLM安全研究，为解决LLM部署中的安全担忧提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

Result: 三个示例表明该方法在保持计算效率的同时，比忽略模型不确定性的传统方法产生更可信的预测结果

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理机器学习代理模型中的不确定性耦合问题，为可靠性分析提供更准确的预测

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly employed to replace expensive
computational models for physics-based reliability analysis. However, their use
introduces epistemic uncertainty from model approximation errors, which couples
with aleatory uncertainty in model inputs, potentially compromising the
accuracy of reliability predictions. This study proposes a Gauss-Hermite
quadrature approach to decouple these nested uncertainties and enable more
accurate reliability analysis. The method evaluates conditional failure
probabilities under aleatory uncertainty using First and Second Order
Reliability Methods and then integrates these probabilities across realizations
of epistemic uncertainty. Three examples demonstrate that the proposed approach
maintains computational efficiency while yielding more trustworthy predictions
than traditional methods that ignore model uncertainty.

*Zijie Zhou,Huichen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合STL时间序列分解和GRU神经网络的模型，用于预测地铁换乘客流量，相比现有方法显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地铁智能交通系统中，准确的换乘客流量预测是优化运营计划和提升运输效率的关键环节，需要改进现有预测理论以支持智能运营决策。

Method: 模型首先使用Keras构建和训练GRU模型，然后预处理地铁刷卡数据，使用基于图的深度优先搜索算法识别乘客出行路径，构建换乘客流量时间序列，采用STL算法将时间序列分解为趋势、周期和残差分量，使用3σ原则处理异常值，最后完成预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，与LSTM、GRU和STL-LSTM模型相比，STL-GRU组合模型在工作日（除周五外）、周五和休息日的预测精度显著提高，MAPE分别降低了至少2.3、1.36和6.42个百分点。

Conclusion: STL-GRU组合预测模型能够有效提高地铁换乘客流量的预测精度，为地铁智能运营决策提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: In the metro intelligent transportation system, accurate transfer passenger
flow prediction is a key link in optimizing operation plans and improving
transportation efficiency. To further improve the theory of metro internal
transfer passenger flow prediction and provide more reliable support for
intelligent operation decisions, this paper innovatively proposes a metro
transfer passenger flow prediction model that integrates the Seasonal and Trend
decomposition using Loess (STL) method and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).In
practical application, the model first relies on the deep learning library
Keras to complete the construction and training of the GRU model, laying the
foundation for subsequent prediction; then preprocesses the original metro card
swiping data, uses the graph-based depth-first search algorithm to identify
passengers' travel paths, and further constructs the transfer passenger flow
time series; subsequently adopts the STL time series decomposition algorithm to
decompose the constructed transfer passenger flow time series into trend
component, periodic component and residual component, and uses the 3{\sigma}
principle to eliminate and fill the outliers in the residual component, and
finally completes the transfer passenger flow prediction.Taking the transfer
passenger flow data of a certain metro station as the research sample, the
validity of the model is verified. The results show that compared with Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the combined model of
STL time series decomposition method and Long Short-Term Memory (STL-LSTM), the
STL-GRU combined prediction model significantly improves the prediction
accuracy of transfer passenger flow on weekdays (excluding Fridays), Fridays
and rest days, with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the prediction
results reduced by at least 2.3, 1.36 and 6.42 percentage points respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，基于Transformer的机器学习应用在解决物理问题时，其权重矩阵呈现随机性特征，与物理问题的数学结构没有直接可识别联系，这表明机器学习与科学方法可能是两种不同但互补的知识获取路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习（特别是Transformer架构）在解决物理问题时的内在工作机制，以及其权重矩阵与物理结构之间的关系，旨在理解机器学习是否能够提供与传统科学方法不同的知识获取方式。

Method: 分析Transformer模型在解决两个代表性物理应用时的权重矩阵特性，观察其是否呈现随机性特征，并与物理问题的数学结构进行对比。

Result: 发现权重矩阵具有随机性特征，与物理问题的结构和数学形式没有直接可识别联系，但Transformer的操作可能与广义路径积分技术有相似之处。

Conclusion: 机器学习和科学方法可能是互补的知识获取路径，但严格的解释性（即网络参数与物理结构之间的直接对应）可能难以实现，需要警惕在没有洞察力的情况下获取知识的风险。

Abstract: It is shown that the weight matrices of transformer-based machine learning
applications to the solution of two representative physical applications show a
random-like character which bears no directly recognizable link to the physical
and mathematical structure of the physical problem under study. This suggests
that machine learning and the scientific method may represent two distinct and
potentially complementary paths to knowledge, even though a strict notion of
explainability in terms of direct correspondence between network parameters and
physical structures may remain out of reach. It is also observed that drawing a
parallel between transformer operation and (generalized) path-integration
techniques may account for the random-like nature of the weights, but still
does not resolve the tension with explainability. We conclude with some general
comments on the hazards of gleaning knowledge without the benefit of Insight.

TL;DR: MoE-CL是一个参数高效的对抗性专家混合框架，用于工业规模的大语言模型持续指令调优，通过双专家设计解决灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实工业环境中，大语言模型需要持续学习以适应多样化和不断演化的任务，但现有的持续学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，即训练新任务会降低对早期任务的性能。

Method: 采用双专家设计：每个任务专用的LoRA专家通过参数独立性保留任务特定知识；共享的LoRA专家实现跨任务迁移。通过任务感知判别器的对抗学习，共享专家只传递任务对齐信息。

Result: 在公开MTL5基准和工业Tencent3基准上的实验验证了MoE-CL的有效性。在腾讯视频平台的内容合规审查A/B测试中，MoE-CL将人工审核成本降低了15.3%。

Conclusion: MoE-CL在大规模工业部署中具有实用性，能够实现持续适应和稳定迁移，支持大语言模型的自进化。

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn
continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring
self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However,
existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter
isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks
degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and
weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial
mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual
instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated
LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter
independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable
cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the
shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The
discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned
information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the
shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the
discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing
knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting
self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an
industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for
continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance
review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by
15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale
industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are
critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度跟踪技术虽然能提高分布式优化的收敛速度，但存在固有的隐私泄露风险，需要保护智能体在优化过程中的私有信息免受潜在攻击者的侵害。

Method: 提出加权梯度跟踪分布式隐私保护算法，使用衰减权重因子来消除梯度跟踪中的隐私泄露风险，并在时变异构步长条件下分析算法的收敛性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy-preserving distributed optimization
problem, aiming to protect agents' private information from potential attackers
during the optimization process. Gradient tracking, an advanced technique for
improving the convergence rate in distributed optimization, has been applied to
most first-order algorithms in recent years. We first reveal the inherent
privacy leakage risk associated with gradient tracking. Building upon this
insight, we propose a weighted gradient tracking distributed privacy-preserving
algorithm, eliminating the privacy leakage risk in gradient tracking using
decaying weight factors. Then, we characterize the convergence of the proposed
algorithm under time-varying heterogeneous step sizes. We prove the proposed
algorithm converges precisely to the optimal solution under mild assumptions.
Finally, numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness through a
classical distributed estimation problem and the distributed training of a
convolutional neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的静态-动态图融合网络（SDGF），通过双路径图结构学习方法捕获多尺度时间序列间的相关性，解决了现有方法难以建模复杂动态跨尺度依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，序列间的相关性对于准确性至关重要，但这些关系在不同时间尺度上表现出复杂的动态特性。现有方法在建模这些多尺度依赖关系方面存在局限，难以捕捉其复杂且演化的本质。

Method: SDGF模型采用双路径图结构学习方法：使用基于先验知识的静态图锚定长期稳定依赖关系，同时利用多级小波分解提取多尺度特征构建自适应学习的动态图。设计了注意力门控模块智能融合这两种互补信息源，并使用多核扩张卷积网络加深对时间模式的理解。

Conclusion: SDGF模型通过静态-动态图融合机制成功捕获了多尺度时间序列间的复杂依赖关系，在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Inter-series correlations are crucial for accurate multivariate time series
forecasting, yet these relationships often exhibit complex dynamics across
different temporal scales. Existing methods are limited in modeling these
multi-scale dependencies and struggle to capture their intricate and evolving
nature. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Static-Dynamic
Graph Fusion network (SDGF), whose core lies in capturing multi-scale
inter-series correlations through a dual-path graph structure learning
approach. Specifically, the model utilizes a static graph based on prior
knowledge to anchor long-term, stable dependencies, while concurrently
employing Multi-level Wavelet Decomposition to extract multi-scale features for
constructing an adaptively learned dynamic graph to capture associations at
different scales. We design an attention-gated module to fuse these two
complementary sources of information intelligently, and a multi-kernel dilated
convolutional network is then used to deepen the understanding of temporal
patterns. Comprehensive experiments on multiple widely used real-world
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

LLMs and an exploration of potential future trends. We then analyze how various
structural choices impact performance across benchmarks and further corroborate
our findings using mechanistic interpretability techniques. By providing
data-driven insights into LLM optimization, our work aims to guide the targeted
development and application of future models. We will release our dataset at

TL;DR: 提出了LoRALib统一基准，用于公平比较不同的LoRA-MoE方法，通过标准化数据集和超参数，在17种模型架构上生成了680个LoRA模块，并进行了大规模实验评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA-MoE方法在模型、数据集、超参数和评估方法上缺乏统一标准，难以进行公平比较，需要建立一个统一的基准来系统评估不同方法的性能。

Method: 将40个下游任务的数据集标准化为统一格式，使用相同超参数进行微调，获得680个LoRA模块。基于此LoRA库，使用OpenCompass测试工具对3种代表性LoRA-MoE方法和不同LoRA选择机制进行大规模实验。

Result: 实验表明LoRAMoE方法表现最佳，优先选择与目标任务相关的LoRA可以进一步提升MoE的性能。

Conclusion: 建立了LoRALib统一基准，为未来LoRA-MoE方法的研究提供了公平比较的基础，并发现任务相关的LoRA选择策略能有效提升性能。

Abstract: As a parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) can save significant costs in storage and computing, but its strong
adaptability to a single task is often accompanied by insufficient cross-task
generalization capabilities. To improve this, existing work combines LoRA with
mixture-of-experts (MoE) to enhance the model's adaptability through expert
modules and routing mechanisms. However, existing LoRA-MoE methods lack unified
standards in models, datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation methods, making
it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods. To this
end, we proposed a unified benchmark named LoRALib. Specifically, we
standardized datasets from $40$ downstream tasks into a unified format,
fine-tuned them using the same hyperparameters and obtained $680$ LoRA modules
across $17$ model architectures. Based on this LoRA library, we conduct
large-scale experiments on $3$ representative LoRA-MoE methods and different
LoRA selection mechanisms using the open-sourced testing tool OpenCompass.
Extensive experiments show that LoRAMoE performs best, and that prioritizing
LoRAs relevant to the target task can further improve the performance of MoE.
We hope these findings will inspire future work. Our datasets and LoRA library
are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/YaoLuzjut/LoRAOcean_dataset

Motivation: 现有方法在专家身份上操作，而RIPLM旨在直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中更新，以保持与秩基准的等价性。

Method: RIPLM算法利用秩基准与分布基准的结构等价性，直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中更新，确保算法的分布始终在秩诱导分布类中。

Result: RIPLM是第一个在睡眠专家设置中既保持秩忠实性又具有方差自适应性的算法。

Conclusion: RIPLM通过直接在秩诱导的Plackett-Luce参数化中更新，实现了秩忠实性和方差自适应性，为睡眠专家设置提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm, \emph{Rank-Induced Plackett--Luce Mirror
Descent (RIPLM)}, which leverages the structural equivalence between the
\emph{rank benchmark} and the \emph{distributional benchmark} established in
\citet{BergamOzcanHsu2022}. Unlike prior approaches that operate on expert
identities, RIPLM updates directly in the \emph{rank-induced Plackett--Luce
(PL)} parameterization. This ensures that the algorithm's played distributions
remain within the class of rank-induced distributions at every round,
preserving the equivalence with the rank benchmark. To our knowledge, RIPLM is
the first algorithm that is both (i) \emph{rank-faithful} and (ii)
\emph{variance-adaptive} in the sleeping experts setting.

TL;DR: 本文比较了规则分类器FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务中的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的性能。研究发现FOLD-SE在保持可解释性的同时，性能损失很小，能够有效平衡准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对兼具准确性、效率和可解释性的机器学习模型需求增长，需要研究如何在保持高性能的同时提供透明的预测依据。传统模型如神经网络在复杂数据集上准确性高但缺乏内部透明度。

Method: 使用分类数据集，以准确率、F1分数和处理时间作为主要性能指标，比较FOLD-SE与FOLD-R++在二分类任务的表现，以及FOLD-SE与XGBoost在多分类任务中的表现。

Result: FOLD-SE在二分类中比FOLD-R++提供更少的规则，仅损失少量准确性和处理效率；在多分类中比XGBoost更精确高效，同时生成可理解的规则集。

Conclusion: FOLD-SE等基于规则的方法能够弥合可解释性和性能之间的差距，是多样化分类任务中黑盒模型的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Recently, the demand for Machine Learning (ML) models that can balance
accuracy, efficiency, and interpreability has grown significantly.
Traditionally, there has been a tradeoff between accuracy and explainability in
predictive models, with models such as Neural Networks achieving high accuracy
on complex datasets while sacrificing internal transparency. As such, new
rule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible
justification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The
primary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both
rule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE
performs against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to
multi-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can
generate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose
upwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with
XGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The
research used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,
and processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that
FOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering
fewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in
processing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE
is more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to
generating a comprehensible rule set. The results point out that FOLD-SE is a
better choice for both binary tasks and classifications with multiple
categories. Therefore, these results demonstrate that rule-based approaches
like FOLD-SE can bridge the gap between explainability and performance,
highlighting their potential as viable alternatives to black-box models in
diverse classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为代谢疾病的早期检测和靶向干预提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案，推动了精准医学在代谢疾病领域的应用。

Abstract: Metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent
a significant global health burden, disproportionately impacting genetically
predisposed populations such as the Pima Indians (a Native American tribe from
south central Arizona). This study introduces a novel machine learning (ML)
framework that integrates predictive modeling with gene-agnostic pathway
mapping to identify high-risk individuals and uncover potential therapeutic
targets. Using the Pima Indian dataset, logistic regression and t-tests were
applied to identify key predictors of T2DM, yielding an overall model accuracy
of 78.43%. To bridge predictive analytics with biological relevance, we
developed a pathway mapping strategy that links identified predictors to
critical signaling networks, including insulin signaling, AMPK, and PPAR
pathways. This approach provides mechanistic insights without requiring direct
molecular data. Building upon these connections, we propose therapeutic
strategies such as dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, AMPK activators, SIRT1
modulators, and phytochemical, further validated through pathway enrichment
analyses. Overall, this framework advances precision medicine by offering
interpretable and scalable solutions for early detection and targeted
intervention in metabolic disorders. The key contributions of this work are:
(1) development of an ML framework combining logistic regression and principal
component analysis (PCA) for T2DM risk prediction; (2) introduction of a
gene-agnostic pathway mapping approach to generate mechanistic insights; and
(3) identification of novel therapeutic strategies tailored for high-risk
populations.

Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots
provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research.
However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is
error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop
KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD
directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility.
KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered
by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD
without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture
automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows
and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility,
KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI
assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring
programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and
real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To
illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer
immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and
biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes
and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical
research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream
analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

Motivation: 时空数据常因传感器故障等原因存在缺失值。虽然扩散模型在时空填补任务中表现出色，但现有方法在提取时空依赖关系时存在误差累积问题，且忽略了不同扩散步骤中噪声数据的依赖关系变化。

Method: 提出AdaSTI框架，包含：1）基于双向S4模型的BiS4PI网络进行预填补；2）时空条件化器（STC）网络提取条件信息；3）具有门控注意力机制的噪声感知时空（NAST）网络捕获不同扩散步骤的依赖关系变化。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data abounds in domain like traffic and environmental
monitoring. However, it often suffers from missing values due to sensor
malfunctions, transmission failures, etc. Recent years have seen continued
efforts to improve spatio-temporal data imputation performance. Recently
diffusion models have outperformed other approaches in various tasks, including
spatio-temporal imputation, showing competitive performance. Extracting and
utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies as conditional information is vital in
diffusion-based methods. However, previous methods introduce error accumulation
in this process and ignore the variability of the dependencies in the noisy
data at different diffusion steps. In this paper, we propose AdaSTI (Adaptive
Dependency Model in Diffusion-based Spatio-Temporal Imputation), a novel
spatio-temporal imputation approach based on conditional diffusion model.
Inside AdaSTI, we propose a BiS4PI network based on a bi-directional S4 model
for pre-imputation with the imputed result used to extract conditional
information by our designed Spatio-Temporal Conditionalizer (STC)network. We
also propose a Noise-Aware Spatio-Temporal (NAST) network with a gated
attention mechanism to capture the variant dependencies across diffusion steps.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that AdaSTI outperforms
existing methods in all the settings, with up to 46.4% reduction in imputation
error.

Result: XGBoost表现最佳，F1分数分别为：呼吸0.66、血流动力学0.72、肾功能0.76、神经系统0.62，优于基线模型。特征分析显示呼吸频率、血压和肌酐等临床相关参数是最有影响力的预测因子。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在不需复杂时间序列建模或自然语言处理的情况下，实现早期、可解释临床警报的实际潜力。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping
signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care.
Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their
focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of
clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to
predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure,
hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration,
using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are
defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for
example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg,
creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale
score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and
include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We
train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU
stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation
metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss.
XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory,
0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration,
outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant
parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the
most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the
CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early,
interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or
natural language processing.

*Xinyu Mu,Hui Dou,Furao Shen,Jian Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConceptFlow是一个基于概念的CNN可解释性框架，通过追踪概念在层间的传播来模拟模型的内部"思考路径"，包含概念注意力和概念通路两个关键组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了单个滤波器的语义角色和概念在层间的动态传播，无法提供对CNN内部推理的深入理解。

Method: 提出ConceptFlow框架：1）概念注意力将每个滤波器与相关高级概念关联；2）概念通路通过概念转移矩阵量化概念在滤波器间的传播和转换。

Result: 实验结果表明ConceptFlow能产生语义上有意义的模型推理洞察，验证了概念注意力和概念通路在解释决策行为方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ConceptFlow通过建模分层概念通路，为CNN内部逻辑提供更深入的理解，支持生成更忠实且与人类对齐的解释。

Abstract: Concept-based interpretability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) aims
to align internal model representations with high-level semantic concepts, but
existing approaches largely overlook the semantic roles of individual filters
and the dynamic propagation of concepts across layers. To address these
limitations, we propose ConceptFlow, a concept-based interpretability framework
that simulates the internal "thinking path" of a model by tracing how concepts
emerge and evolve across layers. ConceptFlow comprises two key components: (i)
concept attentions, which associate each filter with relevant high-level
concepts to enable localized semantic interpretation, and (ii) conceptual
pathways, derived from a concept transition matrix that quantifies how concepts
propagate and transform between filters. Together, these components offer a
unified and structured view of internal model reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that ConceptFlow yields semantically meaningful insights into model
reasoning, validating the effectiveness of concept attentions and conceptual
pathways in explaining decision behavior. By modeling hierarchical conceptual
pathways, ConceptFlow provides deeper insight into the internal logic of CNNs
and supports the generation of more faithful and human-aligned explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏表示的训练高效框架STS，通过视觉令牌压缩器和层动态跳过器来减少多模态大语言模型的训练计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练效率低下，主要由于多模态数据引入的长输入序列和层间计算利用率低的问题

Method: STS框架包含两个关键组件：视觉令牌压缩器（减少视觉令牌信息负载）和层动态跳过器（在前后向传播中动态跳过语言模型的不必要层）

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中进行了广泛评估，证明了其有效性和效率

Conclusion: 该稀疏训练方案适用于多种MLLM架构，能够显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a variety of domains. However, training MLLMs is often
inefficient due to the significantly longer input sequences introduced by
multimodal data and the low utilization of inter-layer computations. To address
this challenge, we shift the focus to the training process itself and propose a
novel training-efficient framework based on sparse representations, termed the
Sparse Training Scheme (STS). This scheme consists of two key components: the
Visual Token Compressor, which reduces the information load by compressing
visual tokens, and the Layer Dynamic Skipper, which mitigates the computational
overhead by dynamically skipping unnecessary layers in the language model
during both forward and backward passes. Our approach is broadly applicable to
diverse MLLM architectures and has been extensively evaluated on multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索中的性能评估耗时严重，现有神经预测器由于难以捕捉架构间复杂关系而泛化能力差

Method: HyperNAS包含全局编码方案（捕捉宏观结构信息）和共享超网络（增强架构间模式研究），并采用动态自适应多任务损失确保训练稳定性

Result: 在5个代表性搜索空间上验证，HyperNAS在少量样本场景下表现优异，CIFAR-10上达到97.60% top-1准确率，ImageNet上达到82.4% top-1准确率，样本使用量减少至少5倍

Conclusion: HyperNAS在神经架构搜索预测器方面取得了显著进展，特别是在少量样本情况下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Time-intensive performance evaluations significantly impede progress in
Neural Architecture Search (NAS). To address this, neural predictors leverage
surrogate models trained on proxy datasets, allowing for direct performance
predictions for new architectures. However, these predictors often exhibit poor
generalization due to their limited ability to capture intricate relationships
among various architectures. In this paper, we propose HyperNAS, a novel neural
predictor paradigm for enhancing architecture representation learning. HyperNAS
consists of two primary components: a global encoding scheme and a shared
hypernetwork. The global encoding scheme is devised to capture the
comprehensive macro-structure information, while the shared hypernetwork serves
as an auxiliary task to enhance the investigation of inter-architecture
patterns. To ensure training stability, we further develop a dynamic adaptive
multi-task loss to facilitate personalized exploration on the Pareto front.
Extensive experiments across five representative search spaces, including ViTs,
demonstrate the advantages of HyperNAS, particularly in few-shot scenarios. For
instance, HyperNAS strikes new state-of-the-art results, with 97.60\% top-1
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 82.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, using at least
5.0$\times$ fewer samples.

TL;DR: WLFM是一个用于测井解释的基础模型，通过三阶段训练方法在1200口井的多曲线测井数据上进行预训练，在孔隙度估计和岩性分类等任务上优于现有基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测井解释对于地下特征描述至关重要，但面临工具响应异构、信号噪声和标签有限等挑战，需要开发更强大的基础模型。

Method: 三阶段方法：1）将测井片段标记化为地质标记；2）使用掩码标记建模和地层感知对比学习进行自监督预训练；3）通过少样本微调进行多任务适应。

Result: WLFM在孔隙度估计上达到0.0041 MSE，岩性分类准确率74.13%；微调后进一步提升至0.0038 MSE和78.10%准确率。模型展现出地层感知能力和可重用地质词汇表。

Conclusion: WLFM为地质AI提供了可扩展、可解释和可转移的骨干网络，为测井、地震和文本数据的多模态集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Well-log interpretation is fundamental for subsurface characterization but
remains challenged by heterogeneous tool responses, noisy signals, and limited
labels. We propose WLFM, a foundation model pretrained on multi-curve logs from
1200 wells, comprising three stages: tokenization of log patches into
geological tokens, self-supervised pretraining with masked-token modeling and
stratigraphy-aware contrastive learning, and multi-task adaptation with
few-shot fine-tuning. WLFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving 0.0041 MSE in porosity estimation and 74.13\% accuracy in lithology
classification, while WLFM-Finetune further improves to 0.0038 MSE and 78.10\%
accuracy. Beyond predictive accuracy, WLFM exhibits emergent layer-awareness,
learns a reusable geological vocabulary, and reconstructs masked curves with
reasonable fidelity, though systematic offsets are observed in shallow and
ultra-deep intervals. Although boundary detection is not explicitly evaluated
here, clustering analyses suggest strong potential for future extension. These
results establish WLFM as a scalable, interpretable, and transferable backbone
for geological AI, with implications for multi-modal integration of logs,
seismic, and textual data.

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度强化学习统一生成、评分和多目标优化，可在数小时内快速产生多样化、高效的候选抗生素肽。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths
annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we
present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of
antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with
reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data
to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal
policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a
learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable
physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed
low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit
rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules
killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By
unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep
reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces
diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics
and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within
hours.

efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible
and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B

introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and
training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact

Motivation: 传统的激活函数（如ReLU、tanh、sigmoid）是经验验证的静态函数，通过优化激活函数的形状，可以训练出更参数高效和准确的模型。

Method: 使用参数化线性B样条激活函数，提出并比较9种训练方法，探索神经网络中的双重优化动态。

Result: 实验结果显示，在FNN中实现了高达94%的错误率降低，在CNN中实现了51%的错误率降低，相比传统的基于ReLU的模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化激活函数形状可以获得显著的性能提升，但需要付出额外的开发训练复杂度和模型延迟的代价。

Abstract: Activation functions in neural networks are typically selected from a set of
empirically validated, commonly used static functions such as ReLU, tanh, or
sigmoid. However, by optimizing the shapes of a network's activation functions,
we can train models that are more parameter-efficient and accurate by assigning
more optimal activations to the neurons. In this paper, I present and compare 9
training methodologies to explore dual-optimization dynamics in neural networks
with parameterized linear B-spline activation functions. The experiments
realize up to 94% lower end model error rates in FNNs and 51% lower rates in
CNNs compared to traditional ReLU-based models. These gains come at the cost of
additional development and training complexity as well as end model latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带电池管理的卡车-无人机协同配送问题，现有方法在无人机调度和电池约束处理方面存在优化空间，需要更智能的调度策略来平衡卡车等待时间和无人机飞行时间。

Method: 混合强化学习方法：ALNS算法优化卡车路径（使用2/3-opt和Or-opt操作），配合基于指针/注意力机制的小型策略网络调度无人机任务。策略网络解码发射-服务-会合三元组，使用硬可行性掩码处理续航约束和充电需求，通过精确时间线模拟器计算实际完成时间。

Result: 在N=50、E=0.7、R=0.1的欧几里得实例上，平均完成时间为5.203±0.093，相比ALNS的5.349±0.038提升了2.73%，与NN方法的5.208±0.124相当（仅差0.10%）。RL调度器在所有实例上都不差于ALNS，在三分之二的种子上达到或超过NN性能。

Conclusion: 学习的调度器能够有效平衡卡车等待时间和无人机飞行时间，最小化总完成时间。该方法为带电池约束的卡车-无人机协同配送提供了有效的解决方案，并提供了可复现的实现框架。

Abstract: We study last-mile delivery with one truck and one drone under explicit
battery management: the drone flies at twice the truck speed; each sortie must
satisfy an endurance budget; after every delivery the drone recharges on the
truck before the next launch. We introduce a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL)
solver that couples an ALNS-based truck tour (with 2/3-opt and Or-opt) with a
small pointer/attention policy that schedules drone sorties. The policy decodes
launch--serve--rendezvous triplets with hard feasibility masks for endurance
and post-delivery recharge; a fast, exact timeline simulator enforces
launch/recovery handling and computes the true makespan used by masked
greedy/beam decoding. On Euclidean instances with $N{=}50$, $E{=}0.7$, and
$R{=}0.1$, the method achieves an average makespan of \textbf{5.203}$\pm$0.093,
versus \textbf{5.349}$\pm$0.038 for ALNS and \textbf{5.208}$\pm$0.124 for NN --
i.e., \textbf{2.73\%} better than ALNS on average and within \textbf{0.10\%} of
NN. Per-seed, the RL scheduler never underperforms ALNS on the same instance
and ties or beats NN on two of three seeds. A decomposition of the makespan
shows the expected truck--wait trade-off across heuristics; the learned
scheduler balances both to minimize the total completion time. We provide a
config-first implementation with plotting and significance-test utilities to
support replication.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a new architecture
following auto regressive models. Their denoising process offers a powerful
generative advantage, but they present significant challenges in learning and
understanding numerically sensitive mathematical and order-sensitive logical
tasks. Current training methods, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and
reinforcement learning, focus primarily on improving general knowledge
retention and reasoning abilities, but lack a comprehensive understanding of
mathematical and logical patterns. We propose DSFT, a simple yet effective
Diffusion SFT strategy, by adjusting the masking strategy and loss function,
guiding models to understand mathematical and logical patterns. This strategy
can be flexibly combined with pre-training, reinforcement learning, and other
training methods. Validated on models such as LLaDA and Dream series, we prove
that DSFT on small-scale data can achieve improvements of 5-10% and
approximately 2% on mathematical and logical problems, respectively. This
inspiring masking approach offers insights for future learning of specific
patterns, which can be easily and efficiently combined with other training
methods and applied to various dLLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, future
mobile networks will offer vast services and resources for commuting,
production, daily life, and entertainment. Accurate and efficient forecasting
of mobile data (e.g., cell traffic, user behavior, channel quality) helps
operators monitor network state changes, orchestrate wireless resources, and
schedule infrastructure and users, thereby improving supply efficiency and
service quality. However, current forecasting paradigms rely on customized
designs with tailored models for exclusive data types. Such approaches increase
complexity and deployment costs under large-scale, heterogeneous networks
involving base stations, users, and channels. In this paper, we design a
foundation model for mobile data forecasting, MobiGPT, with a unified structure
capable of forecasting three data types: base station traffic, user app usage,
and channel quality. We propose a soft-prompt learning method to help the model
understand features of different data types, and introduce a temporal masking
mechanism to guide the model through three forecasting tasks: short-term
prediction, long-term prediction, and distribution generation, supporting
diverse optimization scenarios. Evaluations on real-world datasets with over
100,000 samples show that MobiGPT achieves accurate multi-type forecasting.
Compared to existing models, it improves forecasting accuracy by 27.37%,
20.08%, and 7.27%, reflecting strong generalization. Moreover, MobiGPT exhibits
superior zero/few-shot performance in unseen scenarios, with over 21.51%
improvement, validating its strong transferability as a foundation model.

Conclusion: PiMoE为下一代科学或工业智能系统提供了高效、可解释和可扩展的范式

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

TL;DR: FedIA框架通过投影优先策略解决联邦图学习中领域偏移导致的梯度噪声问题，使用重要性感知的两阶段管道来降噪客户端更新，实现更稳定收敛和更高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习在领域偏移下（如Twitch Gamers和多语言Wikipedia网络）会导致客户端模型表示不兼容，使朴素聚合方法不稳定且无效。研究发现问题根源在于梯度信号中的噪声，而非权重方案。

Method: 提出FedIA框架，采用投影优先策略：1）服务器端top-ρ掩码保留约5%最具信息量的坐标；2）轻量级影响力正则化动量权重抑制异常客户端。该方法不增加上行流量，服务器内存开销可忽略。

Result: 在Twitch Gamers（同质）和Wikipedia（异质）图上，FedIA相比9个强基线方法实现了更平滑稳定的收敛和更高的最终准确率。收敛分析显示动态投影保持了最优的O(σ²/√T)收敛速率。

Conclusion: FedIA通过重要性感知的投影优先策略有效解决了联邦图学习中的梯度噪声问题，提供了一种高效可部署的解决方案，在真实场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) under domain skew -- as observed on platforms
such as \emph{Twitch Gamers} and multilingual \emph{Wikipedia} networks --
drives client models toward incompatible representations, rendering naive
aggregation both unstable and ineffective. We find that the culprit is not the
weighting scheme but the \emph{noisy gradient signal}: empirical analysis of
baseline methods suggests that a vast majority of gradient dimensions can be
dominated by domain-specific variance. We therefore shift focus from
"aggregation-first" to a \emph{projection-first} strategy that denoises client
updates \emph{before} they are combined. The proposed FedIA framework realises
this \underline{I}mportance-\underline{A}ware idea through a two-stage,
plug-and-play pipeline: (i) a server-side top-$\rho$ mask keeps only the most
informative about 5% of coordinates, and (ii) a lightweight
influence-regularised momentum weight suppresses outlier clients. FedIA adds
\emph{no extra uplink traffic and only negligible server memory}, making it
readily deployable. On both homogeneous (Twitch Gamers) and heterogeneous
(Wikipedia) graphs, it yields smoother, more stable convergence and higher
final accuracy than nine strong baselines. A convergence sketch further shows
that dynamic projection maintains the optimal

*Wonjun Bang,Jongseok Park,Hongseung Yu,Kyungmin Bin,Kyunghan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBVR是一种新颖的大语言模型量化方法，通过高斯分布的位向量表示实现硬件友好的快速推理，在4位量化下比FP16模型快2.21-3.04倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法存在局限性：RTN方法无法处理LLM权重的高斯分布特性，而基于码本的方法虽然考虑了分布但存在内存访问模式问题导致推理速度下降

Method: 提出SBVR方法，将权重值映射到非均匀表示点，其分布遵循LLM权重的实际高斯分布；设计定制CUDA内核，无需解压缩即可在SBVR格式下直接执行矩阵向量乘法

Result: 在各种模型上的评估显示，SBVR在困惑度和准确率基准测试中达到最先进性能，在4位量化下比FP16模型快2.21-3.04倍

Conclusion: SBVR方法成功解决了现有量化方法在准确性和推理速度之间的权衡问题，实现了既保持模型质量又显著提升推理效率的目标

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), numerous Post-Training
Quantization (PTQ) strategies have been proposed to alleviate deployment
barriers created by their enormous parameter counts. Quantization achieves
compression by limiting the number of representable points in the data.
Therefore, the key to achieving efficient quantization is selecting the optimal
combination of representation points, or codes, for the given data. Existing
PTQ solutions adopt two major approaches to this problem: Round-To-Nearest
(RTN)-based methods and codebook-based methods. RTN-based methods map LLM
weights onto uniformly distributed integer grids, failing to account for the
Gaussian-like weight distribution of LLM weights. Codebook-based methods
mitigate this issue by constructing distribution-aware codebooks; however, they
suffer from random and strided memory access patterns, resulting in degraded
inference speed that is exacerbated by the limited size of GPU L1 cache. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM quantization method, SBVR
(Summation of BitVector Representation), that enables Gaussian-like code
representation in a hardware-friendly manner for fast inference. SBVR maps
weight values to non-uniform representation points whose distribution follows
the actual distribution of LLM weights, enabling more accurate compression.
Additionally, we design a custom CUDA kernel that allows matrix-vector
multiplication directly in the SBVR format without decompression, thereby
enabling high-performance execution of SBVR-compressed models. Our evaluations
of SBVR on various models demonstrate state-of-the-art perplexity and accuracy
benchmark performance while delivering a 2.21x- 3.04x end-to-end
token-generation speedup over naive FP16 models in the 4-bit quantization
regime.

Motivation: 人类能够通过自然语言理解地理空间信息，但LLM的地理空间认知能力尚未充分探索。先前研究受限于不可量化的指标、有限的数据集和不明确的研究层次。

Method: 创建了包含12个全球大都市36000条路线的大规模数据集；开发了PathBuilder工具，实现自然语言指令与导航路线的双向转换；提出了新的评估框架和指标来评估LLM的路线反转能力。

Result: LLM在路线反转任务上表现有限：大多数反转路线既没有返回起点，也与最优路线不相似；LLM面临路线生成鲁棒性低和对错误答案置信度高的问题。

Conclusion: LLM在地理空间路线认知方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进模型的地理空间理解能力。

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

TL;DR: 提出多模态思维链（MCoT）框架，用于解决对话导航中的自我中心到全局中心的空间方向推理问题，在中文对话环境中实现了高精度方向识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内或复杂环境中GPS信号弱、详细地图不可用时，对话代理需要将自我中心表述转换为全局方向的问题，特别是在非英语和语音识别场景下的挑战

Method: 提出多模态思维链框架，整合语音识别文本和地标坐标，通过三步推理过程：提取空间关系、坐标映射到绝对方向、推断用户朝向，并采用课程学习策略在中等规模模型上训练

Result: MCoT在清晰文本上达到100%方向准确率，在语音识别文本上达到98.1%，显著优于单模态和非结构化基线，在多语言代码切换和噪声条件下表现鲁棒

Conclusion: 结构化MCoT空间推理为可解释和资源高效的具身导航提供了可行路径，展示了在跨域评估中对语言变异、领域转移和指代模糊的强韧性

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在所有数据集上一致优于现有方法，通过选择性利用任务向量中最可靠和信息丰富的组件实现更好性能

Conclusion: 该方法为高效有效的任务向量组合设立了新标准，具有重要的实用价值

Abstract: Task vectors capture how a model changes during fine-tuning by recording the
difference between pre-trained and task-specific weights. The composition of
task vectors, a key operator in task arithmetic, enables models to integrate
knowledge from multiple tasks without incurring additional inference costs. In
this paper, we propose variational task vector composition, where composition
coefficients are taken as latent variables and estimated in a Bayesian
inference framework. Unlike previous methods that operate at the task level,
our framework focuses on sample-specific composition. Motivated by the
observation of structural redundancy in task vectors, we introduce a
Spike-and-Slab prior that promotes sparsity and preserves only the most
informative components. To further address the high variance and sampling
inefficiency in sparse, high-dimensional spaces, we develop a gated sampling
mechanism that constructs a controllable posterior by filtering the composition
coefficients based on both uncertainty and importance. This yields a more
stable and interpretable variational framework by deterministically selecting
reliable task components, reducing sampling variance while improving
transparency and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets by
selectively leveraging the most reliable and informative components in task
vectors. These findings highlight the practical value of our approach,
establishing a new standard for efficient and effective task vector
composition.

Result: 在7个基准测试中平均实现2.03倍加速，比标准MTP性能提升82%，保持无损输出质量

Conclusion: FastMTP仅需轻量级训练，可无缝集成现有推理框架，为LLM推理加速提供实用解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential
nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck
that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has
demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance,
its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored.
This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves
multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern,
significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach
fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled
data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and
maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By
integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we
further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental
results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an
average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with
lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires
only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference
frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for
accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in distributed swarm learning (DSL) offer a promising
paradigm for edge Internet of Things. Such advancements enhance data privacy,
communication efficiency, energy saving, and model scalability. However, the
presence of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data pose
a significant challenge for multi-access edge computing, degrading learning
performance and diverging training behavior of vanilla DSL. Further, there
still lacks theoretical guidance on how data heterogeneity affects model
training accuracy, which requires thorough investigation. To fill the gap, this
paper first study the data heterogeneity by measuring the impact of non-i.i.d.
datasets under the DSL framework. This then motivates a new multi-worker
selection design for DSL, termed M-DSL algorithm, which works effectively with
distributed heterogeneous data. A new non-i.i.d. degree metric is introduced
and defined in this work to formulate the statistical difference among local
datasets, which builds a connection between the measure of data heterogeneity
and the evaluation of DSL performance. In this way, our M-DSL guides effective
selection of multiple works who make prominent contributions for global model
updates. We also provide theoretical analysis on the convergence behavior of
our M-DSL, followed by extensive experiments on different heterogeneous
datasets and non-i.i.d. data settings. Numerical results verify performance
improvement and network intelligence enhancement provided by our M-DSL beyond
the benchmarks.

TL;DR: GnnXemplar是一种新颖的全局解释方法，通过识别GNN嵌入空间中的代表性节点（范例），并使用从这些节点邻域导出的自然语言规则来解释预测，解决了现有全局解释方法在大型真实世界图数据中的局限性。

Conclusion: GnnXemplar为图神经网络的全局解释提供了一种新颖且有效的方法，特别适用于大规模真实世界图数据，通过结合范例理论和LLM技术实现了更好的解释性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet
their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local
explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation
methods, those that characterize an entire class, remain underdeveloped.
Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach
that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is
rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex
structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global
explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar
identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space, exemplars, and
explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their
neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem
over reverse k-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy
approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt
strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse
benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in
fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study
with 60 participants.

Motivation: 现有轨迹异常检测方法只考虑轨迹的有限方面，在欧几里得空间中分析轨迹，忽略了底层移动网络（如道路或交通网络）的约束和连通性信息。

Conclusion: 将图结构和上下文语义整合到轨迹建模中，能够实现更精确和上下文感知的异常检测。

Abstract: Trajectory anomaly detection is essential for identifying unusual and
unexpected movement patterns in applications ranging from intelligent
transportation systems to urban safety and fraud prevention.
  Existing methods only consider limited aspects of the trajectory nature and
its movement space by treating trajectories as sequences of sampled locations,
with sampling determined by positioning technology, e.g., GPS, or by high-level
abstractions such as staypoints. Trajectories are analyzed in Euclidean space,
neglecting the constraints and connectivity information of the underlying
movement network, e.g., road or transit networks.
  The proposed Graph Enhanced Trajectory Anomaly Detection (GETAD) framework
tightly integrates road network topology, segment semantics, and historical
travel patterns to model trajectory data. GETAD uses a Graph Attention Network
to learn road-aware embeddings that capture both physical attributes and
transition behavior, and augments these with graph-based positional encodings
that reflect the spatial layout of the road network.
  A Transformer-based decoder models sequential movement, while a
multiobjective loss function combining autoregressive prediction and supervised
link prediction ensures realistic and structurally coherent representations.
  To improve the robustness of anomaly detection, we introduce Confidence
Weighted Negative Log Likelihood (CW NLL), an anomaly scoring function that
emphasizes high-confidence deviations.
  Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GETAD
achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, particularly in
detecting subtle anomalies in road-constrained environments. These results
highlight the benefits of incorporating graph structure and contextual
semantics into trajectory modeling, enabling more precise and context-aware
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by
updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task.
Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of
new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on
some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making
parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional
input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new
task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context
increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically
called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network
enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the
pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this
paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network
parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL
are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for
this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a
Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers
of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.

Abstract: We present a novel information-preserving Chaos Game Representation (CGR)
method, also called Reverse-CGR (R-CGR), for biological sequence analysis that
addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional CGR approaches - the loss
of sequence information during geometric mapping. Our method introduces
complete sequence recovery through explicit path encoding combined with
rational arithmetic precision control, enabling perfect sequence reconstruction
from stored geometric traces. Unlike purely geometric approaches, our
reversibility is achieved through comprehensive path storage that maintains
both positional and character information at each step. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of R-CGR on biological sequence classification tasks, achieving
competitive performance compared to traditional sequence-based methods while
providing interpretable geometric visualizations. The approach generates
feature-rich images suitable for deep learning while maintaining complete
sequence information through explicit encoding, opening new avenues for
interpretable bioinformatics analysis where both accuracy and sequence recovery
are essential.

Abstract: Utilizing offline reinforcement learning (RL) with real-world clinical data
is getting increasing attention in AI for healthcare. However, implementation
poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse
RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in
complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned
policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address
challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older
adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we
introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function
approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by
learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults
(experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework
provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline
RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm
clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study,
emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to
promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore
KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare
applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion
intervention strategies in healthcare.

Abstract: The simulation of complex physical systems using a discretized mesh is a
cornerstone of applied mechanics, but traditional numerical solvers are often
computationally prohibitive for many-query tasks. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogate models for mesh-based data, their
standard autoregressive application for long-term prediction is often plagued
by error accumulation and instability. To address this, we introduce
MeshODENet, a general framework that synergizes the spatial reasoning of GNNs
with the continuous-time modeling of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and versatility on a series of
challenging structural mechanics problems, including one- and two-dimensional
elastic bodies undergoing large, non-linear deformations. The results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in
long-term predictive accuracy and stability, while achieving substantial
computational speed-ups over traditional solvers. This work presents a powerful
and generalizable approach for developing data-driven surrogates to accelerate
the analysis and modeling of complex structural systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个AI驱动的框架，用于为给定的线性系统推荐MCMC参数，以加速Krylov子空间求解器的收敛。该框架通过图神经网络预测预处理速度，并使用贝叶斯采集函数选择最优参数集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对于病态矩阵，Krylov子空间求解器的收敛速度较慢，通常需要预处理器。基于MCMC的矩阵求逆可以生成这样的预处理器，但其效果取决于参数，而最优参数随矩阵变化，手动或网格搜索成本高昂。

Method: 使用图神经网络代理模型从矩阵A和MCMC参数预测预处理速度，然后通过贝叶斯采集函数选择最有可能最小化迭代次数的参数集。

Result: 在先前未见过的病态系统上，该框架仅使用传统方法50%的搜索预算就实现了更好的预处理效果，收敛迭代次数减少了约10%。

Conclusion: 这些结果为将基于MCMC的预处理器集成到大规模系统中提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering,
and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet
convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments
usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix
inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations,
but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices;
manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending
MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts
preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition
function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On
a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better
preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods,
yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results
suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale
systems.

Motivation: 解决血糖预测中多源信号采样率不一致、长期时间依赖性建模以及持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 设计并行工作的交叉注意力和多尺度注意力机制，交叉注意力整合血糖数据与其他生理行为信号，多尺度注意力捕捉长期时间依赖；引入知识保留模块防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GluMind框架通过创新的注意力机制和知识保留技术，在持续血糖预测任务中取得了显著性能提升，展示了在多模态时序数据建模方面的有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework
designed for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises
two attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention,
which operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance.
Cross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other
physiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate,
addressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse
impacts on robust prediction. Moreover, the multi-scale attention mechanism
captures long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting,
GluMind incorporates a knowledge retention technique into the transformer-based
forecasting model. The knowledge retention module not only enhances the model's
ability to retain prior knowledge but also boosts its overall forecasting
performance. We evaluate GluMind on the recently released AIREADI dataset,
which contains behavioral and physiological data collected from healthy people,
individuals with prediabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes. We examine the
performance stability and adaptability of GluMind in learning continuously as
new patient cohorts are introduced. Experimental results show that GluMind
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models, achieving
approximately 15% and 9% improvements in root mean squared error (RMSE) and
mean absolute error (MAE), respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了概率几何主成分分析（PGPCA），这是一种新的降维算法，能够显式地结合非线性流形知识，将概率主成分分析（PPCA）推广到非线性流形几何中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多神经科学应用中，数据可能分布在非线性几何（即流形）周围，而不是位于欧几里得空间中。现有的PPCA及其扩展主要基于线性模型，只能描述欧几里得坐标系中的数据。

Method: 开发了PGPCA算法，能够显式地结合给定的非线性流形知识。推导了几何坐标系来捕捉数据与流形的偏差和噪声，并提出了数据驱动的EM算法来学习PGPCA模型参数。

Result: 在模拟和脑数据分析中，PGPCA能够有效建模各种给定流形周围的数据分布，并且在此类数据上优于PPCA。PGPCA还提供了测试几何坐标系是否比欧几里得坐标系更好地描述数据的能力。

Conclusion: PGPCA通过结合非线性流形几何，增强了高维数据分析中降维的有效性，特别是对于表现出噪声且分布在非线性流形周围的数据。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science
including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a
prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic
approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection
between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its
extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in
a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data
may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than
lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal
Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction
algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear
manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition
to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be
derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold
and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA
model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data
distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations
and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data
distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data.
Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric
coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally,
PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both
around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for
enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of
high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear
manifold.

Motivation: 传统的连续时间扩散模型存在训练与推理条件不匹配、推理效率低等问题。离散时间过程可以避免这些限制，提供更一致和高效的训练/推理方案。

Method: 探索了几种扩散式离散时间过程，包括加性高斯噪声、乘性高斯噪声、模糊噪声以及模糊与高斯噪声的混合。提出了新的变体方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，离散时间过程在主观和客观语音质量上与流行的连续时间模型相当，但具有更高效和一致的训练与推理模式。

Conclusion: 离散时间扩散过程为语音生成提供了一种有前景的替代方案，在保持质量的同时显著提高了效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. These
models view speech generation as a continuous-time process. For efficient
training, this process is typically restricted to additive Gaussian noising,
which is limiting. For inference, the time is typically discretized, leading to
the mismatch between continuous training and discrete sampling conditions.
Recently proposed discrete-time processes, on the other hand, usually do not
have these limitations, may require substantially fewer inference steps, and
are fully consistent between training/inference conditions. This paper explores
some diffusion-like discrete-time processes and proposes some new variants.
These include processes applying additive Gaussian noise, multiplicative
Gaussian noise, blurring noise and a mixture of blurring and Gaussian noises.
The experimental results suggest that discrete-time processes offer comparable
subjective and objective speech quality to their widely popular continuous
counterpart, with more efficient and consistent training and inference schemas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维嵌入向量的大尺寸给现代向量搜索技术带来了问题：从内存/存储中检索大向量成本高昂，且其存储占用也很昂贵。

Method: 使用新颖的简洁且计算高效的非线性方法构建非均匀向量量化器，这些量化器针对每个索引向量单独学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，NVQ在最小计算成本下相比现有技术表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: NVQ在高保真度机制下是一种计算和空间效率都很高的向量压缩技术。

Abstract: Embedding vectors are widely used for representing unstructured data and
searching through it for semantically similar items. However, the large size of
these vectors, due to their high-dimensionality, creates problems for modern
vector search techniques: retrieving large vectors from memory/storage is
expensive and their footprint is costly. In this work, we present NVQ
(non-uniform vector quantization), a new vector compression technique that is
computationally and spatially efficient in the high-fidelity regime. The core
in NVQ is to use novel parsimonious and computationally efficient
nonlinearities for building non-uniform vector quantizers. Critically, these
quantizers are \emph{individually} learned for each indexed vector. Our
experimental results show that NVQ exhibits improved accuracy compared to the
state of the art with a minimal computational cost.

Method: 使用标准Transformer块配合自适应层，通过生成式流匹配目标和结构项进行训练，模型规模达30亿参数，在900万蒸馏蛋白质结构和实验PDB数据上训练。

Result: 在标准折叠基准测试中，SimpleFold-3B达到与最先进基线相当的竞争性能，在集成预测方面表现优异，且在消费级硬件上部署和推理效率高。

Conclusion: SimpleFold证明了通用架构在蛋白质折叠任务中的有效性，为未来研究开辟了新的设计空间，挑战了对复杂领域特定架构的依赖。

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a
combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and
training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across
different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these
architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In
this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein
folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein
folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving
triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training
objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs
standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a
generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale
SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein
structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks,
SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble
prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic
reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold
shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware.
SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures
designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future
progress.

Motivation: 量子系统在高维希尔伯特空间中的演化使得传统数值方法计算成本高昂，现有神经网络架构需要大量训练数据且存在虚假振荡问题，影响物理可解释性。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov Arnold Networks（KANs）并结合物理信息损失函数来强制执行Ehrenfest定理，同时引入了Chain of KANs架构，将时间因果关系直接嵌入模型设计中。

Result: 该方法仅需200个样本（传统Temporal Convolution Networks需要3,700个），即5.4%的训练数据就能达到更优的准确度，显著降低了数据需求。

Conclusion: 物理信息KANs相比传统黑盒模型具有明显优势，在保持数学严谨性和物理一致性的同时大幅减少了数据需求，为量子动力学建模提供了有前景的新途径。

Abstract: The prediction of quantum dynamical responses lies at the heart of modern
physics. Yet, modeling these time-dependent behaviors remains a formidable
challenge because quantum systems evolve in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
often rendering traditional numerical methods computationally prohibitive.
While large language models have achieved remarkable success in sequential
prediction, quantum dynamics presents a fundamentally different challenge:
forecasting the entire temporal evolution of quantum systems rather than merely
the next element in a sequence. Existing neural architectures such as recurrent
and convolutional networks often require vast training datasets and suffer from
spurious oscillations that compromise physical interpretability. In this work,
we introduce a fundamentally new approach: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs)
augmented with physics-informed loss functions that enforce the Ehrenfest
theorems. Our method achieves superior accuracy with significantly less
training data: it requires only 5.4 percent of the samples (200) compared to
Temporal Convolution Networks (3,700). We further introduce the Chain of KANs,
a novel architecture that embeds temporal causality directly into the model
design, making it particularly well-suited for time series modeling. Our
results demonstrate that physics-informed KANs offer a compelling advantage
over conventional black-box models, maintaining both mathematical rigor and
physical consistency while dramatically reducing data requirements.

Conclusion: 混合数据集为金融机构提供了一条实用的途径来增强反洗钱系统，解决了数据隐私和模型性能之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Money laundering is a critical global issue for financial institutions.
Automated Anti-money laundering (AML) models, like Graph Neural Networks (GNN),
can be trained to identify illicit transactions in real time. A major issue for
developing such models is the lack of access to training data due to privacy
and confidentiality concerns. Synthetically generated data that mimics the
statistical properties of real data but preserves privacy and confidentiality
has been proposed as a solution. However, training AML models on purely
synthetic datasets presents its own set of challenges. This article proposes
the use of hybrid datasets to augment the utility of synthetic datasets by
incorporating publicly available, easily accessible, and real-world features.
These additions demonstrate that hybrid datasets not only preserve privacy but
also improve model utility, offering a practical pathway for financial
institutions to enhance AML systems.

TL;DR: APRIL是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过主动部分rollout策略解决长尾响应分布导致的GPU空闲问题，提高训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL训练中，rollout生成占90%以上运行时间，且长尾响应分布导致GPU空闲和利用率低下，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: APRIL在rollout阶段过度配置请求，一旦达到目标响应数量就终止，并将未完成的响应回收用于后续步骤继续处理。

Result: 实验显示APRIL将rollout吞吐量最多提高44%，加速收敛，并在各种任务上实现最多8%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: APRIL统一了系统级和算法级考虑，提高了RL训练效率，且与框架和硬件无关，已在slime RL框架中集成。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale
pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o
series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale
RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the
community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. Most
of these frameworks primarily rely on inference engines for rollout generation
and training engines for policy updates. However, RL training remains
computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90%
of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the
long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy
responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model
and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits
scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in
Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the
rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the
target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for
continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are
discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that
APRIL improves rollout throughput by at most 44% across commonly used RL
algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves at most 8%
higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and
hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and
deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies
system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of
advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL
systems.

### [302] [Reverse-Complement Consistency for DNA Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18529)
*Mingqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反向互补一致性正则化（RCCR）的简单且模型无关的微调方法，旨在解决DNA语言模型无法捕捉DNA序列反向互补对称性的问题，从而提高模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA序列的反向互补（RC）通常具有相同的生物学意义，但现有的DNA语言模型往往无法捕捉这种对称性，导致对序列及其RC对应物的预测不一致，降低了模型的可靠性。

Method: RCCR是一种直接惩罚模型在序列上预测与其反向补体对齐预测之间差异的微调目标。该方法在三个不同的骨干网络（Nucleotide Transformer、HyenaDNA、DNABERT-2）上进行了评估，涵盖了序列分类、标量回归和轮廓预测等多种基因组任务。

Result: 实验表明，RCCR显著提高了RC鲁棒性，大幅减少了预测翻转和错误，同时在任务准确性上保持或优于基线方法（如RC数据增强和测试时平均）。

Conclusion: 通过将关键的生物学先验直接整合到学习过程中，RCCR为不同的生物学任务提供了一种单一、内在鲁棒且计算高效的模型微调方案。

Abstract: A fundamental property of DNA is that the reverse complement (RC) of a
sequence often carries identical biological meaning. However, state-of-the-art
DNA language models frequently fail to capture this symmetry, producing
inconsistent predictions for a sequence and its RC counterpart, which
undermines their reliability. In this work, we introduce Reverse-Complement
Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a simple and model-agnostic fine-tuning
objective that directly penalizes the divergence between a model's prediction
on a sequence and the aligned prediction on its reverse complement. We evaluate
RCCR across three diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA,
DNABERT-2) on a wide range of genomic tasks, including sequence classification,
scalar regression, and profile prediction. Our experiments show that RCCR
substantially improves RC robustness by dramatically reducing prediction flips
and errors, all while maintaining or improving task accuracy compared to
baselines such as RC data augmentation and test-time averaging. By integrating
a key biological prior directly into the learning process, RCCR produces a
single, intrinsically robust, and computationally efficient model fine-tuning
recipe for diverse biology tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型上循环方法通常重用单个预训练密集模型的FFN层作为专家，这限制了专家的多样性。本文旨在利用多个架构相同但来源不同的预训练模型来构建更强大的MoE模型。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）训练自由阶段：通过层感知融合策略构建共享骨干，并使用基于激活的功能对齐缓解参数错位；2）轻量级路由器训练阶段协调整个架构。

Result: 实验表明该方法成功整合了异构来源的专家，构建的MoE模型在多领域任务和分布外泛化方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Symphony-MoE框架有效解决了多源预训练模型整合的挑战，为构建更强大的MoE模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enable scalable performance by activating
large parameter sets sparsely, minimizing computational overhead. To circumvent
the prohibitive cost of training MoEs from scratch, recent work employs
upcycling, reusing a single pre-trained dense model by replicating its
feed-forward network (FFN) layers into experts. However, this limits expert
diversity, as all experts originate from a single pre-trained dense model. This
paper addresses this limitation by constructing powerful MoE models using
experts sourced from multiple identically-architected but disparate pre-trained
models (e.g., Llama2-Chat and Code Llama). A key challenge lies in the fact
that these source models occupy disparate, dissonant regions of the parameter
space, making direct upcycling prone to severe performance degradation. To
overcome this, we propose Symphony-MoE, a novel two-stage framework designed to
harmonize these models into a single, coherent expert mixture. First, we
establish this harmony in a training-free manner: we construct a shared
backbone via a layer-aware fusion strategy and, crucially, alleviate parameter
misalignment among experts using activation-based functional alignment.
Subsequently, a single lightweight stage of router training coordinates the
entire architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully
integrates experts from heterogeneous sources, achieving an MoE model that
significantly surpasses baselines in multi-domain tasks and out-of-distribution
generalization.

Conclusion: 提出了具有显式相对偏置的sigmoid损失重参数化方法，在合成数据实验中改善了训练动态。

Abstract: The meta-task of obtaining and aligning representations through contrastive
pretraining is steadily gaining importance since its introduction in CLIP and
ALIGN. In this paper we theoretically explain the advantages of synchronizing
with trainable inverse temperature and bias under the sigmoid loss, as
implemented in the recent SigLIP and SigLIP2 models of Google DeepMind.
Temperature and bias can drive the loss function to zero for a rich class of
configurations that we call $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations. $(\mathsf{m},
\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}})$-Constellations are a novel combinatorial object
related to spherical codes and are parametrized by a margin $\mathsf{m}$ and
relative bias $\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{rel}}$. We use our characterization of
constellations to theoretically justify the success of SigLIP on retrieval, to
explain the modality gap present in SigLIP, and to identify the necessary
dimension for producing high-quality representations. Finally, we propose a
reparameterization of the sigmoid loss with explicit relative bias, which
improves training dynamics in experiments with synthetic data.

Abstract: Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with multiple
etiologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal
dementia, and vascular dementia. Its clinical and biological heterogeneity
makes diagnosis and subtype differentiation highly challenging. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have recently shown strong potential in modeling brain
connectivity, but their limited robustness, data scarcity, and lack of
interpretability constrain clinical adoption. Explainable Graph Neural Networks
(XGNNs) have emerged to address these barriers by combining graph-based
learning with interpretability, enabling the identification of disease-relevant
biomarkers, analysis of brain network disruptions, and provision of transparent
insights for clinicians. This paper presents the first comprehensive review
dedicated to XGNNs in dementia research. We examine their applications across
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and
multi-disease diagnosis. A taxonomy of explainability methods tailored for
dementia-related tasks is introduced, alongside comparisons of existing models
in clinical scenarios. We also highlight challenges such as limited
generalizability, underexplored domains, and the integration of Large Language

problems, this review aims to guide future work toward trustworthy, clinically
meaningful, and scalable use of XGNNs in dementia research.

### [306] [Interaction Topological Transformer for Multiscale Learning in Porous Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18573)
*Dong Chen,Jian Liu,Chun-Long Chen,Guo-Wei Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT)框架，通过多尺度交互拓扑结构来预测多孔材料的吸附、传输和稳定性性能，实现了最先进的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多孔材料具有复杂的多尺度结构-性能关系，现有建模方法难以处理局部化学环境和全局孔隙网络拓扑的复杂性，且标记数据稀疏分布不均，限制了跨材料家族的泛化能力。

Method: 开发了ITT框架，利用新颖的交互拓扑在多尺度多层次捕获材料信息，包括结构、元素、原子和成对元素组织。采用两阶段训练策略：在60万未标记结构上进行自监督预训练，然后进行监督微调。

Result: ITT在吸附、传输和稳定性性能预测方面达到了最先进的准确性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构多样性和化学多样性的多孔材料提供了原则性和可扩展的学习引导发现路径。

Abstract: Porous materials exhibit vast structural diversity and support critical
applications in gas storage, separations, and catalysis. However, predictive
modeling remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of structure-property
relationships, where performance is governed by both local chemical
environments and global pore-network topology. These complexities, combined
with sparse and unevenly distributed labeled data, hinder generalization across
material families. We propose the Interaction Topological Transformer (ITT), a
unified data-efficient framework that leverages novel interaction topology to
capture materials information across multiple scales and multiple levels,
including structural, elemental, atomic, and pairwise-elemental organization.
ITT extracts scale-aware features that reflect both compositional and
relational structure within complex porous frameworks, and integrates them
through a built-in Transformer architecture that supports joint reasoning
across scales. Trained using a two-stage strategy, i.e., self-supervised
pretraining on 0.6 million unlabeled structures followed by supervised
fine-tuning, ITT achieves state-of-the-art, accurate, and transferable
predictions for adsorption, transport, and stability properties. This framework
provides a principled and scalable path for learning-guided discovery in
structurally and chemically diverse porous materials.

*Mingchun Sun,Rongqiang Zhao,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DS-Diffusion模型，解决现有时间序列生成扩散模型需要重新训练引入条件指导、生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差、推理过程不可解释等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在时间序列生成中存在三个主要问题：1）需要重新训练整个框架来引入特定条件指导；2）生成数据与真实数据存在分布偏差，导致下游任务模型偏差；3）扩散模型和潜在空间的复杂性导致推理过程不可解释。

Method: 提出数据风格引导扩散模型（DS-Diffusion），包括：1）基于风格引导核的扩散框架，避免特定条件的重新训练；2）基于时间信息的分层去噪机制（THD），减少生成数据与真实数据的分布偏差；3）生成样本能清晰指示其来源的数据风格。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，与最先进的ImagenTime模型相比，预测分数和判别分数分别降低了5.56%和61.55%。生成数据与真实数据的分布偏差进一步减小，推理过程更加可解释。

Conclusion: DS-Diffusion模型通过避免重新训练扩散模型，增强了模型对特定条件的灵活性和适应性，同时提高了生成质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation
tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require
retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.
There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated
data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream
tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces
leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we
propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the
DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed
to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based
hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,
the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they
originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets
to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the
discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further
reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by
eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and
adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.

TL;DR: REBACT方法通过在行动前增加反思步骤，显著提升LLM在交互决策任务中的表现，减少错误累积并增强自我纠正能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM交互决策方法存在错误累积问题且缺乏有效的自我纠正机制，需要一种能够即时纠正错误、适应环境反馈的方法

Method: 提出"Reflect before Act"(REBACT)方法，在采取下一个行动前引入关键的反思步骤，实现即时错误纠正和行动路径优化

Result: 在ALFWorld、WebShop和TextCraft三个交互环境中，REBACT显著优于基线方法，成功率分别提升6.72%(达到98.51%)、24%(达到61%)和0.5%(达到99.5%)

Conclusion: REBACT通过少量修改步骤即可实现性能提升，证明了其计算效率，为LLM交互决策提供了有效的自我纠正机制

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interactive decision-making tasks, but existing methods often struggle with
error accumulation and lack robust self-correction mechanisms. We introduce
"Reflect before Act" (REBACT), a novel approach that enhances LLM-based
decision-making by introducing a critical reflect step prior to taking the next
action. This approach allows for immediate error correction, ensuring smooth
action path and adaptibity to environment feedback. We evaluate REBACT on three
diverse interactive environments: ALFWorld, WebShop, and TextCraft. Our results
demonstrate that REBACT significantly outperforms strong baselines, improving
success rates by up to 24% on WebShop (achieving 61%), 6.72% on ALFWorld
(achieving 98.51%), and 0.5% on TextCraft (achieving 99.5%) using
Claude3.5-sonnet as the underlying LLM. Further analysis reveals that REBACT's
performance improvements are achieved with only a few modification steps,
demonstrating its computational efficiency.

### [309] [Flow marching for a generative PDE foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18611)
*Zituo Chen,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Flow Marching算法，将神经算子学习与流匹配相结合，构建生成式PDE基础模型，通过联合采样噪声水平和物理时间步长，学习统一速度场以减少长期滚动漂移并实现不确定性感知的集合生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要依赖确定性Transformer架构，缺乏生成灵活性，难以满足科学和工程应用中对不确定性建模的需求。

Method: 1. Flow Marching算法：分析物理动力系统中的误差积累，将神经算子学习与流匹配结合；2. P2VAE：将物理状态嵌入紧凑潜在空间；3. FMT：结合扩散强迫方案和潜在时间金字塔，计算效率比全长度视频扩散模型高15倍。

Result: 在12个不同PDE家族的约250万条轨迹上训练多尺度模型，在未见过的Kolmogorov湍流上通过少样本适应进行基准测试，展示长期滚动稳定性优于确定性模型，并提供不确定性分层的集合结果。

Conclusion: 生成式PDE基础模型对于现实世界应用具有重要意义，Flow Marching方法在减少计算成本的同时提高了模型的生成能力和不确定性建模能力。

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale collections of PDE-governed spatiotemporal
trajectories has recently shown promise for building generalizable models of
dynamical systems. Yet most existing PDE foundation models rely on
deterministic Transformer architectures, which lack generative flexibility for
many science and engineering applications. We propose Flow Marching, an
algorithm that bridges neural operator learning with flow matching motivated by
an analysis of error accumulation in physical dynamical systems, and we build a
generative PDE foundation model on top of it. By jointly sampling the noise
level and the physical time step between adjacent states, the model learns a
unified velocity field that transports a noisy current state toward its clean
successor, reducing long-term rollout drift while enabling uncertainty-aware
ensemble generations. Alongside this core algorithm, we introduce a
Physics-Pretrained Variational Autoencoder (P2VAE) to embed physical states
into a compact latent space, and an efficient Flow Marching Transformer (FMT)
that combines a diffusion-forcing scheme with latent temporal pyramids,
achieving up to 15x greater computational efficiency than full-length video
diffusion models and thereby enabling large-scale pretraining at substantially
reduced cost. We curate a corpus of ~2.5M trajectories across 12 distinct PDE
families and train suites of P2VAEs and FMTs at multiple scales. On downstream
evaluation, we benchmark on unseen Kolmogorov turbulence with few-shot
adaptation, demonstrate long-term rollout stability over deterministic
counterparts, and present uncertainty-stratified ensemble results, highlighting
the importance of generative PDE foundation models for real-world applications.

### [310] [HyperAdapt: Simple High-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18629)
*Abel Gurung,Joseph Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperAdapt是一种参数高效微调方法，通过行列缩放对角矩阵实现高秩更新，仅需n+m个可训练参数即可适配n×m矩阵，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多样化任务中表现出色，但适应专业应用通常需要微调，这种方法内存和计算成本高。参数高效微调方法通过仅更新少量权重来缓解这一问题。

Method: HyperAdapt通过应用行列缩放对角矩阵来适配预训练权重矩阵，实现高秩更新。理论分析建立了更新秩的上界，实验验证了其在各模型层中持续诱导高秩变换。

Result: 在GLUE、算术推理和常识推理基准测试中，使用高达140亿参数的模型进行实验，HyperAdapt在性能上匹配或接近全微调和最先进PEFT方法，同时使用数量级更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: HyperAdapt是一种高效的参数微调方法，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著减少训练参数，为大规模模型的高效适配提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundation models excel across diverse tasks, but adapting them to
specialized applications often requires fine-tuning, an approach that is memory
and compute-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate
this by updating only a small subset of weights. In this paper, we introduce
HyperAdapt, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that significantly reduces
the number of trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods like
LoRA. Specifically, HyperAdapt adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by applying
row- and column-wise scaling through diagonal matrices, thereby inducing a
high-rank update while requiring only $n+m$ trainable parameters for an $n
\times m$ matrix. Theoretically, we establish an upper bound on the rank of
HyperAdapt's updates, and empirically, we confirm that it consistently induces
high-rank transformations across model layers. Experiments on GLUE, arithmetic
reasoning, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks with models up to 14B
parameters demonstrate that HyperAdapt matches or nearly matches the
performance of full fine-tuning and state-of-the-art PEFT methods while using
orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的子空间聚类框架SCoS，直接对矩阵数据进行聚类，基于列空间而非向量化数据，通过三阶张量的块项分解实现聚类成员和部分共享子空间的联合估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子空间聚类方法假设向量化数据，但现实应用中数据样本本身可能是矩阵形式，需要直接对矩阵的列空间进行聚类分析。

Method: 基于块项分解(BTD)的三阶张量分解方法，构建输入矩阵的三阶张量，实现聚类成员和部分共享子空间的联合估计。

Result: 在真实高光谱成像数据集上的实验表明，该方法在高噪声和干扰下具有优越的聚类准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架在处理具有超越单个数据向量结构的高维应用方面具有重要潜力，特别是在噪声和干扰较大的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices
based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of
Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume
vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix
and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish
conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation
Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general
setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a
third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint
estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide
the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable
optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world
hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior
clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and
interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These
results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging
high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data
vectors.

Abstract: This research focuses on rational pesticide design, using graph machine
learning to accelerate the development of safer, eco-friendly agrochemicals,
inspired by in silico methods in drug discovery. With an emphasis on
ecotoxicology, the initial contributions include the creation of ApisTox, the
largest curated dataset on pesticide toxicity to honey bees. We conducted a
broad evaluation of machine learning (ML) models for molecular graph
classification, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, GNNs, and
pretrained transformers. The results show that methods successful in medicinal
chemistry often fail to generalize to agrochemicals, underscoring the need for
domain-specific models and benchmarks. Future work will focus on developing a
comprehensive benchmarking suite and designing ML models tailored to the unique
challenges of pesticide discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了广义双模拟度量(GBSM)，用于计算两个马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)之间的状态相似性，解决了传统双模拟度量在多MDP场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双模拟度量(BSM)在单个MDP中有效，但在多MDP场景（如策略迁移）中应用受限。现有方法缺乏对数学性质的严格分析，限制了理论进展。

Method: 形式化建立了MDP对之间的广义双模拟度量，严格证明了三个基本性质：对称性、跨MDP三角不等式和相同状态空间上的距离界。

Result: GBSM在策略迁移、状态聚合和基于采样的估计中获得了比标准BSM更严格的理论界限，并提供了闭式样本复杂度估计。数值结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: GBSM为多MDP场景提供了理论基础，在理论和实践上都优于传统BSM方法。

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state
similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states
closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been
successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state
representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP
scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has
attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis
of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In
this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM)
between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental
properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance
bound on identical state spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically
analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in
MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived
from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample
complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on
BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM在推进工业级强化学习应用方面的潜力，特别是在复杂风险检测场景中。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to e-commerce payment fraud detection by
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). By
framing transaction risk as a multi-step Markov Decision Process (MDP), RL
optimizes risk detection across multiple payment stages. Crafting effective
reward functions, essential for RL model success, typically requires
significant human expertise due to the complexity and variability in design.
LLMs, with their advanced reasoning and coding capabilities, are well-suited to
refine these functions, offering improvements over traditional methods. Our
approach leverages LLMs to iteratively enhance reward functions, achieving
better fraud detection accuracy and demonstrating zero-shot capability.
Experiments with real-world data confirm the effectiveness, robustness, and
resilience of our LLM-enhanced RL framework through long-term evaluations,
underscoring the potential of LLMs in advancing industrial RL applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的周期性CNN架构，通过引入周期性边界条件，证明了其在d维输入空间中能够逼近依赖于d-1个线性变量的脊函数，而较低维度的脊函数逼近是不可能的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在处理具有周期性结构的数据时存在局限性，特别是在图像分析、物理信息学习和材料科学等领域，数据往往具有高内在维度的脊状结构。

Method: 设计了一种周期性CNN架构，在卷积层中引入周期性边界条件，并通过严格的数学定理证明了其表达能力。

Result: 理论证明了周期性CNN能够精确逼近高维脊函数，而传统方法无法实现这种逼近，为CNN近似理论提供了新的数学基础。

Conclusion: 周期性CNN不仅扩展了CNN近似理论的数学基础，还展示了一类具有实用价值的架构，特别适用于具有周期性结构的高维数据问题。

Abstract: We introduce a novel convolutional neural network architecture, termed the
\emph{periodic CNN}, which incorporates periodic boundary conditions into the
convolutional layers. Our main theoretical contribution is a rigorous
approximation theorem: periodic CNNs can approximate ridge functions depending
on $d-1$ linear variables in a $d$-dimensional input space, while such
approximation is impossible in lower-dimensional ridge settings ($d-2$ or fewer
variables). This result establishes a sharp characterization of the expressive
power of periodic CNNs. Beyond the theory, our findings suggest that periodic
CNNs are particularly well-suited for problems where data naturally admits a
ridge-like structure of high intrinsic dimension, such as image analysis on
wrapped domains, physics-informed learning, and materials science. The work
thus both expands the mathematical foundation of CNN approximation theory and
highlights a class of architectures with surprising and practically relevant
approximation capabilities.

TL;DR: MOMEMTO是一个基于时间序列基础模型的时间序列异常检测方法，通过引入基于patch的内存模块来缓解模型过度泛化问题，能够在多个数据集上联合微调并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于重构的深度模型在时间序列异常检测中容易过度泛化，准确重构未见过的异常；而现有的内存架构方法训练成本高且难以有效整合时间序列基础模型。

Method: 提出MOMEMTO方法，包含基于patch的内存模块，从多个领域捕获代表性正常模式，通过多领域训练策略实现单一模型在多个数据集上的联合微调。内存项使用预训练编码器的潜在表示初始化，组织为patch级单元，并通过注意力机制更新。

Result: 在23个单变量基准数据集上的实验结果表明，MOMEMTO在AUC和VUS指标上优于基线方法，并显著提升了其骨干时间序列基础模型的性能，特别是在少样本学习场景中。

Conclusion: MOMEMTO通过内存模块有效缓解了时间序列异常检测中的过度泛化问题，实现了多数据集联合训练的高效异常检测。

Abstract: Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time
series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability
increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen
anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by
incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to
be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection,
enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The
memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from
multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across
multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes
memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes
them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We
evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on
AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the
performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.

Motivation: 对角线性网络因其隐含正则化可被严格分析而具有理论价值，本文旨在深化对其训练轨迹的理解，揭示其与LASSO正则化路径的关系。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值模拟，研究对角线性网络从小初始化开始的训练过程，并与LASSO正则化路径进行对比。

Result: 在LASSO路径单调性假设下，两者联系精确；一般情况下，两者存在近似联系。训练时间可视为逆正则化参数。

Conclusion: 对角线性网络的训练轨迹与LASSO正则化路径密切相关，这一发现为理解神经网络训练的动态特性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and
diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit
regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the
training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with
minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen
this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear
networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this
connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization
parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate
this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization
path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate
connection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks has been increasingly applied in fault diagnostics,
where it uses historical data

symmetric non-negative matrix factorization, and doubly stochastic
normalization, can be viewed as relaxations of the kernel $k$-means approach.
However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank,
nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical
feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper,
guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank
\textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only
relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering
results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between
orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By
integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the
maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further
enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we
transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex
constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We
further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD
and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient
descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出Shared-Weights Extender（SWE）和Steepest Voting Distributor（SVoD）两种方法，用于在训练过程中扩展神经网络，防止新增神经元失效，提升网络容量和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在训练过程中扩展神经网络可以增加容量而无需从头训练更大模型，但新增神经元往往无法适应已训练网络而变得无效，无法贡献容量增长。

Method: SWE方法通过将新增神经元与现有神经元耦合实现平滑集成，防止神经元失效；SVoD是基于梯度的神经元分配方法，用于在深度网络扩展时跨层分配神经元。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，该方法能有效抑制神经元失效，相比其他扩展方法和基线获得更好性能。

Conclusion: 提出的SWE和SVoD方法能够有效解决神经网络扩展时的新增神经元失效问题，实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Expanding neural networks during training is a promising way to augment
capacity without retraining larger models from scratch. However, newly added
neurons often fail to adjust to a trained network and become inactive,
providing no contribution to capacity growth. We propose the Shared-Weights
Extender (SWE), a novel method explicitly designed to prevent inactivity of new
neurons by coupling them with existing ones for smooth integration. In
parallel, we introduce the Steepest Voting Distributor (SVoD), a gradient-based
method for allocating neurons across layers during deep network expansion. Our
extensive benchmarking on four datasets shows that our method can effectively
suppress neuron inactivity and achieve better performance compared to other
expanding methods and baselines.

TL;DR: NGRPO是一种改进的RLVR算法，通过优势校准和非对称剪裁解决GRPO在响应组完全正确或完全错误时无法学习的问题，显著提升了数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在响应组完全正确或完全错误时无法学习，特别是在完全错误的响应组中优势函数为零，导致梯度消失和学习信号丢失。

Method: 1. 优势校准：在优势计算中假设存在虚拟最大奖励样本，改变组内奖励的均值和方差，确保完全错误样本的优势不再为零；2. 非对称剪裁：放松正样本的更新幅度，同时对负样本施加更严格的约束，稳定探索压力。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型上的实验表明，NGRPO在MATH500、AMC23和AIME2025等数学基准上显著优于PPO、GRPO、DAPO和PSR-NSR等基线方法。

Conclusion: NGRPO能够从完全错误中学习，实现稳定且显著的数学推理改进，验证了其处理同质错误的有效性。

Abstract: RLVR has enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
across various tasks. However, GRPO, a representative RLVR algorithm, suffers
from a critical limitation: when all responses within a group are either
entirely correct or entirely incorrect, the model fails to learn from these
homogeneous responses. This is particularly problematic for homogeneously
incorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,
leading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To
overcome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust
learning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism
hypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage
calculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group
and ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no
longer zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the
update magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on
that of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure
introduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B
demonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,
DAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and
AIME2025. These results validate NGRPO's ability to learn from homogeneous
errors, leading to stable and substantial improvements in mathematical
reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/nangongrui-ngr/NGRPO.

Abstract: While heterophily has been widely studied in node-level tasks, its impact on
graph-level tasks remains unclear. We present the first analysis of heterophily
in graph-level learning, combining theoretical insights with empirical
validation. We first introduce a taxonomy of graph-level labeling schemes, and
focus on motif-based tasks within local structure labeling, which is a popular
labeling scheme. Using energy-based gradient flow analysis, we reveal a key
insight: unlike frequency-dominated regimes in node-level tasks, motif
detection requires mixed-frequency dynamics to remain flexible across multiple
spectral components. Our theory shows that motif objectives are inherently
misaligned with global frequency dominance, demanding distinct architectural
considerations. Experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled heterophily
and real-world molecular property prediction support our findings, showing that
frequency-adaptive model outperform frequency-dominated models. This work
establishes a new theoretical understanding of heterophily in graph-level
learning and offers guidance for designing effective GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习后门攻击方法，通过动态优化后门触发器来解耦主任务和后门任务，提高攻击的持久性和隐蔽性。


<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习的分布式特性暴露了新的攻击面，现有后门攻击依赖固定模式或对抗性扰动作为触发器，导致主任务和后门任务紧密耦合，容易被诚实更新稀释并在联邦防御下持久性有限。

Method: 采用min-max框架动态优化后门触发器：内层最大化中毒样本与良性样本的性能差距，确保良性用户更新对后门影响最小；外层将自适应触发器注入本地模型。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言任务上评估，与6种后门攻击方法和6种防御算法比较，实验结果表明该方法攻击性能良好，且易于集成到现有后门攻击技术中。

Conclusion: 提出的动态触发器优化方法有效解耦了主任务和后门任务，显著提高了联邦学习环境下后门攻击的持久性和防御规避能力。

Abstract: Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a
central model without sharing their private data. However, this distributed
nature also exposes new attack surfaces. In particular, backdoor attacks allow
attackers to implant malicious behaviors into the global model while
maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs. Existing attacks usually rely on
fixed patterns or adversarial perturbations as triggers, which tightly couple
the main and backdoor tasks. This coupling makes them vulnerable to dilution by
honest updates and limits their persistence under federated defenses. In this
work, we propose an approach to decouple the backdoor task from the main task
by dynamically optimizing the backdoor trigger within a min-max framework. The
inner layer maximizes the performance gap between poisoned and benign samples,
ensuring that the contributions of benign users have minimal impact on the
backdoor. The outer process injects the adaptive triggers into the local model.
We evaluate our method on both computer vision and natural language tasks, and
compare it with six backdoor attack methods under six defense algorithms.
Experimental results show that our method achieves good attack performance and
can be easily integrated into existing backdoor attack techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算法推理存在无法构造有效解、无法处理多个正确解、在NP难问题上表现差、以及缺乏专家算法时无法应用等局限性。

Method: 将算法轨迹学习问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出GNARL框架，包含从NAR到RL的问题转换方法和适用于图基问题的学习架构。

Result: 在多个CLRS-30问题上获得很高的图精度，在NP难问题上表现匹配或超过更窄的NAR方法，甚至在缺乏专家算法时也能应用。

Conclusion: GNARL框架成功解决了NAR的关键局限性，为算法学习提供了更通用和强大的方法。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks
to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes,
important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without
post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on
combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which
strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe
the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process,
which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the
powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the
GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations
from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of
graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several
CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR
approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when
lacking an expert algorithm.

Motivation: 随着隐私问题日益严重，公开发布的贝叶斯网络模型需要保护训练数据中的敏感信息。现有的噪声添加方法虽然提供强大的隐私保护，但会显著影响模型的实用性。

Method: 将贝叶斯网络转换为置信网络，通过模糊化原始模型来减少追踪攻击的成功概率，同时识别需要隐藏的关键学习信息以防止攻击者恢复原始BN。

Result: 数值实验表明，通过调整CN超参数可以调节隐私增益，CN能够在保护隐私的同时实现有意义的推理。

Conclusion: 置信网络为开发隐私感知的概率图模型提供了一种原则性、实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable
efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective
across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The
structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly
learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes
increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive
information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize
privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine
the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals
belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection
tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this
offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the
model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the
resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of
releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks
(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After
adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the
masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful
attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve
meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key
learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from
recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical
experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN
hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,
and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic
graphical models.

Result: 在11个基准数据集上实验表明，ζ策略在保持高精度的同时显著减少资源消耗，部分情况下甚至优于竞争对手

Conclusion: HEROS框架和ζ策略为绿色在线学习提供了有效解决方案，在保证性能的同时大幅提升资源效率

Abstract: Ensemble methods for stream mining necessitate managing multiple models and
updating them as data distributions evolve. Considering the calls for more
sustainability, established methods are however not sufficiently considerate of
ensemble members' computational expenses and instead overly focus on predictive
capabilities. To address these challenges and enable green online learning, we
propose heterogeneous online ensembles (HEROS). For every training step, HEROS
chooses a subset of models from a pool of models initialized with diverse
hyperparameter choices under resource constraints to train. We introduce a
Markov decision process to theoretically capture the trade-offs between
predictive performance and sustainability constraints. Based on this framework,
we present different policies for choosing which models to train on incoming
data. Most notably, we propose the novel $\zeta$-policy, which focuses on
training near-optimal models at reduced costs. Using a stochastic model, we
theoretically prove that our $\zeta$-policy achieves near optimal performance
while using fewer resources compared to the best performing policy. In our
experiments across 11 benchmark datasets, we find empiric evidence that our
$\zeta$-policy is a strong contribution to the state-of-the-art, demonstrating
highly accurate performance, in some cases even outperforming competitors, and
simultaneously being much more resource-friendly.

Motivation: 传统SNN虽然理论上具有高能效，但实际推理过程中需要计算时间衰减函数和突触权重乘法，这些数字操作消耗大量能量，未能充分发挥SNN的能效优势。

Method: 1. 利用光电设备的自然物理衰减直接实现时间衰减函数；2. 将设备模拟输出作为突触权重和时间衰减的融合乘积；3. 开发量化神经网络到SNN的转换算法，支持复杂架构如Transformer；4. 完整的硬件-软件协同设计方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的能效SNN范式，将基础设备物理特性直接转化为强大的计算原语，为高效SNN设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise high energy efficiency, particularly
with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) encoding, which maximizes sparsity by emitting
at most one spike per neuron. However, such energy advantage is often
unrealized because inference requires evaluating a temporal decay function and
subsequent multiplication with the synaptic weights. This paper challenges this
costly approach by repurposing a physical hardware `bug', namely, the natural
signal decay in optoelectronic devices, as the core computation of TTFS. We
fabricated a custom indium oxide optoelectronic synapse, showing how its
natural physical decay directly implements the required temporal function. By
treating the device's analog output as the fused product of the synaptic weight
and temporal decay, optoelectronic synaptic TTFS (named Otters) eliminates
these expensive digital operations. To use the Otters paradigm in complex
architectures like the transformer, which are challenging to train directly due
to the sparsity issue, we introduce a novel quantized neural network-to-SNN
conversion algorithm. This complete hardware-software co-design enables our
model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy across seven GLUE benchmark datasets
and demonstrates a 1.77$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency over previous
leading SNNs, based on a comprehensive analysis of compute, data movement, and
memory access costs using energy measurements from a commercial 22nm process.
Our work thus establishes a new paradigm for energy-efficient SNNs, translating
fundamental device physics directly into powerful computational primitives. All
codes and data are open source.

Result: SGNNs能够恢复潜在参数，在失配情况下保持鲁棒性，在模型选择任务中错误率仅为AIC的一半。

Conclusion: SGNNs为数据受限场景下的科学预测提供了一个原则性和实用的框架。

Abstract: Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained
entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or
unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show
that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and
converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under
model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific
quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel
form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing
predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield
posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions.
SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform
classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC
in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a
principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited
regimes.

Conclusion: CR-Net通过利用层间激活残差的低秩特性，成功实现了在保持高性能的同时显著提升效率的低秩预训练框架

Abstract: Low-rank architectures have become increasingly important for efficient large
language model (LLM) pre-training, providing substantial reductions in both
parameter complexity and memory/computational demands. Despite these
advantages, current low-rank methods face three critical shortcomings: (1)
compromised model performance, (2) considerable computational overhead, and (3)
limited activation memory savings. To address these limitations, we propose
Cross-layer Low-Rank residual Network (CR-Net), an innovative
parameter-efficient framework inspired by our discovery that inter-layer
activation residuals possess low-rank properties. CR-Net implements this
insight through a dual-path architecture that efficiently reconstructs layer
activations by combining previous-layer outputs with their low-rank
differences, thereby maintaining high-rank information with minimal parameters.
We further develop a specialized activation recomputation strategy tailored for
CR-Net that dramatically reduces memory requirements. Extensive pre-training
experiments across model scales from 60M to 7B parameters demonstrate that
CR-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank frameworks while
requiring fewer computational resources and less memory.

Abstract: Representation learning from unlabeled data has been extensively studied in
statistics, data science and signal processing with a rich literature on
techniques for dimension reduction, compression, multi-dimensional scaling
among others. However, current deep learning models use new principles for
unsupervised representation learning that cannot be easily analyzed using
classical theories. For example, visual foundation models have found tremendous
success using self-supervision or denoising/masked autoencoders, which
effectively learn representations from massive amounts of unlabeled data.
However, it remains difficult to characterize the representations learned by
these models and to explain why they perform well for diverse prediction tasks
or show emergent behavior. To answer these questions, one needs to combine
mathematical tools from statistics and optimization. This paper provides an
overview of recent theoretical advances in representation learning from
unlabeled data and mentions our contributions in this direction.

Conclusion: FLNRM结合了深度强化学习的易用性和自动机的可解释性，为复杂时序任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant
challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action
pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through
symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which
provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However,
these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the
availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw
observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the
temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural
Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton
end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore
as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more
explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore,
we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL,
our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs).

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have led to
significant progress in understanding, generation, and retrieval tasks.
However, current solutions often treat these tasks in isolation or require
training LLMs from scratch, resulting in high computational costs and limited
generalization across modalities. In this work, we present OmniBridge, a
unified and modular multimodal framework that supports vision-language
understanding, generation, and retrieval within a unified architecture.
OmniBridge adopts a language-centric design that reuses pretrained LLMs and
introduces a lightweight bidirectional latent alignment module. To address the
challenge of task interference, we propose a two-stage decoupled training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning and latent space alignment for aligning LLM
behavior with multimodal reasoning, and semantic-guided diffusion training to
align cross-modal latent spaces via learnable query embeddings. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that OmniBridge
achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in all three tasks.
Moreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of latent space alignment for
unifying multimodal modeling under a shared representation space. Code and

*Kashaf Ul Emaan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer编码器的GAN混合方法，用于生成高质量的信用卡欺诈交易样本，以解决数据集极度不平衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用卡欺诈检测面临数据集高度不平衡的挑战，传统过采样方法如SMOTE生成的样本过于简单，而现有生成模型如CTGAN和TVAE在高维依赖建模方面仍有不足。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络（GAN）结合Transformer编码器块，GAN通过对抗训练生成真实样本，Transformer通过自注意力机制学习丰富的特征交互。

Result: 在公开信用卡欺诈检测数据集上的测试表明，该方法在Recall、F1-score和AUC指标上显著优于传统和生成重采样策略。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的GAN方法能有效克服欺诈检测中的严重类别不平衡问题，生成高质量少数类样本。

Abstract: Detection of credit card fraud is an acute issue of financial security
because transaction datasets are highly lopsided, with fraud cases being only a
drop in the ocean. Balancing datasets using the most popular methods of
traditional oversampling such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE) generally create simplistic synthetic samples that are not readily
applicable to complex fraud patterns. Recent industry advances that include
Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular
Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) have demonstrated increased efficiency in
tabular synthesis, yet all these models still exhibit issues with
high-dimensional dependence modelling. Now we will present our hybrid approach
where we use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Transformer encoder
block to produce realistic fraudulent transactions samples. The GAN
architecture allows training realistic generators adversarial, and the
Transformer allows the model to learn rich feature interactions by
self-attention. Such a hybrid strategy overcomes the limitations of SMOTE,
CTGAN, and TVAE by producing a variety of high-quality synthetic minority
classes samples. We test our algorithm on the publicly-available Credit Card
Fraud Detection dataset and compare it to conventional and generative
resampling strategies with a variety of classifiers, such as Logistic
Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and
Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings indicate that our Transformer-based GAN
shows substantial gains in Recall, F1-score and Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which indicates that it is effective in
overcoming the severe class imbalance inherent in the task of fraud detection.

*Yang Li,Chenyu Wang,Tingrui Wang,Yongwei Wang,Haonan Li,Zhunga Liu,Quan Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JAD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的黑盒对抗攻击框架，通过联合注意力蒸馏策略生成具有跨架构迁移性的对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有黑盒对抗攻击方法依赖特定网络架构、查询次数多、跨架构迁移性差的问题

Method: 利用CNN和ViT模型的注意力图指导潜在扩散模型生成对抗样本，聚焦不同架构共同敏感的图像区域

Result: JAD在攻击泛化性、生成效率和跨架构迁移性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: JAD为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有前景的有效范式

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

### [337] [Beyond Backpropagation: Exploring Innovative Algorithms for Energy-Efficient Deep Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19063)
*Przemysław Spyra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了三种无反向传播训练方法（FF、CaFo、MF），发现MF算法在MLP架构上不仅达到甚至超越了BP的分类精度，同时显著降低了能耗（41%）和训练时间（34%），为可持续AI发展提供了高效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的计算和能耗需求不断增长，主要受反向传播驱动，这对可持续AI发展构成挑战。本文旨在探索更节能的训练方法。

Method: 建立了严格的比较框架，在原生架构上实现三种BP-free算法（FF、CaFo、MF），使用Optuna优化超参数，基于验证性能应用一致的早停标准，并通过NVML API和CodeCarbon进行硬件级能耗分析。

Result: MF算法在MLP上不仅与BP竞争，而且持续超越其分类精度，能耗降低41%，训练时间缩短34%。MF收敛到验证损失景观中更有利的最小值，证明了无需全局优化也能达到先进结果。

Conclusion: MF算法通过结合准确性和可持续性，为未来节能深度学习提供了清晰的数据驱动路线图，挑战了所有BP-free方法都固有更内存高效的假设。

Abstract: The rising computational and energy demands of deep neural networks (DNNs),
driven largely by backpropagation (BP), challenge sustainable AI development.
This paper rigorously investigates three BP-free training methods: the
Forward-Forward (FF), Cascaded-Forward (CaFo), and Mono-Forward (MF)
algorithms, tracing their progression from foundational concepts to a
demonstrably superior solution.
  A robust comparative framework was established: each algorithm was
implemented on its native architecture (MLPs for FF and MF, a CNN for CaFo) and
benchmarked against an equivalent BP-trained model. Hyperparameters were
optimized with Optuna, and consistent early stopping criteria were applied
based on validation performance, ensuring all models were optimally tuned
before comparison.
  Results show that MF not only competes with but consistently surpasses BP in
classification accuracy on its native MLPs. Its superior generalization stems
from converging to a more favorable minimum in the validation loss landscape,
challenging the assumption that global optimization is required for
state-of-the-art results. Measured at the hardware level using the NVIDIA
Management Library (NVML) API, MF reduces energy consumption by up to 41% and
shortens training time by up to 34%, translating to a measurably smaller carbon
footprint as estimated by CodeCarbon.
  Beyond this primary result, we present a hardware-level analysis that
explains the efficiency gains: exposing FF's architectural inefficiencies,
validating MF's computationally lean design, and challenging the assumption
that all BP-free methods are inherently more memory-efficient. By documenting
the evolution from FF's conceptual groundwork to MF's synthesis of accuracy and
sustainability, this work offers a clear, data-driven roadmap for future
energy-efficient deep learning.

### [338] [Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference for Deep Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19078)
*Jian Xu,Qibin Zhao,John Paisley,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI)，一种改进的变分推断方法，通过可学习的、数据依赖的初始分布来提升深度高斯过程的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DDVI方法使用固定的无条件起始分布，与真实后验分布差距较大，导致推理轨迹效率低下和收敛缓慢。

Method: DBVI通过参数化的神经网络初始化反向扩散过程，使用ELBO目标的梯度逐步调整初始分布，减少后验差距。网络在诱导输入上操作，作为数据集的低维结构化摘要。

Result: 在回归、分类和图像重建任务中，DBVI在预测精度、收敛速度和后验质量方面一致优于DDVI和其他变分基线方法。

Conclusion: DBVI保持了DDVI的数学优雅性，同时通过可学习的初始分布显著提升了推理效率，为大规模深度高斯过程提供了可扩展的推理方案。

Abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) enable expressive hierarchical Bayesian
modeling but pose substantial challenges for posterior inference, especially
over inducing variables. Denoising diffusion variational inference (DDVI)
addresses this by modeling the posterior as a time-reversed diffusion from a
simple Gaussian prior. However, DDVI's fixed unconditional starting
distribution remains far from the complex true posterior, resulting in
inefficient inference trajectories and slow convergence. In this work, we
propose Diffusion Bridge Variational Inference (DBVI), a principled extension
of DDVI that initiates the reverse diffusion from a learnable, data-dependent
initial distribution. This initialization is parameterized via an amortized
neural network and progressively adapted using gradients from the ELBO
objective, reducing the posterior gap and improving sample efficiency. To
enable scalable amortization, we design the network to operate on the inducing
inputs, which serve as structured, low-dimensional summaries of the dataset and
naturally align with the inducing variables' shape. DBVI retains the
mathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time
SDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We
derive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI
for scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification,
and image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other
variational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior
quality.

### [339] [Graph Neural Networks with Similarity-Navigated Probabilistic Feature Copying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19084)
*Asela Hevapathige*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AxelGNN是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，基于Axelrod文化传播模型，通过相似性门控概率交互、特征级复制机制和全局极化保持，解决了GNN中的特征过度平滑、异构关系处理和特征向量不可分等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在深层网络中节点表示不可区分、难以有效处理异构关系以及将特征向量作为不可分单元处理的局限性。

Method: 提出AxelGNN架构，采用相似性门控概率交互机制自适应促进收敛或发散，实现特征级复制机制进行细粒度特征聚合，并保持全局极化以维护节点在不同表示簇中的独特性。

Result: 在节点分类和影响力估计基准测试中，AxelGNN在不同同质-异质特性的图结构上一致优于或匹配最先进的GNN方法。

Conclusion: AxelGNN通过统一的框架有效解决了GNN的多个基本限制，其双稳态收敛动力学能够自然处理同质和异质图，展现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
various graph-based tasks. However, they face some fundamental limitations:
feature oversmoothing can cause node representations to become
indistinguishable in deeper networks, they struggle to effectively manage
heterogeneous relationships where connected nodes differ significantly, and
they process entire feature vectors as indivisible units, which limits
flexibility. We seek to address these limitations. We propose AxelGNN, a novel
GNN architecture inspired by Axelrod's cultural dissemination model that
addresses these limitations through a unified framework. AxelGNN incorporates
similarity-gated probabilistic interactions that adaptively promote convergence
or divergence based on node similarity, implements trait-level copying
mechanisms for fine-grained feature aggregation at the segment level, and
maintains global polarization to preserve node distinctiveness across multiple
representation clusters. The model's bistable convergence dynamics naturally
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs within a single architecture.
Extensive experiments on node classification and influence estimation
benchmarks demonstrate that AxelGNN consistently outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art GNN methods across diverse graph structures with varying
homophily-heterophily characteristics.

### [340] [Asymptotically Optimal Problem-Dependent Bandit Policies for Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19098)
*Adrien Prevost,Timothee Mathieu,Odalric-Ambrym Maillard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了多臂老虎机问题中的迁移学习设置，推导了包含迁移参数的问题依赖渐进下界，并提出KL-UCB-Transfer策略在Gaussian情况下达到该下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在迁移学习框架下，利用源分布的先验信息来改进目标分布上的多臂老虎机性能，特别是在源分布和目标分布足够接近时。

Method: 首先推导了包含迁移参数(d_k, L_k, N'_k)的渐进下界，然后提出了KL-UCB-Transfer索引策略，该策略在Gaussian情况下能够匹配该下界。

Result: 通过仿真验证，当源分布和目标分布足够接近时，KL-UCB-Transfer策略显著优于无先验基线方法。

Conclusion: 迁移学习框架可以有效提升多臂老虎机性能，特别是在源分布和目标分布相似的情况下，KL-UCB-Transfer策略具有理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: We study the non-contextual multi-armed bandit problem in a transfer learning
setting: before any pulls, the learner is given N'_k i.i.d. samples from each
source distribution nu'_k, and the true target distributions nu_k lie within a
known distance bound d_k(nu_k, nu'_k) <= L_k. In this framework, we first
derive a problem-dependent asymptotic lower bound on cumulative regret that
extends the classical Lai-Robbins result to incorporate the transfer parameters
(d_k, L_k, N'_k). We then propose KL-UCB-Transfer, a simple index policy that
matches this new bound in the Gaussian case. Finally, we validate our approach
via simulations, showing that KL-UCB-Transfer significantly outperforms the
no-prior baseline when source and target distributions are sufficiently close.

Abstract: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical
applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against
adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we
discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable
robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in
computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training
paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of
domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to
generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test
distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art
generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image
classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language
models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that
elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,
which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based
agents.

### [342] [DRO-REBEL: Distributionally Robust Relative-Reward Regression for Fast and Efficient LLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19104)
*Sharan Sahu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-REBEL是一个统一的鲁棒REBEL更新家族，用于解决离线RLHF中的过优化问题，通过Wasserstein、KL和χ²模糊集实现分布鲁棒优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线RLHF方法存在过优化问题，模型会过度拟合奖励错误规范并偏离训练期间观察到的偏好行为。

Method: 使用Fenchel对偶将更新简化为简单的相对奖励回归，避免了PPO风格的裁剪或辅助价值网络。推导了三种散度的实用SGD算法：梯度正则化（Wasserstein）、重要性加权（KL）和快速一维对偶求解（χ²）。

Result: 在Emotion Alignment、ArmoRM多目标基准和HH-Alignment上的实验表明，该方法在未见偏好混合、模型大小和数据规模上具有强大的最坏情况鲁棒性，其中χ²-REBEL表现出持续强大的实证性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在标准线性奖励和对数线性策略类下建立了O(n^{-1/4})估计界限，通过局部Rademacher复杂性分析恢复极小极大最优O(n^{-1/2})率，并验证了无免费午餐权衡：半径收缩速度快于经验散度集中率可实现最优参数率但丧失覆盖保证，而保证覆盖的半径则产生O(n^{-1/4})率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become crucial for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent. However, existing
offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to
reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during
training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with
type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality,
each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving
scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under
standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage
condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants
than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$
rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes
the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal
parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences:
gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast
1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale
ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong
worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data
scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance.
A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii
shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve
minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while
coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.

TL;DR: CARGO是一种可扩展的多标签因果发现方法，用于处理稀疏高维事件序列，通过预训练的因果Transformer和自适应频率融合来推断因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件序列中的因果关系对于医疗保健和车辆诊断等领域至关重要，但目前仍是一个未解决的挑战，特别是在处理包含数千种事件类型的高维稀疏序列时。

Method: 使用两个预训练的因果Transformer作为领域特定的基础模型，并行推断每个序列的因果图，然后通过自适应频率融合聚合这些图来重建标签的全局马尔可夫边界。

Result: 在具有29,100个独特事件类型和474个不平衡标签的真实世界汽车故障预测数据集上，CARGO能够进行结构化推理。

Conclusion: 这种两阶段方法能够在规模上实现高效的概率推理，同时避免了全数据集条件独立性测试的不可行成本。

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as
diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error
codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like
healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label
causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising
of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as
domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in
parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an
adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of
labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at
scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional
independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault
prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced
labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFiTS是一个结合信任和公平的联邦学习框架，通过基于适应度的客户端选举和分槽聚合来提升联邦学习在非IID数据、客户端不可靠性和对抗攻击等挑战下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在敏感领域（如医疗）部署面临非IID数据、客户端不可靠性和对抗操纵等持续挑战，需要更鲁棒和公平的解决方案。

Method: FedFiTS采用三阶段参与策略（自由训练、自然选择和分槽团队参与），结合动态客户端评分、自适应阈值和基于队列的调度，平衡收敛效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 在医学影像、视觉基准和表格农业数据上的实验表明，FedFiTS在准确性、达到目标时间和对投毒攻击的韧性方面持续优于FedAvg、FedRand和FedPow。

Conclusion: 通过整合信任感知聚合和公平导向的客户端选择，FedFiTS推进了可扩展和安全的联邦学习，使其非常适合现实世界的医疗和跨领域部署。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
privacy-preserving model training, yet deployments in sensitive domains such as
healthcare face persistent challenges from non-IID data, client unreliability,
and adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces FedFiTS, a trust and
fairness-aware selective FL framework that advances the FedFaSt line by
combining fitness-based client election with slotted aggregation. FedFiTS
implements a three-phase participation strategy-free-for-all training, natural
selection, and slotted team participation-augmented with dynamic client
scoring, adaptive thresholding, and cohort-based scheduling to balance
convergence efficiency with robustness. A theoretical convergence analysis
establishes bounds for both convex and non-convex objectives under standard
assumptions, while a communication-complexity analysis shows reductions
relative to FedAvg and other baselines. Experiments on diverse datasets-medical
imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular
agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently
outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and
resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with
fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL,
making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的架构和参数特征，特别是权重特征，以分析模型间的相关性和差异。

Method: 提出标准差向量（假设权重服从正态分布，对投影矩阵标准差归一化）和聚类向量（对权重投影矩阵奇异值进行K-Means聚类）来描述模型特征。

Result: 两种向量能有效区分不同模型，清晰显示同家族模型的相似性。LoRA微调后，权重分布受数据集影响，但权重相关性保持不变。

Conclusion: 标准差向量和聚类向量是分析大语言模型权重特征的有效工具，能揭示模型间的差异和相似性，特别是在微调过程中权重相关性的稳定性。

Abstract: The study on architecture and parameter characteristics remains the hot topic
in the research of large language models. In this paper we concern with the
characteristics of weight which are used to analyze the correlations and
differences between models. Two kinds of vectors-standard deviation vector and
clustering vector-are proposed to describe features of models. In the first
case, the weights are assumed to follow normal distribution. The standard
deviation values of projection matrices are normalized to form
Standard-Deviation Vector, representing the distribution characteristics of
models. In the second case, the singular values from each weight projection
matrix are extracted and grouped by K-Means algorithm. The grouped data with
the same type matrix are combined as Clustering Vector to represent the
correlation characteristics of models' weights. The study reveals that these
two vectors can effectively distinguish between different models and clearly
show the similarities among models of the same family. Moreover, after
conducting LoRA fine-tuning with different datasets and models, it is found
that the distribution of weights represented by standard deviation vector is
directly influenced by the dataset, but the correlations between different
weights represented by clustering vector remain unaffected and maintain a high
consistency with the pre-trained model.

Conclusion: PipelineRL在硬件效率和数据实时性之间实现了优越的平衡，并提供了可扩展的开源实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling
these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the
difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating
stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces
PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between
hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs
concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by
the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation
engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the
generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator
utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on
long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL
achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL
baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and
modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key
contribution.

Abstract: Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a
unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle
regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal
framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the
semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of
four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE)
integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal
rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory
Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and
behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively.
Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference
cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance
interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads
transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream
tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world
datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate
performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user
identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and
substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of
GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond
raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling
provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient
reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While
recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they
mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand
what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic
forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation
functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on
catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals
that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation
functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this
insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation
functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show
that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant
activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can
significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic
forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and
memory-efficient.

### [349] [Unveiling the Role of Learning Rate Schedules via Functional Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19189)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了功能缩放定律（FSL），通过随机梯度下降的随机微分方程建模，揭示了学习率调度对LLM训练过程中损失动态的影响，并理论证明了常见训练实践的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要关注最终损失，忽略了训练过程中的损失动态和学习率调度的影响，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用师生核回归设置，通过在线随机梯度下降训练，引入内在时间视角和随机微分方程建模，建立功能缩放定律框架。

Result: FSL能够准确捕捉不同学习率调度的影响，理论证明了高容量模型更高效、学习率衰减提升效率、WSD调度优于直接衰减等经验实践。

Conclusion: FSL框架深化了对LLM预训练动态的理解，为大规模模型训练提供了理论指导和优化工具。

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a cornerstone role in guiding the training of large
language models (LLMs). However, most existing works on scaling laws primarily
focus on the final-step loss, overlooking the loss dynamics during the training
process and, crucially, the impact of learning rate schedule (LRS). In this
paper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel
regression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
Leveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential
equation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),
which characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training
process for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured
through an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects
fully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used
LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under
both data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical
justification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such
as (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)
learning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules
can outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical
relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing
the loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model
sizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen
the understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for
improving large-scale model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习分类器在干净数据集上表现优异，但对对抗性扰动和常见数据失真等扰动非常脆弱，传统方法依赖扰动测试数据集来评估模型性能，但这种方法不够敏感和早期。

Method: 从训练数据集中通过局部鲁棒性分析提取"弱鲁棒"样本，这些样本对扰动最敏感，作为模型脆弱性的指示器，在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上进行验证。

Result: 该方法能够更细致地理解模型的鲁棒性，为有针对性的性能提升提供信息，在对抗性和常见失真场景下显著提高模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于弱鲁棒样本的鲁棒性验证方法能够有效驱动模型在对抗性和常见失真场景下的可靠性改进，为模型鲁棒性评估提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Data-driven models, especially deep learning classifiers often demonstrate
great success on clean datasets. Yet, they remain vulnerable to common data
distortions such as adversarial and common corruption perturbations. These
perturbations can significantly degrade performance, thereby challenging the
overall reliability of the models. Traditional robustness validation typically
relies on perturbed test datasets to assess and improve model performance. In
our framework, however, we propose a validation approach that extracts "weak
robust" samples directly from the training dataset via local robustness
analysis. These samples, being the most susceptible to perturbations, serve as
an early and sensitive indicator of the model's vulnerabilities. By evaluating
models on these challenging training instances, we gain a more nuanced
understanding of its robustness, which informs targeted performance
enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on models trained
with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, highlighting how robustness validation
guided by weak robust samples can drive meaningful improvements in model
reliability under adversarial and common corruption scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFusion是一个联邦迁移学习框架，通过统一域适应和节俭标注技术，结合多样性/聚类感知编码器，解决联邦学习中的异构特征空间、非IID数据和标签稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的联邦学习面临异构特征空间、严重非IID数据和跨客户端标签稀缺的挑战，需要一种能够同时处理个性化、域适应和标签效率的解决方案。

Method: 使用标记的教师客户端通过置信度过滤的伪标签和域自适应迁移指导学习者客户端，同时客户端维护针对本地数据定制的个性化编码器。采用相似性加权分类器耦合（可选聚类平均）来保持全局一致性，并通过自监督/半监督预训练与选择性微调的结合减少标注需求。

Result: 在表格和图像基准测试中，FedFusion在IID、非IID和标签稀缺情况下，在准确性、鲁棒性和公平性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法，同时保持相当的通信和计算预算。

Conclusion: 协调个性化、域适应和标签效率是应对现实世界约束下鲁棒联邦学习的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning in practice must contend with heterogeneous feature
spaces, severe non-IID data, and scarce labels across clients. We present
FedFusion, a federated transfer-learning framework that unifies domain
adaptation and frugal labelling with diversity-/cluster-aware encoders (DivEn,
DivEn-mix, DivEn-c). Labelled teacher clients guide learner clients via
confidence-filtered pseudo-labels and domain-adaptive transfer, while clients
maintain personalised encoders tailored to local data. To preserve global
coherence under heterogeneity, FedFusion employs similarity-weighted classifier
coupling (with optional cluster-wise averaging), mitigating dominance by
data-rich sites and improving minority-client performance. The frugal-labelling
pipeline combines self-/semi-supervised pretext training with selective
fine-tuning, reducing annotation demands without sharing raw data. Across
tabular and imaging benchmarks under IID, non-IID, and label-scarce regimes,
FedFusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy,
robustness, and fairness while maintaining comparable communication and
computation budgets. These results show that harmonising personalisation,
domain adaptation, and label efficiency is an effective recipe for robust
federated learning under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have enabled the creation
of high-fidelity, temporally coherent clips from natural language prompts. Yet
these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy
demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study
of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V
models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling
laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps.
We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on
WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and
linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our
analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles
under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and
practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative
video systems.

Abstract: In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of
renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are
encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid
stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators
are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before
implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are
often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as
fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,
Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are
also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an
ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from
incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised
losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics
equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called
LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical
compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The
results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across
these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the
corresponding Github page.

Motivation: 虽然对抗训练能增强模型鲁棒性，但存在鲁棒过拟合和泛化差距扩大的问题。现有研究已证明去中心化网络中对抗训练的收敛性，但其泛化特性尚未探索

Method: 采用基于稳定性的泛化分析方法，针对扩散策略下的对抗训练，在凸损失函数条件下进行理论推导

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了理论预测，为去中心化对抗训练的泛化性能提供了理论分析框架

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization.
While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from
robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has
established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks,
its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a
stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the
diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the
generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and
the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but
novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression
validate these theoretical predictions.

*Yunzhen Feng,Julia Kempe,Cheng Zhang,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型推理模型中，更长的思维链（CoT）和更多的回顾步骤并不总是带来更好的性能，反而与更低的准确性相关。作者提出了失败步骤分数（FSF）这一指标，能更好地预测CoT的正确性，并通过干预实验证明减少失败分支可以显著提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在测试时需要大量的计算资源来生成长思维链，但什么构成了有效的思维链仍不清楚。先前研究认为更长的CoT和更多的回顾步骤能提高性能，但近期研究表明短思维可能优于长思维。作者旨在系统评估CoT的有效性特征。

Method: 在10个大型推理模型上对数学和科学推理任务进行系统评估；引入CoT的图视图来提取结构；提出失败步骤分数（FSF）指标；设计两种干预实验：基于指标对候选CoT进行排名测试，以及编辑CoT移除失败分支。

Result: 发现CoT延长和回顾增加与准确性降低相关；FSF指标在预测正确性方面优于长度和回顾比率；基于FSF的排名选择能带来最大的pass@1增益；移除失败分支能显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 有效的CoT特征是失败较少，支持结构感知的测试时扩展，而不是盲目生成长CoT。失败分支会对后续推理产生偏见，减少失败分支能改善推理质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long
chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT
remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and
increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent
studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We
therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and
scientific reasoning. Contrary to the "longer-is-better" narrative, we find
that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with
*lower* accuracy.
  As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with
process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and
identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of
steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review
ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two
interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where
FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed
branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed
branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize
effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware*
test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯面元的高效可微分光传输框架，结合辐射度理论，在球谐系数空间中实现全局光照，支持漫反射和镜面反射材料，实现了无需重新计算光传输的视图无关渲染。

Conclusion: 该框架在稀疏数据集下表现出优越性能，为高质量全局光照渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Text Slider提供了一个高效、轻量级的解决方案，解决了现有概念控制方法的可扩展性和适应性限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.
