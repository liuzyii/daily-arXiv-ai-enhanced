*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的下一个词概率（NTP）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来高效识别VLM生成文本中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM产生的幻觉（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）会削弱模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用VLM自身或其他模型来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算量大且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 使用VLM的下一个词概率（NTP）作为模型不确定性的直接量化指标，假设高不确定性（低NTP值）与幻觉强相关。构建了包含1,400个人工标注语句的数据集，训练轻量级ML模型进行检测。还探索了将语言NTP（仅将生成文本反馈给VLM计算）与VLM的幻觉预测分数集成的方法。

Result: NTP特征是有价值的幻觉预测因子，使简单ML模型能达到与强大VLM相当的性能。语言NTP的增强进一步提升了检测性能，而将VLM预测分数与NTP模型集成可获得比单独使用任一方法更好的效果。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，有助于提高VLM的可靠性，展示了基于NTP的方法在高效幻觉检测方面的潜力。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证在独立作者设置下的泛化问题，通过生成SPD矩阵空间的合成数据来训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立作者设置下具有挑战性，现有方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，但真实数据获取困难且成本高。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过黎曼高斯混合模型生成合成作者和签名特征，使用度量学习框架处理相似和不相似的SPD点对。

Result: 在两个流行签名数据集上的实验表明，该方法在内部和跨数据集评估协议下都能实现低错误率。

Conclusion: 在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立作者签名验证系统具有巨大潜力，能够有效解决数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和优化的VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统的文本到图像系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创意工具，推动生成式AI在创意和专业应用中的边界。

Method: 开发高效的扩散变换器与强大的VAE，减少图像token数量；采用多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务；集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等推理加速技术。

Result: 在生成2K图像时推理时间可达1.8秒（不使用LLM/VLM作为PE模型），在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，展示出在复杂任务中的卓越多模态能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更具交互性和多维度的创意工具，为创意和专业应用推动了生成式AI的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习的乳腺癌检测框架，使用Resnet-50在半监督设置下训练，在INbreast和MIAS数据集上达到96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死亡原因，早期检测对治疗效果至关重要。传统CAD系统依赖传统图像分析，而深度学习虽然更有效但受限于标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，使用Resnet-50在半监督方式下训练，利用大量未标注的乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能，最后在小规模标注数据上进行微调。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的对比学习框架能够有效解决深度学习在医学图像分析中标注数据不足的问题，在乳腺癌检测任务上取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力来替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型部署成本。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在零样本设置下的性能。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的直接应用存在局限性，需要针对工业环境的特定优化。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器架构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI模型针对特定高精度任务定制，在需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用中效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，使多个视觉任务可以在共享的神经空间中高效执行。

Result: 实验证明，去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块可以在NS中高效执行，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量且硬件兼容性更好。

Conclusion: NS架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效的多任务视觉流水线奠定了基础，特别适合需要模块化任务的应用场景。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘设备上选择最有用的训练图像，以在保持传输成本低的同时最大化模型质量。研究表明，结合高置信度流式策略和多样性方法可以在类似训练负载下，用最少的数据集查询产生高质量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂教师模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练适应有限计算能力的边缘设备的小模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择最有用的训练图像。

Result: 在类似训练负载（即迭代次数）下，该方法能够用最少的数据集查询产生高质量模型。

Conclusion: 结合高置信度流式策略和多样性方法是在边缘设备训练中平衡模型质量和传输成本的有效策略。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的样式控制，支持单件或多件服装的试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且在某些复杂场景下无法实现（如卷起长袖衬衫的袖子）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，无需精确绘制掩码，并自动化执行多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了最先进的结果和样式控制。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，解决了传统掩码方法的局限性，提供了更灵活和强大的虚拟试穿能力。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个基于深度学习的指纹识别模型，专门用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对不同难度级别的篡改指纹实现了高准确率（96.7%-99.54%），但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 篡改指纹识别在边境管控、法医鉴定和财政准入等应用中具有重要安全意义，攻击者可能故意修改指纹纹理以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较特征嵌入，在SOCOFing Real-Altered数据集的三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别上的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%；但当阈值从0.92放宽到0.72时，准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet通过使用真实篡改样本和分级评估，克服了先前基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的研究局限，表明其已具备在实际部署中同时满足安全性和识别鲁棒性要求的潜力，但阈值选择对系统性能至关重要。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 利用预训练ViT模型的注意力图作为像素级显著性分数，为机器人操作提供语义线索

Method: 从DINOv2提取注意力图，将其提升到3D体素网格中，并整合到行为克隆策略中

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，平均绝对提升8.2%，相对增益21.9%

Conclusion: 注意力引导的特征化方法能显著提升体素基础策略的双手操作性能

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究对YOLO和RT-DETR系列共36个实时目标检测模型进行了蓝莓检测的基准测试，使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，并通过半监督学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要大规模多样化数据集和合适的精度/速度/内存权衡的检测模型。

Method: 使用新构建的661张蓝莓冠层图像数据集评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)系列模型，并采用无偏均值教师半监督学习方法在1,035张未标注图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50，半监督学习后RT-DETR-v2-X最高达到94.8% mAP@50。中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了蓝莓检测的全面基准分析，公开了数据集和软件程序，建议进一步研究半监督学习以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域(ROI)增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量，性能有待提升。

Method: 在训练过程中，使用预计算的标签无关边界框库随机采样ROI裁剪来概率性地替换完整图像，可选抖动增加变异性，推理时成本不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来了适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有差异，PR-AUC持平或略低。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在不增加额外标签或修改架构的情况下，在受限环境中增强乳腺X光片分类性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

TL;DR: 利用镜面反射作为辅助视图构建虚拟相机，实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建过程并提高鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜面反射在日常环境中常见，能提供单次拍摄中的立体信息，利用反射作为虚拟视图可以简化成像过程

Method: 设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换，直接生成虚拟视图像素；提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计；扩展到动态场景的逐帧几何恢复

Result: 构建了包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集进行定量评估，在真实和合成数据上的实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现高效、通用的3D重建，特别适用于动态场景

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街景级别的语言引导框架，通过全景视频与地块关联、立面视图校正和可解释属性提取，实现灾后建筑占用情况的准确评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用情况评估对于分类、检查、公用事业重新供电和公平资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像细节丰富但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频到地块、校正立面视图、提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了残余错误发生的位置和原因。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过针对性质量控制提高评估准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单的移动形状识别社会互动，发现语义表征对视觉特征具有补充作用，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在社会互动感知中使用的语义表征，补充以往主要关注视觉特征的研究，探索视觉特征与语义表征的关系。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记移动形状动画的印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社会互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 人类反应呈分布状态；语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息；基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社会互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 现有跨视角地理定位方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 在无人机不同方向和视野下严重外观变化的鲁棒性问题，(2) 建立同时捕获全局语义和局部细节的可靠对应关系。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构实现全局语义聚合和局部区域重分布。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中，EGS实现了显著的性能提升，建立了跨领域CVGL的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合几何感知特征提取和全局-局部一致性建模，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Motivation: 红外小目标缺乏明显的纹理和形态特征，容易与杂乱背景融合。现有方法依赖固定梯度算子或简单注意力机制，在低对比度和高噪声环境下无法准确提取目标边缘。

Method: 采用双路径架构：第一条路径使用双向交互模块（局部自注意力和全局自注意力）捕获多尺度特征依赖；第二条路径使用多边缘细化器，通过级联泰勒有限差分算子和注意力门控机制增强边缘细节。

Result: 该方法能够精确地定位和增强不同尺寸目标的边缘特征，同时有效抑制噪声，为红外小目标检测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络在统一框架中结合了结构语义和边缘细化，解决了红外小目标检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意图识别主要关注个体意图，忽视了群体环境中集体意图的复杂性。为了填补这一研究空白，需要研究群体意图的预测问题。

Method: 提出了SHOT数据集（包含1,979个篮球视频片段，5个相机视角，6种个体属性标注）和GIFT框架（提取细粒度个体特征并建模群体动态演化）。

Result: 实验结果表明SHOT数据集和GIFT框架的有效性，为群体意图预测研究奠定了坚实基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为群体意图预测领域开辟了新方向，数据集和框架为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: Neptune-X是一个数据中心的生成-选择框架，通过合成数据生成和任务感知样本选择来解决海事目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海事目标检测面临两个关键挑战：标注数据稀缺以及在不同海事属性（如目标类别、视角、位置和成像环境）上的泛化能力差。现有数据集训练的模型在代表性不足的场景（如开阔海域环境）中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Neptune-X框架，包含两个核心组件：1）X-to-Maritime多模态条件生成模型，通过双向目标-水域注意力模块捕捉物体与水域边界的交互；2）属性相关主动采样方法，根据任务相关性动态选择合成样本。还构建了首个面向生成式海事学习的海事生成数据集。

Result: 实验表明该方法在海事场景合成方面设立了新的基准，显著提高了检测精度，特别是在具有挑战性和代表性不足的设置中。

Conclusion: Neptune-X通过数据中心的生成-选择方法有效解决了海事目标检测中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为海事场景合成和检测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: STELLA是首个用于长期月球测绘的端到端陨石坑导航管道，结合了Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑位姿求解器和批量轨道确定后端。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航主要针对短时动力下降任务，而月球测绘任务涉及稀疏、倾斜图像采集，在变化光照条件下持续可能一年，对位姿估计提出了更大挑战。

Method: STELLA管道包括：基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑位姿求解器、批量轨道确定后端。使用CRESENT-365数据集进行测试，该数据集模拟一年期月球测绘任务。

Result: 在CRESENT+和CRESENT-365上的实验显示，STELLA在广泛的视角、光照条件和月球纬度范围内，平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境中对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务应考虑的操作条件提供了参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了单模态视觉和语言模型在表征空间中的对齐现象，发现这种对齐出现在模型的中后层，反映了从模态特定表征到概念共享表征的转变，且与人类判断一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有研究表明深度视觉和语言模型在不相交模态上训练后仍能部分对齐表征空间，但对这种对齐的具体位置、支持因素、与人类偏好的关系以及示例聚合的影响仍缺乏清晰认识。

Method: 通过分析模型不同层的表征对齐情况，测试对视觉外观变化和语义变化的鲁棒性，设计强制选择的"Pick-a-Pic"任务评估人类偏好与模型嵌入空间的匹配度，并研究示例嵌入平均对对齐的影响。

Result: 对齐在两种模型类型的中后层达到峰值；对仅外观变化具有鲁棒性，但对语义变化（如物体移除或词序打乱）敏感；人类对图像-标题匹配的偏好与所有视觉-语言模型对的嵌入空间一致；示例嵌入平均反而增强了对齐而非模糊细节。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于一个共享的语义代码，该代码与人类判断一致，并通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在三个主要问题：缺乏对插入对象的几何控制、风格一致性不足、以及需要大量训练。这些问题限制了图像编辑的精确性和真实感。

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像。通过扩散适配器实现风格和内容控制，结合几何控制生成最终编辑图像。

Result: 该方法能够生成具有精确几何控制（如形状和视角）和风格一致性的编辑图像，无需额外训练即可实现高质量的对象插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过引入3D几何信息有效解决了现有图像编辑方法的局限性，为个性化对象插入提供了更精确和真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,
given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Result: 在Fundus、Polyp和SCGM等真实医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，DAC框架具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG场景下的挑战，为医学图像分割中的域泛化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2是基于DEIM框架的改进版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和Spatial Tuning Adapter，在不同规模模型上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在多个模型尺寸上创下了新的最先进结果。

Motivation: 扩展DEIM框架以利用DINOv3特征的强大语义表示能力，同时针对不同部署场景（GPU、边缘设备、移动设备）开发从X到Atto的八种模型尺寸，实现更好的性能-成本权衡。

Method: 对于X、L、M、S变体采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，并引入Spatial Tuning Adapter将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型使用HGNetv2进行深度和宽度剪枝，配合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一设计在不同规模模型上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在实时目标检测领域建立了新的技术标杆，特别是在轻量级模型方面表现出色。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA是一种将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中的新框架，通过动态对抗课程学习提升视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持清洁准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等安全关键应用中广泛使用，但即使使用LoRA等参数高效微调方法，这些模型仍然容易受到对抗攻击的威胁。CLIP作为众多下游VLMs的骨干网络，其脆弱性可能在整个多模态AI生态系统中产生连锁影响。

Method: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，核心原理是基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES启发式损失函数，构建智能的渐进式攻击课程。该方法可以应用于任何迭代攻击方法，通过动态调整对抗样本的难度来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: DAC-LoRA在对抗鲁棒性方面取得了显著提升，同时没有显著损害清洁准确率。该方法轻量级且具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA框架可以轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中，显著增强模型的鲁棒性，为解决视觉语言模型的安全漏洞提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦领域泛化方法FedDSPG，通过生成领域特定软提示来处理未知领域的下游任务，在多个公共数据集上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦领域泛化方法学习的提示多样性有限，且容易忽略未知领域的信息。

Method: 提出FedDSPG方法，在训练阶段为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端间的生成模型中；在推理阶段利用生成器获取未知目标领域的DSPs来指导下游任务。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦领域泛化任务中优于现有强基线。

Conclusion: 从生成视角提出的FedDSPG方法能有效处理联邦领域泛化任务，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs在视频理解方面表现出色，但之前的研究已发现早期采样策略存在漏洞，而提示引导采样的安全性尚未被探索。

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过从有害描述的转述构建描述集，利用影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型GPT-4o-mini，迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧的相关性得分。

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上的全面评估显示，PoisonVID达到了82%-99%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLMs开发更先进采样策略的重要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数动态平衡任务特定损失和知识蒸馏损失，解决了量化感知训练中梯度冲突问题，显著提升了小量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，由于异质梯度幅度导致性能受限。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数自适应平衡TS和KD目标；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异质教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务中，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法；在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率；EKD-GoR在最优条件下可超越全精度模型。

Conclusion: GoR为现实世界部署提供了稳健解决方案，能够有效解决量化训练中的损失平衡问题，提升小量化模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有机构收集植物图像数据，但大多数植物物种仍缺乏图像或图像质量差。网络上有大量植物图片但存在标签错误，需要评估这种噪声数据的可用性。

Method: 使用两种训练策略对比：大规模网络收集的噪声数据集（含标签错误）vs 小型专家验证数据集。测试集来自第三方Pl@ntNet移动应用的真实用户查询数据。

Result: 挑战赛评估了不同研究组的方法和系统，分析了两种训练策略在10,000种植物识别任务上的性能差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模植物识别系统提供了重要基准，探索了网络噪声数据在植物识别中的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性，每年都有新品种培育，不可能为所有物种建立依赖物种的计数模型。现有类无关计数模型对非刚性植物结构计数效果不佳，需要重新思考植物计数的问题表述。

Method: 基于普通视觉Transformer构建TasselNetV4，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集PAC-105和PAC-Somalia上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计量的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT图像分割中存在解剖学不合理分割、层-病变交互建模不足以及缺乏拓扑正确性保证等问题，需要开发能够强制执行解剖学约束的模型。

Method: 提出包含完全可微分生物标志物拓扑引擎的半监督模型，实现层与病变的双向联合学习，采用解耦表示学习分离空间和风格因素，利用未标记和部分标记数据集进行训练。

Result: 在公开和内部OCT扫描数据集上的评估表明，该模型在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，同时展示了使用部分标注训练数据将层分割泛化到病理病例的能力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在半监督学习中应用解剖学约束对于实现准确、鲁棒和可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用LLM作为知识引擎，但图像描述通常包含与问题无关的噪声，且LLM不擅长理解VQA任务，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，通过上下文示例生成、总结和重排序描述来排除无关信息，帮助LLM更好地理解图像和问题。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，基于6.7B参数的LLM表现出色。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过改进的图像描述处理机制有效提升了知识型VQA的性能，证明了在不进行端到端训练的情况下增强LLM推理能力的可行性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化中保真度目标和对抗目标作为优化目标的有效性与其作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一关联尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，并研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化中的表现存在不对称性；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用，补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案能提供更忠实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受到训练数据偏差影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化问题。需要同时处理对象交互和数据集偏差问题。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，集成对象交互自注意力机制捕获图像内对象复杂关系，使用GAN框架生成无偏数据分布学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和v2数据集上表现优异，特别在处理有偏和不平衡数据分布方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏差对推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 视频序列常包含结构化噪声和背景伪影，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数正则化和扩散模型先验实现视频分解。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强(gCNR)和信号保持(KS统计量)方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验的方法在高保真视频恢复方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

*Shuqiao Liang,Jian Liu,Renzhang Chen,Quanlong Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FerretNet，一种轻量级神经网络，通过分析生成过程中引入的潜在分布偏差和解码诱导平滑效应，实现高效的合成图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。需要解决生成过程中引入的伪影问题。

Method: 利用基于马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性，重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出FerretNet轻量网络（仅110万参数）。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中达到97.1%的平均准确率，比现有最优方法提升10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析生成伪影实现了高效鲁棒的合成图像检测，在轻量级设计下取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于概念瓶颈模型的视频分类框架，通过处理视频中的时间依赖性来提升可解释性，支持全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，无法有效处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而时间依赖性对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 提出MoTIF框架，采用transformer架构，将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频分类，处理任意长度的视频序列，识别重复出现的概念模式（motifs）。

Result: 实验结果表明，概念建模范式可以有效地应用于视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能的同时，更好地理解概念在时间上下文中的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频领域，为视频分类提供了更好的可解释性，同时保持了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Motivation: 解决在可见光和热成像模态下使用少量标注数据进行目标检测的挑战，特别是在复杂照明和环境条件下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 使用可变形注意力机制有效结合可见光和热成像图像的独特优势，实现跨模态特征整合。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在低数据量的挑战性场景下实现了有效的目标检测性能，优于多个基于最先进模型建立的基线方法。

Conclusion: FSMODNet框架通过跨模态特征整合显著提升了少样本多光谱目标检测的性能，在复杂条件下表现出良好的适应性。

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用粒子滤波器解决基于相机测量的3D物体定位问题，特别适用于无人机野火监测等安全关键任务。该方法在计算资源受限或目标距离较远的情况下，能够替代密集深度估计或3D场景重建等传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机野火监测等安全关键任务中，需要对相机检测到的物体进行3D定位。传统方法如密集深度估计或3D场景重建在目标距离较远或计算资源受限时不可行，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理单目标和多目标场景的3D定位问题。方法基于相机位姿和图像分割结果，通过3D仿真和基于GNSS的无人机图像分割序列进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，粒子滤波器能够有效解决基于相机位姿和图像分割的实用定位任务，特别是在其他方法失效的情况下。该方法与检测方法无关，具有很好的灵活性。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器为无人机野火监测等应用提供了一种可行的3D定位解决方案，能够与现有的图像分割模型配合使用，在资源受限环境下表现出色。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

### [44] [SwinMamba: A hybrid local-global mamba framework for enhancing semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20918)
*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba是一个新颖的语义分割框架，结合了Swin Transformer的局部窗口扫描和Vision Mamba的全局感受野，用于解决遥感图像分割中局部特征被忽视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多样物体尺度的挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但倾向于忽视关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），这些特征对于遥感图像的准确分割至关重要。

Method: 提出SwinMamba框架，在前两个阶段执行局部扫描以捕获细粒度细节，在后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合更广泛的上下文信息。通过重叠的移位窗口增强区域间信息交换，实现更鲁棒的特征整合。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba在遥感图像语义分割中表现出卓越的有效性和潜力，是一个优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

### [45] [Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923)
*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多实例学习框架，用于解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化、数据异质性和监督有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的长度变化和有限的监督，这些极端变化导致数据高度异质性和冗余，传统方法往往在训练效率和优化上做出妥协。

Method: 采用打包的多实例学习框架，将采样的变长特征序列打包成固定长度序列以支持批处理训练；引入残差分支将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法能有效处理序列长度变化和有限监督问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff是一种模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时重复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层纳入扩散过程以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高昂且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时重复模拟器调用，并提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: SimDiff成功泛化到未见过的环境参数组合，展示了组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉架构对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，通过评估1174个预训练模型识别出四个关键设计模式，并提供了理论解释和实用设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉模型的鲁棒性经常被测量，但特定架构设计选择对其的影响很少被剖析。本文旨在理解为什么某些视觉架构对高斯噪声具有固有鲁棒性。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别出四个一致的设计模式，并通过理论分析解释这些发现。

Result: 发现四个关键设计模式可显著提高鲁棒性：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化、监督ViT而非CLIP ViT，可获得高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并为设计更鲁棒的视觉模型提供了实用的即插即用指南。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，使SSL学习器能够在无任何先决条件下冷启动进行深度图像聚类，无需预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为先决条件，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从无标签数据中随机采样伪标签数据；2. 设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；3. 跟踪预测的类别转换提取实例级类别的高层相似性；4. 为伪标签数据分配聚类级标签；5. 使用带聚类级标签的伪标签数据触发通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Conclusion: ASD实现了SSL学习器的冷启动图像聚类，无需任何先决条件，具有优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽略信息信号，限制了从大模型中获得的收益

Method: SiNGER框架采用零空间引导的扰动方法，在教师特征精炼过程中保持信息完整性同时抑制伪影，通过LoRA适配器实现高效扰动，然后将精炼后的教师特征蒸馏给学生模型

Result: 实验表明SiNGER能持续提升学生模型性能，在多个下游任务中达到最先进水平，并产生更清晰、更可解释的表征

Conclusion: SiNGER有效解决了教师模型伪影问题，在保持信息信号的同时抑制伪影，为知识蒸馏提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI为星载云分割提供了一种高效、灵活的解决方案，适用于空间合格硬件平台

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SNCE方法，通过操纵单个神经元实现精确的有害概念擦除，在保持图像质量的同时有效防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有概念擦除方法难以在精确移除目标概念的同时最小化图像质量退化。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器将文本嵌入映射到稀疏解耦的潜在空间，设计基于调制频率评分的神经元识别方法定位有害概念相关神经元，通过抑制该神经元激活实现精确概念擦除。

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，为文本到图像模型的安全应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KD-SS算法用于植物器官点云分割，无需降采样即可处理全分辨率点云数据，适用于多种传感器和植物物种


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物器官点云分割方法存在物种和传感器特异性，且需要大量预处理和降采样来满足硬件要求

Method: 开发KD-SS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，该算法对传感器数据和植物物种具有通用性，能够保留原始分辨率

Result: 结合最先进的分割模型，在摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR等多种模态上获得满意结果

Conclusion: KD-SS是植物器官分割的轻量级替代方案，无需依赖特定物种和传感器模态的密集预处理和降采样方法

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的前景-背景分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前景-背景分解方法在少样本分布外检测中往往由于过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略而具有较低的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获得包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优来灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置方面相比最先进方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过结合细化的局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，减少了先前方法对局部类别相似性的依赖，并通过灵活的补丁选择策略解决了固定背景提取的问题。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种图像分割数据集划分方法：IPS（迭代像素分层）和WDES（Wasserstein驱动的进化分层），旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性问题，提高模型评估的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 1. IPS：基于现有分层概念的简单标签感知采样方法；2. WDES：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分中标签分布的相似性，理论上证明在足够代数下具有全局最优性。

Result: 使用新提出的统计异质性指标评估，WDES相比随机采样始终产生更具代表性的划分。在街景、医学影像和卫星图像等多种分割任务中应用WDES，实现了更低的性能方差和更好的模型评估效果。

Conclusion: WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值，这些情况下传统划分策略最容易产生偏差。该方法显著提高了分割模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net是一种利用语义层次结构（分类法）作为监督信号的端到端深度神经网络模型，用于细粒度分类，无需裁剪技术或手动标注即可达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细粒度分类模型大多依赖部件标注或复杂技术来自动提取注意力图，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此作者提出利用层次化的语义关联作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义层次结构（分类法）作为监督信号集成到端到端的深度神经网络中，无需裁剪技术或手动标注。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个知名数据集上的广泛实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的近期方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度分类提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 本文研究了对抗性补丁从卷积神经网络(CNNs)到视觉变换器(ViTs)的可迁移性，发现ViTs对对抗性攻击存在显著脆弱性，攻击成功率在不同模型间差异很大(40.04%-99.97%)，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统的广泛应用，其安全性变得至关重要。视觉变换器(ViTs)虽然在性能上优于卷积神经网络(CNNs)且对对抗性扰动更具鲁棒性，但仍存在安全漏洞，特别是对对抗性补丁攻击的脆弱性。

Method: 使用褶皱变换(CT)技术设计逼真的对抗性补丁，在人物与非人物分类任务中测试四个微调ViT模型的脆弱性，评估CNN对抗攻击技术向ViT分类模型的迁移性。

Result: 实验结果显示不同ViT模型的脆弱性差异显著：攻击成功率从40.04%(google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k)到99.97%(facebook/dino-vitb16)不等，其他两个模型分别达到66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 研究证实了对抗性补丁从CNNs到ViTs的跨架构可迁移性，预训练数据集规模和方法是影响模型对抗攻击鲁棒性的关键因素。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer是一种新颖的视频概念迁移架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移。该方法将视频分解为前景主体、背景和运动流三个关键组件，并采用双到单流DiT架构进行细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频概念迁移方法缺乏精确的控制能力，无法对视频的不同组件进行细粒度编辑。作者希望通过空间和时间步分解来实现更精确可控的视频概念迁移。

Method: 1) 空间分解：将视频分解为前景主体、背景和运动流；2) 双到单流DiT架构：支持对不同组件的细粒度控制；3) 基于随机掩码的自监督预训练策略；4) Chain-of-Prompt机制：将去噪过程分解为三个不同粒度的阶段，利用LLM生成阶段特定指令。

Result: 在广泛的实验中，该方法在多样化的参考图像和场景中实现了高质量和可控的视频概念迁移，在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步分解的渐进式范式，成功实现了精确可控的视频概念迁移，为视频编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用LLM推理来分析解析后的视觉内容，但受限于静态感知阶段，无法实现动态的迭代感知和推理优化。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知（ITP）机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理过程，逐步聚焦高置信度的时空区域。

Result: 实验表明VTTS在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，Videochat-R1.5模型在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLMs的性能，验证了迭代感知在增强多模态推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Motivation: 理解DL模型学习内容对于AI在临床环境中的安全部署至关重要，现有研究多关注基于像素的可解释性方法，而对文本概念学习的关注较少，而文本概念更能反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺X光片特定的视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐度。

Result: 在乳腺X光片数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，且与放射科医生工作流程更一致；针对特定任务的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺X光片特定知识的见解，通过比较不同训练数据和微调策略的模型，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

Result: 在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有提升，在不同架构上均获得一致增益

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV框架能产生更一致和稳定的推理轨迹，具有广泛的适用性

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Method: 利用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动映射图，结合提取的语义物体先验，将相机和物体运动转换为像素运动，然后通过图像到视频网络生成视频。

Result: 大量实验验证表明，该方法在性能上大幅优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效生成遵循指定相机轨迹的视频，同时保持物体运动的一致性，在相机和物体运动整合方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探索判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：简单数据集和高度复杂数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度数据集为检测创造了最有利条件，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测具有非线性影响，中等复杂度数据集是判别器最有利的工作环境。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型校准和OOD检测等可靠性指标，挑战了效率与性能必须权衡的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在准确性之外的可靠性指标方面。

Method: 通过大规模评估量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅关注分布内准确性，还评估了包括校准和OOD检测在内的全面可靠性指标，并探索了量化感知训练方法。

Result: 量化能持续改善预训练模型的校准，即使在校准退化的情况下，OOD检测仍可能提升。特定QAT方法能同时提升零样本准确性、校准和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化在部署高效、可靠、鲁棒的视觉语言模型中具有超越传统效率角色的重要作用，为多目标优化问题提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例和200万个唯一表格，其中88%保留原始可视化效果，旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有VTU数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 引入TABLET数据集，包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息，基于200万个唯一表格构建，其中88%保留原始可视化。使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型在TABLET上进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化效果并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: CARINOX是一个统一的框架，结合噪声优化和探索，通过基于人类判断相关性的奖励选择程序，提高文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在描述复杂对象关系、属性或空间排列时往往无法实现组合对齐。现有的推理时方法各有局限性：优化可能因初始化不良而停滞，探索可能需要大量样本。单一奖励指标或临时组合无法可靠捕捉组合性的所有方面。

Method: CARINOX框架结合了噪声优化和探索，采用基于与人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序。该方法在互补基准测试上进行了评估。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench++上平均对齐分数提高了16%，在HRS基准上提高了11%，在所有主要类别上一致优于最先进的优化和探索方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一的优化-探索框架和原则性奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Motivation: 现有的特征归因方法在解释图像预测时，其稳健性和忠实性存在不足，无法可靠地反映底层黑盒模型的推理过程。

Method: 提出了四种共形函数来量化解释与模型预测的一致性，通过识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。

Result: 在六个图像数据集上使用五种解释器进行实证评估，结果显示FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率（通过解释区域大小衡量）方面均优于竞争方法，且基于超像素的共形度量比像素级度量更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度机制，能够生成更可靠和高效的特征归因解释，特别是在使用超像素作为共形度量时表现更佳。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合机制、分层对齐学习和统一预训练策略，解决了语义接地不足、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡以及跨模态学习效率低的问题，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个主要限制：1）语义接地不足，模型难以将骨架运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层级上最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译等多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了语义信息预训练的有效性和骨架数据作为独立解决方案的潜力。

Conclusion: Sigma展示了语义信息预训练的重要性，验证了骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的有效性，为跨模态学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术快速发展，但评估生成结果是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍然是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往是基于惯例或流行度采用，而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性，超越了简单的相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示：1）没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致；2）VQA-based指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；3）某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强；4）仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明的指标选择，这对领域的发展至关重要。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出了SlideMamba框架，将Mamba架构与图神经网络结合用于全切片图像分析，通过熵置信度加权机制自适应融合局部和全局信息，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 结合Mamba模块（擅长捕捉长距离全局依赖）和GNN（强调细粒度短程空间交互），引入基于熵置信度加权的自适应融合策略，动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务上，SlideMamba的PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合自适应融合策略在计算病理学的空间解析预测建模任务中显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个样本选择一种控制模态，偏重困难信号（如骨骼姿态）而降低简单信号（如点云）的权重。

Result: 实验表明额外控制信号提高了生成准确性，支持几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流程的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过统一的多模态控制框架显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable

Conclusion: 该方法通过图像感知的子问题生成机制有效提升了多步推理的准确性

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对T2I模型的评估主要关注对齐性（检查提示中指定元素是否出现），但忽略了模型超出提示生成的内容。需要明确定义T2I中的幻觉现象。

Method: 将T2I幻觉定义为基于偏见的偏差，并提出包含属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉的三类分类法，为评估建立上限并揭示隐藏偏见。

Result: 建立了一个系统的T2I幻觉评估框架，能够更全面地评估T2I模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为T2I模型提供了更丰富的评估基础，有助于识别和减少模型中的偏见驱动幻觉。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过分布鲁棒优化有效解决了微动作识别中的个体差异问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

### [80] [Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21263)
*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，通过保留VGGT的早期特征、微调后期特征并添加语义头，结合循环一致性训练策略和合成数据增强，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构）和最近邻规则（像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 保留VGGT的早期特征阶段，微调后期特征，添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方法（包含混叠伪影缓解）来适应语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，优于之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将3D几何基础模型VGGT适应于语义匹配任务，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的几何感知和匹配性能。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MedVSR框架，专门针对医学视频超分辨率任务，解决现有VSR模型在医学视频中存在的对齐困难、伪影和特征失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但受硬件限制和生理约束难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧间突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差大、对齐困难，且容易产生伪影和失真特征误导医生诊断。

Method: 提出MedVSR框架：1）Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP)模块，将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型中的控制矩阵，选择性传播一致且信息丰富的特征以实现有效对齐；2）Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR)模块，通过联合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在包括内窥镜和白内障手术在内的四种医学场景数据集上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR是针对医学视频超分辨率任务的定制化解决方案，能够有效解决医学视频特有的挑战，为临床诊断提供更高质量的图像支持。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来解决强化学习微调中的梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模长链思维数据集和开源多模态推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两个主要限制：缺乏高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的数据集；开源多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了精心策划数据和VAS方法的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度幅度，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据选择策略和高质量数据资源的发布，有效解决了多模态推理模型训练中的稳定性问题，为社区提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，而AI基础模型在大量无标记数据上预训练后，能够显著改变海洋科学中的AI应用。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练，然后通过微调应用于叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估计两个下游任务。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现出色，同时与点观测数据匹配良好，证明了自训练基础模型在海洋监测中的实用性。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像合成，通过利用预训练的扩散模型来解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的图像合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时存在困难，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入了流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练的自定义适配器（如IP-Adapter）来指导潜在表示，实现忠实的主体表示同时保持背景完整性。还提出了退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench上的实验显示，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够处理复杂光照条件下的高质量图像合成，并引入了新的基准测试集ComplexCompo来评估性能。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 本文提出了QuantVGGT，首个针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样性采样技术，解决了十亿级VGGT模型量化中的重尾分布和多视图数据稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）计算和内存成本过高，阻碍实际部署。后训练量化（PTQ）在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临数据无关特殊令牌导致的重尾激活分布和多视图数据校准样本选择不稳定的独特障碍。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样性采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样性校准簇确保量化范围稳定性。

Result: QuantVGGT在不同基准和比特宽度下达到最先进结果，4位量化可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持重建精度在完整精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有显著优势和实用性，证明了该框架在压缩大型3D重建Transformer模型方面的有效性。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Method: 提出牛顿生成框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程

Result: 通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导，牛顿生成能够实现物理一致的视频合成，并具有精确的参数控制能力

Conclusion: 该框架解决了当前模型仅从外观学习运动分布而缺乏对底层动力学理解的局限性

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step

gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力。需要一种数据驱动的方法来优化外交事件的叙述框架。

Method: 首先训练语言模型预测公众对事件的反应，构建包含外交事件描述和公众讨论的数据集；其次基于传播理论和专家意见确定文本修改特征；开发反事实生成算法系统性地产生文本修改版本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率高达70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解，帮助优化外交事件叙述以培养更理想的公众情绪。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了所提框架在跨语言语音情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛使用，AI生成文本与人类文本的界限变得模糊，这引发了学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等紧迫问题，需要可靠的AI文本检测方法来维护人类真实性和数字通信信任。

Method: 使用250对来自广泛研究主题的摘要数据集，测试和比较了经典方法（基于词袋、词性标注和TF-IDF特征的逻辑回归）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT增强N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT加轻量级分类器、LSTM-based N-gram模型），并评估了这些模型的集成效果。

Result: DistilBERT实现了整体最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供了可靠、平衡的替代方案，而LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法表现较差。三个最佳模型的最大投票集成未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示优于模型多样性，本研究为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大、更丰富的数据集来跟上不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，用于探索大型语言模型中的概念表示，通过识别-解释-验证的流程帮助研究人员理解SAE特征与人类概念之间的对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然稀疏自编码器是提取LLM可解释特征的有前景技术，但SAE特征本身并不与人类可理解的概念对齐，使得解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。需要弥合SAE特征与人类概念之间的差距。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，使用户能够使用感兴趣的概念查询SAE，交互式探索概念到特征的对应关系，并通过模型行为验证来验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明了ConceptViz的有效性，结果表明ConceptViz通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz最终帮助研究人员构建更准确的LLM特征心智模型，代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能并减少输入文档数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回无关内容，导致模型产生幻觉。需要理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容（自我知识），以更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，设计基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上利用模型的自我知识来筛选有益于回答查询的检索文档

Result: 在多个问答基准上使用Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B进行评估，实验结果显示SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量

Conclusion: 验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，为RAG系统的优化提供了有效方法

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征对齐到词级获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层映射并直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上都优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM框架成功解决了情感文本转语音中的动态情感转换问题，为自然可信的人机交互提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题。作者旨在在模型层面提升LLM在对话推荐中的性能。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘RL训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于先前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理策略，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，该方法达到了理论上保证的信息覆盖率

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将token消耗和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大、通信频繁的问题。本文旨在设计一个更高效的协作框架来平衡推理质量和计算成本。

Method: 提出MARS框架，包含作者智能体生成初始方案、审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论、元审稿人整合反馈并指导修订的三阶段角色协作流程，避免审稿人之间的直接交互。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间均减少约50%，在不同大语言模型上均表现稳定。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过角色分工和减少不必要的交互，有效提升了多智能体协作的效率，为大语言模型的推理任务提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得了重大进展，但对于许多缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源的低资源语言（如粤语和吴语），进展仍然有限。这些语言虽然各有超过8000万使用者，但缺乏专门的翻译质量评估资源。

Method: 基于现有的平行语料库构建SiniticMTError数据集，通过母语者的严格标注流程，提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性三个维度的标注，并分析标注者间一致性、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重性的模式。

Result: 创建了一个包含英语到普通话、粤语和吴语机器翻译错误标注的数据集，为机器翻译社区提供了可用于微调具有错误检测能力模型的资源。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估的研究，有助于推动低资源语言的机器翻译发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training

In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity

utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

Motivation: 在多语言医疗环境中，由于低资源语言缺乏标注医疗数据以及不同人群之间的语言变异性，从临床文本进行自动疾病诊断仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制和疾病分类头；使用孪生对比学习模块进行跨语言语义对齐；采用翻译一致性模块和对比投影头强化语言不变表示学习；通过多任务学习和MAML元学习实现快速适应能力。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力，特别是在低资源语言环境下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入应用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理深度不足。需要一种能够根据输入复杂度自适应调整推理深度的架构。

Method: 提出深度专业化混合专家(DS-MoE)框架，包含针对不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等），通过学习的路由网络动态组装定制推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示：计算节省达16%，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理任务准确率提高2.8%，同时提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE通过深度专业化模块化处理，在提升大规模语言模型效率、推理质量和可解释性方面取得显著进展，是自适应神经架构的重要进步。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer将文本处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的层次结构，导致二次计算成本、弱组合泛化和不足的语篇级建模

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer(HRT)，构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的上下文化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减降低复杂度

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena等基准测试中，HRT平均优于标准Transformer基线3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发的处理既能获得理论效率增益，又能实际提升语言理解能力

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成效率低，扩散语言模型需要大量迭代步骤，两者都存在效率问题。需要一种既能保持质量又能大幅提升采样速度的方法。

Method: 采用离散流匹配技术，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹中提取的强教师指导，实现稳定准确的少步采样。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步骤就达到了1024步离散流基线的困惑度水平，采样速度提升128倍，显著改善了延迟和吞吐量。

Conclusion: FS-DFM证明了通过显式建模步数参数和一致性训练，可以在保持生成质量的同时大幅提升语言生成效率，为高效语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

### [106] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法来解决日语语音识别中音素标注数据稀缺的问题，通过多任务学习和融合估计器，显著降低了音素识别错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，这限制了针对日语口语评估任务的语音识别器开发。

Method: 1. 多任务训练方案：引入辅助损失函数来估计输入信号的文本标签和音高模式，从而可以利用只有文本标注的语料进行训练。2. 融合两个估计器：一个基于音素字母串，另一个基于文本标记序列，使用基于有限状态转换器的算法进行融合。

Result: 提出的方法将核心评估集上的音素标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和融合方法对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，这些方法显著提升了日语口语评估任务中的语音识别性能。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测（MPP）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GNN和自监督学习在MPP方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs存在知识差距和幻觉问题，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码进行分子向量化，产生基于知识的特征，然后与结构表示融合。使用了GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLM进行知识提取。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与结构特征的集成显著提升了分子性质预测的性能，为解决LLMs的知识局限性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

### [108] [RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20691)
*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RedHerring的新型攻击方法，旨在使文本攻击检测模型不可靠，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而在分类器和检测器之间制造紧张关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别对抗性文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分探索。攻击者可能通过使检测模型误报来破坏其可信度。

Method: RedHerring攻击通过修改文本，使检测模型预测为攻击（误报），同时保持分类器的正确分类。在4个数据集上对3种检测器和4种分类器进行了测试。

Result: RedHerring能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出的简单置信度检查防御方法无需重新训练即可大幅提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型揭示了攻击者可能如何针对检测模型，为文本安全防御提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗性文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect技术与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于多长文本，提供另一种结合广义Binary和GreedySelect的方法。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均减少攻击所需查询次数达25.82%，同时不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新攻击选择策略有效解决了对抗性文本攻击中的计算效率问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的攻击测试解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MI-Fuse框架，通过去噪标签融合方法，在仅使用未标记目标域音频和API访问的LALM情况下，使学生模型在目标域超越LALM性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实部署中语音情感识别在域不匹配情况下的性能下降问题，特别是在源数据不可用且只能通过API访问大型音频语言模型时

Method: MI-Fuse去噪标签融合框架，使用源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，通过互信息不确定性加权多个随机预测，并采用指数移动平均教师稳定训练

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域迁移实验中显示一致性能提升，学生模型超越LALM并在最强基线基础上提升3.9%

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实可行的适应

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督神经语法归纳模型面临表达能力瓶颈，通常产生过大但性能不佳的语法。研究发现概率分布崩溃是导致这一限制的根本原因。

Method: 分析了概率分布崩溃在神经参数化关键组件中的出现时机和机制，并引入了崩溃松弛神经参数化作为针对性解决方案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了解析性能，同时允许在多种语言中使用更紧凑的语法，通过广泛的实证分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 崩溃松弛神经参数化是解决无监督语法归纳中概率分布崩溃问题的有效方法，能够实现更高效和准确的语法结构学习。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C2R是一个无需训练的框架，通过构建和优化子问题及其答案来提升问答任务的置信度评分，适用于文本、图像和视频领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答模型在复杂推理任务中置信度评估不够可靠，需要一种能够系统性地利用子问题来提升答案可靠性的方法。

Method: 首先构建子问题及其答案的集合，探索多样化的推理路径，然后通过比较候选答案的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。

Result: C2R能够无缝集成到各种现有问答模型中，在不同模型和基准测试中均表现出稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题数量和质量对模型推理鲁棒性的影响。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了监督微调(SFT)对LLM通用能力的负面影响，发现使用较小的学习率可以显著缓解性能下降，并提出新的Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，在保持目标领域性能的同时更好地平衡通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者希望通过实证和理论分析重新评估这种权衡，并寻找更优的平衡策略。

Method: 首先通过实验验证小学习率的效果，然后提出理论分析并基于此开发TALR方法。同时比较了L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等多种策略。

Result: 实验表明小学习率能显著缓解性能下降，而TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出了实用指南：使用小学习率实现有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了原子理论，将大语言模型内部表示的基本单元定义为原子，通过原子内积校正表示偏移，证明了原子满足受限等距性质，并验证了单层稀疏自编码器可以可靠识别原子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的内部表示基本单元未明确定义，神经元存在多义性问题，特征面临重建不可靠和不稳定的问题，需要找到更可靠的表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本表示单元，引入原子内积校正表示偏移，证明原子满足RIP条件，训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2和Llama3.1模型上验证理论。

Result: 在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B上实现了平均99.9%的稀疏重建，超过99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件，相比神经元(0.5%)和特征(68.2%)更可靠地捕获LLM的内在表示。

Conclusion: 原子理论为大语言模型内部表示提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础，证明了原子比神经元和特征更能忠实捕获LLM的内在表示。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [115] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出对话式提示方法，将用户评论重新表述为多轮对话，解决少样本和无训练情况下的个性化评论生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和无训练的情况，现有方法假设目标用户有大量评论历史或需要额外模型训练，而LLMs的有效性依赖于提示工程。

Method: 提出简单对话式提示(SCP)和对比对话式提示(CCP)两种变体，SCP仅使用用户自身评论，CCP插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并要求模型纠正，以鼓励模型生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使每个用户只有2条评论。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和无训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型任务中存在幻觉和事实错误问题，主要原因是结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间存在语义鸿沟，现有方法忽视了这一差距。

Method: 提出灵活的Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，实现高效的证据提取和精确推理，同时保证低计算成本和可扩展性。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量知识图谱并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架通过弥合语义鸿沟，显著提升了KGQA任务的性能，同时具有良好的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在监督微调后具有高可靠性但召回率低，而大语言模型倾向于过度修正导致精度低。需要结合两者的优势来提升语法错误修正的整体性能。

Method: PoCO方法分两步：首先使用大语言模型进行过度修正以最大化召回率，然后使用微调的小模型进行针对性后修正来识别和优化错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO能有效平衡语法错误修正性能，在保持竞争力的精度同时显著提高召回率。

Conclusion: PoCO通过结合大语言模型的生成能力和小监督模型的可靠性，成功提升了语法错误修正的整体质量。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的多示例上下文学习虽然有效但计算成本高，需要处理大量输入token

Method: 将多示例ICL的信息蒸馏为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文

Result: 在复杂推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL用更少的token达到与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索就能匹配基于检索的ICL

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLM进行下游任务的实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性。

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型逐步重写隐私敏感片段，动态探索重写空间。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型应用中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在不牺牲文本质量的前提下保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Method: 首先开发子句级别引用的标注指南并构建相应数据集；然后提出一个引用生成框架，利用LLM自动生成微调数据，并采用信用模型过滤低质量示例。

Result: 在构建的数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法能够生成高质量且更易读的引用。

Conclusion: 生成既简洁又充分的子句级别引用，可以减少用户确认生成输出正确性所需的工作量。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [121] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT是一种基于熵加权的监督微调方法，用于解决扩散语言模型在生成过程中缺乏精确概率估计的问题，通过在推理基准测试上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏每个去噪步骤的精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致，需要控制关键标记来引导生成方向。

Method: 提出WeFT方法，基于扩散理论为标记分配不同的权重，权重根据标记的熵值确定，实现对扩散语言模型的加权监督微调。

Result: 在open-r1数据集的s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，WeFT在四个推理基准测试（Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500）上分别比标准SFT相对提升了39%、64%和83%。

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型在监督微调中的挑战，显著提升了推理任务的性能，代码和模型将公开可用。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究如何让医学推理模型生成排名答案列表，提出提示和微调两种方法，发现强化微调比监督微调在不同答案格式上更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型在开放性问题中仍只生成单一答案，这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 研究提示和微调两种方法：监督微调模仿标注响应，强化微调通过奖励函数激励探索；提出针对排名列表的新奖励函数。

Result: 监督微调模型在某些答案格式上表现良好，但强化微调模型在多种格式上更稳健；模型可能无法选择基准的首选答案，但能识别有效答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代格式提供了第一步。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ是一个新颖的对抗性多智能体框架，通过总结和测验两个互补领域的专业智能体协作，解决长文档摘要中的信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在长文档摘要任务中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性差的问题，需要新的方法来解决这些限制。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含总结生成器、总结评审器、测验生成器、测验评审器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一种利用对抗性智能体协作来改进摘要质量的新方法，为长文档摘要任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

TL;DR: 提出了MemLens方法，通过分析数字令牌在生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测LLM的记忆化现象，发现受污染样本在模型早期层就锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中逐渐积累证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法主要依赖表层词汇重叠和困惑度，泛化能力差，在处理隐式污染数据时性能显著下降。

Method: 使用激活透镜分析数字令牌的概率轨迹，通过LoRA微调注入精心设计的样本来验证轨迹模式。

Result: 受污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，MemLens能够捕捉到真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关。

Conclusion: MemLens方法有效解决了LLM评估中的记忆化检测问题，为模型污染检测提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [125] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语大语言模型的工具调用能力，探讨了是否需要阿拉伯语专用数据、通用指令调优的影响以及特定工具微调的价值，并通过实验提供了开发阿拉伯语工具增强代理的最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，对于阿拉伯语等其他语言的研究存在空白。本文旨在填补这一资源缺口，探索如何为阿拉伯语等非英语语言开发有效的工具调用功能。

Method: 通过将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语，使用基础和训练后的阿拉伯语LLM变体进行广泛实验，研究三个关键问题：阿拉伯语专用数据的必要性、通用指令调优的影响、特定工具微调的价值。

Result: 实验结果为开发稳健的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解，揭示了不同策略对工具调用性能的影响。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了阿拉伯语工具调用研究的空白，为开发多语言工具调用能力提供了重要指导，特别是在资源有限的语言环境中。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM驱动的自动评估系统在学术文本输入问题评分中的应用潜力，特别是在教育领域中作为辅助工具。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估，使用三个模型在110个计算机科学学生答案数据集上进行测试并与人工评估结果对比。

Result: 结果显示参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214），能提供公平评分和完整评估。

Conclusion: AI驱动的自动评估系统在采用适当方法时有潜力作为学术资源的补充工具，参考辅助评估是最有效的自动评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Motivation: FFRDCs面临大量文本工作负载（政策文件、科技论文等），手动分析速度缓慢，需要自动化解决方案来提升分析效率。

Method: 使用OnPrem.LLM开源框架，仅需少量输入输出示例即可实现文本分析功能，确保在敏感政府环境中的安全性和数据主权。

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 因果掩码在Transformer解码器中也能提供位置信息，即使没有参数或输入中的因果依赖关系。研究发现因果掩码会诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，倾向于关注附近的查询-键对，并且与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RoPE等显式位置编码是Transformer解码器中位置信息的主要来源，但因果掩码也能提供位置信息。本研究旨在证明因果掩码如何诱导位置依赖的注意力模式。

Method: 通过理论分析证明因果掩码会诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并通过实证分析验证训练模型中的这种行为。特别研究了因果掩码与RoPE的交互作用。

Result: 理论分析表明因果掩码诱导的注意力模式倾向于关注附近的查询-键对。实证分析证实训练模型表现出相同行为，学习参数进一步放大这些模式。因果掩码与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力模式为非相对模式。

Conclusion: 在现代大语言模型中一致观察到这种效应，表明需要将因果掩码视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息来源。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在现实场景中的应用增加，理解它们同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要，但评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行。

Method: 创建了两个专门基准：ManyIFEval（最多10个指令的文本生成）和StyleMBPP（最多6个指令的代码生成），并在10个LLM上进行实验，开发了三种回归模型来预测性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，所有模型的性能都一致下降；逻辑回归模型使用指令数量作为解释变量，能够以约10%的误差预测未见指令组合的性能。

Conclusion: 相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）足以进行性能估计，使得在各种指令组合下高效评估LLM成为可能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

TL;DR: SoM-1K是首个大规模多模态基准数据集，专门用于评估基础模型在材料力学问题上的表现。研究发现当前基础模型在复杂工程问题上表现不佳，最佳模型准确率仅56.6%，且发现提供图像文本描述(DoI)的LLM通常优于直接处理图像的VLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多个领域展现出卓越能力，但在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未得到充分探索。研究旨在填补这一空白，建立工程AI的严格基准。

Method: 构建包含1,065个标注材料力学问题的SoM-1K数据集，包含文本问题陈述和示意图。提出DoI提示策略，提供专家生成的图像文本描述。评估8个代表性基础模型（LLM和VLM）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率56.6%。LLM配合DoI通常优于VLM直接处理图像。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 本研究为工程AI建立了严格基准，凸显了开发更强大多模态推理能力的迫切需求，特别是在科学和工程背景下，文本描述可能比直接图像输入更有效。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM在生成应用中存在微妙的文化公平性问题，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对非主流文化表现出明显的外部性，需要系统识别和缓解这种文化定位偏见。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。提出两种推理时缓解方法：基于提示的公平干预支柱（FIP）和基于代理的缓解框架（MFA），包括单代理（MFA-SA）和多代理（MFA-MA）两种管道。

Result: 对5个最先进LLM的实证评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中88%以上采用内部视角，但对较少主导文化主要采用外部立场。基于代理的方法被证明是缓解生成LLM偏见的有前景方向。

Conclusion: LLM存在显著的文化定位偏见，需要专门的方法来缓解。基于代理的框架（特别是多代理方法）能有效减轻这种偏见，为生成LLM的公平性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE是一个用于评估搜索增强大语言模型个性化能力的基准测试，通过收集真实的人类聊天和搜索历史，结合细粒度偏好评分和反馈，系统性地分析个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然通过检索生成减轻了用户认知负担，但无法充分满足不同用户的多样化需求，特别是在识别同一查询背后不同意图和提供个性化信息方面存在不足。

Method: 通过长期深度的人类标注构建BESPOKE基准，收集真实用户的聊天和搜索历史，让标注者基于自身历史编写查询需求，并对响应进行评分和诊断反馈。

Result: BESPOKE基准能够系统性地揭示信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLMs的细粒度评估提供基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE基准填补了搜索增强LLMs个性化评估的系统性空白，通过真实的人类数据和诊断性反馈，为个性化信息服务的进一步发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [135] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个语音版本的BBQ基准测试，用于评估口语语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，口语语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容层面和声学层面，需要专门的评估工具来同时诊断这两种偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控的语音条件，通过计算每个维度的准确率、偏见和一致性分数来评估模型。

Result: 评估了两个SLM模型：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，可以联合诊断口语语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于分析语音语言模型中基于声学的性别差异的新数据集，发现LLaMA-Omni系列模型在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向的偏见，而在需要性别区分的语境中却表现出性别无关的回应，这种矛盾模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音感知语言模型虽然改变了人机交互方式，但可能存在基于声学的性别差异问题，即相同问题因说话者性别不同而得到不同回应，需要系统性地分析这一现象。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的新数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类问题，评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，并通过与对应骨干LLM的比较分析偏见来源。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题中所有模型都表现出男性导向回应；在需要性别区分的语境中却表现出性别无关回应；这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，虽然优先考虑一般公平原则但忽视了语境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来在语音技术中正确利用性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ROC框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，通过整合实体类型和位置信息、使用大语言模型扩展关系标签为自然语言描述，以及基于语义相似度的对比学习来对齐实体-关系对，在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个显著局限性：(1) 忽略了实体类型和位置线索等结构约束；(2) 缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架包含三个关键组件：1）通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息；2）使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述；3）通过基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，ROC在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过将多模态关系抽取重新定义为检索任务，有效克服了传统分类方法的局限性，为细粒度关系理解提供了更语义化的解决方案。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现LLM训练数据中存在语法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性会干扰模型对指令语义的理解，甚至可能被用来绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要理解任务指令的语义和领域，但语法也可能传递隐含信息。研究发现训练数据中语法模板与领域存在虚假相关性，可能影响模型性能和安全。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析语法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型的影响，建立评估框架检测FlanV2数据集中的现象，并进行安全微调案例研究。

Result: 语法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（均值0.51±0.06），在OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick和GPT-4o中都存在这种现象，且可能被用于绕过拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要显式测试语法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中特别是领域内的语法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一，可用于评估大语言模型的常识知识和推理能力。

Method: 通过文献综述方法，系统梳理计算幽默领域的研究进展，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进模型仍无法达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并就该领域未来研究方向进行了广泛讨论，特别考虑了幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在某些领域表现出与大型语言模型相当的性能，但训练和推理能耗更低。然而，SLM在下游任务中的PII泄露问题尚未被充分探索。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出GEP方法（基于贪婪坐标梯度的PII提取方法），在模板式和自由式插入场景下进行实验。

Result: GEP方法相比传统模板方法泄露量提升60倍，在自由式插入的复杂场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: SLM存在严重的PII泄露风险，需要开发更有效的检测和保护方法，GEP方法为PII泄露检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在科学推理中的两个关键瓶颈：显式检索会中断推理过程并增加额外开销，多智能体管道会稀释强解决方案。

Method: 基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼(HSR)和质量感知迭代推理(QAIR)进行结构化协作。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam生物/化学数据集上达到48.3%的准确率，比最强基线提升13.4个百分点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效问题，在检索任务中受益于解决方案多样性，在推理任务中偏好共识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CLaw基准，专门用于评估LLMs在中国法律知识及其推理应用方面的能力，发现当前LLMs在法律条款准确检索和引用方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律文本分析和法规引用任务中的可靠性受到通用预训练的限制，需要专门的法律知识评估基准。

Method: 构建包含306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库（64,849条目）和254个基于案例的推理实例，对当代LLMs进行实证评估。

Result: 大多数当代LLMs在忠实再现法律条款方面表现显著不足，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确知识检索（通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大通用推理能力的协同作用，本文为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法在组织跨不同粒度对话和生成记忆的相关信息方面存在困难，需要更有效的记忆管理方法来处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长对话历史。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索到的原始对话与生成的记忆（如摘要、事实和见解）为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高了准确性，并在长对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长对话记忆，为LLM提供更好的上下文支持，在长对话问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图带来高token成本且丢失上下文，粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建查询中心图，实现可控粒度的索引和多跳块检索机制。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确率上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词在扩散模型中会导致含义混淆和重复生成的问题，特别是由于Anglocentric偏见的存在，非英语词汇在翻译成英语后也可能变成同音异义词，从而影响生成质量。

Method: 提出了一种测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型进行自动评估和人工评估，并研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 评估了不同扩散模型的性能，发现提示扩展方法能有效减少同音异义词重复问题，包括由Anglocentric偏见引起的重复。

Conclusion: 同音异义词重复是扩散模型的一个重要问题，提示扩展是一种有效的缓解方法，自动评估管道代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI文本检测数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要为英语、缺乏混合人机写作场景、缺少字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语（英语和俄语）语料库，提供字符级标注支持两个关键任务：全文二元分类和AI生成区间检测

Result: 开发了LLMTrace数据集，该数据集支持训练和评估更细致实用的AI检测模型

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对思维链（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明该上界与CoT推理步数正相关，且无限长的推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明思维链（CoT）输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏对这些扰动如何影响CoT输出的理论解释，这限制了我们对扰动在推理过程中传播机制的深入理解，也阻碍了提示优化方法的进一步改进。

Method: 首先推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，然后应用这些结论到线性自注意力（LSA）模型（Transformer的简化版本），证明输入扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果一致，经验性地证明了研究发现的正确性。具体发现包括：输入扰动上界与CoT推理步数正相关；无限长的推理过程无法消除输入扰动影响；在LSA模型中，输入扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。

Conclusion: 本文填补了输入扰动对CoT输出影响的理论研究空白，为理解扰动在推理过程中的传播机制提供了理论依据，对改进提示优化方法具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种多模态编码器，通过结合冻结的CLIP视觉转换器和新型张量网络文本编码器，显式编码句法结构，显著提升视觉语言任务的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在大规模图像文本对齐方面表现优异，但往往忽略语言组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，其收缩反映句子的语法推导。通过张量分解保持模型高效性，参数量从数千万减少到不足一百万。采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 显著提升对动词语义和词序的敏感性：将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系分数分别提升超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Updesh，一个针对13种印度语言的大规模合成指令数据集，通过自下而上的生成策略，利用大型开源LLM基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成文化情境化数据，以解决多语言AI系统在低资源环境中的有效性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在多语言环境中有效运作且保持文化根基的AI系统是一个长期挑战，特别是在低资源设置中。合成数据提供了一个有前景的途径，但其在多语言和多文化背景下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，提示大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容进行数据生成，创建文化情境化的合成数据集。这种方法补充了从高资源语言（如英语）翻译合成数据集的主流自上而下范式。

Result: 生成的Updesh数据集包含950万数据点，涵盖13种印度语言，包含多样化的推理和生成任务。评估显示生成数据质量高，但人工评估指出了进一步改进的空间。在下游评估中，使用Updesh微调的模型在生成任务上取得显著提升，在多选式NLU任务上保持竞争力，特别是在低和中资源语言中改进最明显。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了经验证据，表明有效的多语言AI需要结合情境感知、文化根基方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型中的奉承行为可分为奉承性同意和奉承性赞美，这两种行为与真诚同意在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码，可以独立调控而不相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出奉承行为（如过度同意或讨好用户），但尚不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何分析，在多个模型和数据集上对比奉承性同意、奉承性赞美和真诚同意三种行为。

Result: 三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同的线性方向编码；每种行为可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为；这种表征结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 奉承行为对应着不同的、可独立调控的表征，表明它们具有独立的神经机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Motivation: RLHF依赖缺乏明确标准的人类判断，存在可解释性差和奖励黑客问题；RLVR局限于基于正确性的验证器。需要结合两者的优势，捕捉超越正确性的响应质量细微方面。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元回答的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应是否满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上达到81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排行榜第一）。使用RLBFF对齐的Qwen3-32B在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2等基准测试中匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能，推理成本不到5%。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了结合人类偏好灵活性和规则验证精确性的有效方法，实现了可定制化的奖励模型训练，并提供了完全开源的实现方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

TL;DR: SeHDR是一种新颖的高动态范围3D高斯泼溅方法，能够从单曝光的多视角LDR图像生成HDR新视角，无需传统方法所需的多曝光图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR-3DGS方法需要从不同曝光的多视角图像中学习，这种数据采集过程繁琐且容易受到物体运动模糊和校准误差的影响。SeHDR旨在解决从单曝光LDR图像学习HDR场景表示的病态问题。

Method: 首先从单曝光LDR输入学习基础3D高斯，然后估计具有相同几何但不同线性颜色的多个3D高斯（条件于曝光操作），最后通过可微分神经曝光融合将基础和估计的3D高斯整合为HDR高斯进行新视角渲染。

Result: 大量实验表明，SeHDR在性能上优于现有方法以及精心设计的基线方法。

Conclusion: SeHDR成功实现了从单曝光多视角LDR图像学习HDR场景表示，为解决传统多曝光方法的数据采集难题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting
(HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images.
Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images
to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more
likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and
calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene
representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight
to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians
(i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we
may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene
representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from
single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors
in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical
geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations.
Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to
integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view
rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeHDR outperforms existing
methods as well as carefully designed baselines.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,

challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver标志着向通用3D环境生成迈出了重要一步，通过统一的工具化框架解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

TL;DR: ArtUV是一个全自动的端到端方法，用于生成艺术家风格的UV展开，通过两阶段模拟专业UV映射过程：表面接缝预测和艺术家风格UV参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法存在耗时、碎片化、缺乏语义性和不规则UV岛等问题，限制了实际应用。艺术家风格的UV图需要满足无重叠映射、最小失真等基本标准，以及清晰边界、高效空间利用和语义一致性等高级标准。

Method: 使用SeamGPT生成语义切割接缝，然后通过基于优化的方法获得粗糙UV，再输入到自动编码器中精炼成艺术家风格的UV图。

Result: ArtUV在多个基准测试中表现出色，确保语义一致性和拓扑结构保持，使UV图可直接用于2D编辑。

Conclusion: ArtUV可作为专业渲染工具的插件或独立系统，为快速、高质量的UV生成提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Method: 使用双分支点云编码器分离捕获拓扑和几何特征，预训练后通过直接偏好优化(DPO)在基于接缝评估框架的偏好数据集上进行微调

Conclusion: SeamCrafter通过创新的自回归生成架构和偏好优化框架，有效解决了3D网格接缝生成中的关键挑战

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Method: 将网格简化算法视为从细到粗的过程，通过推广网格到单纯复形，开发基于transformer的自回归模型来近似简化过程的逆过程。从单点开始，通过局部重网格化逐步添加几何细节，拓扑结构不预定义且可改变。

Result: 实验表明该渐进式网格生成方法不仅可以通过提前停止自回归过程来直观控制生成质量和时间消耗，还支持网格细化和编辑等应用。

Conclusion: 提出的渐进式自回归网格生成方法比传统方法更有效地捕捉几何结构，提供了更好的控制性和应用灵活性。

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ArchGPT，一个多模态建筑视觉问答模型，以及一个可扩展的数据构建管道Arch-300K，用于解决现有VR/MR/AR系统在建筑探索中存在的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VR/MR/AR系统通常针对特定案例开发，依赖硬编码注释和任务特定交互，无法在不同建筑环境中扩展使用。

Method: 通过多阶段流程构建Arch-300K数据集：从Wikimedia Commons收集建筑场景，使用粗到细策略筛选图像；提出LLM引导的文本验证和知识蒸馏管道生成可靠问答对；在ShareGPT4V-7B上进行监督微调得到ArchGPT。

Result: 构建了包含约315,000个图像-问题-答案三元组的Arch-300K数据集，并成功训练出ArchGPT模型。

Conclusion: ArchGPT和Arch-300K为建筑领域的沉浸式探索提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够增强建筑在教育、遗产保护和专业设计实践中的可访问性和理解。

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从神经隐式函数中解析提取表面的新方法，避免了传统方法因空间离散化导致的精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式和隐式3D表示各有优势，需要高效转换。传统表面提取方法（如Marching Cubes）依赖空间分解和采样，受限于固定分辨率导致精度不足。

Method: 利用每个神经元划分域的特性，开发深度优先遍历策略来高效跟踪编码表面，无需临时空间离散化，支持并行处理和大规模神经架构。

Result: 生成的网格准确捕获网络中的完整几何信息，在不同形状和网络架构上达到前所未有的精度，同时保持竞争性速度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经隐式函数的表面提取提供了高精度解决方案，克服了传统离散化方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CHARM提出了一种新的参数化表示和生成框架，专门用于动漫发型建模。该方法通过控制点序列表示每个发片，使用仅五个几何参数编码，支持艺术家友好设计和基于学习的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统发型建模方法主要关注真实头发，使用基于发丝或体积的表示，而动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构的几何特征，现有技术难以处理。现有方法依赖密集网格建模或手工样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合可扩展学习。

Method: CHARM引入紧凑、可逆的控制点参数化表示，每个发片用控制点序列表示，每个点仅用五个几何参数编码。基于此表示，构建自回归生成框架，将动漫发型解释为序列化的"发型语言"，使用自回归transformer捕捉局部几何和全局发型拓扑。

Result: 构建了AnimeHair大规模数据集，包含37K高质量动漫发型。实验表明CHARM在重建精度和生成质量方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了表达能力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持高效编辑和高质量生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包括集中式流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本四种算法，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的框架在性能上优于强化学习和MCMC方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets框架为多智能体协作生成提供了理论基础和有效算法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器需要N次顺序传递的方式，实现了无损失LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来提出N个token，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿过程中的顺序依赖性来加速LLM推理。

Method: FastEagle采用轻量级层级级联结构替代时间步骤，通过层级监督训练来减轻错误累积，并结合约束草稿树保持无损失验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下始终优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 去除草稿中的顺序依赖性是实现无损失LLM推理加速的实用路径，FastEagle证明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz），用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，解决了传统化学方案计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数参与耦合模式比较项目（CMIP）的气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏臭氧的交互式表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。

Method: 开发了基于机器学习的臭氧参数化方法（mloz），仅需大气温度廓线信息作为输入，能够在两个不同的气候模型（UKESM和ICON）中在线使用，并支持臭氧与准两年振荡的双向相互作用。

Result: mloz在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，比UKESM中的化学方案快约31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%，且能够跨模型迁移使用。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏交互式化学方案的CMIP级气候模型提供了广泛应用的潜力，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟时，臭氧趋势和变率对大气反馈过程有显著调节作用。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级EEG设备的普及，用户隐私保护需求日益迫切，需要在不影响EEG应用效用的前提下保护敏感数据

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，并在自动睡眠分期任务上评估重识别风险和效用保持情况

Result: EEG信号的重识别能力显著降低，同时机器学习任务的效用得到有效保留

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保护用户隐私的同时维持EEG数据的实用性，为EEG数据的安全使用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Motivation: 随着影响估计工具在数据估值和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要评估这些分数本身是否可能被恶意操纵，以确保其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种基于计算输入伪逆的实用攻击方法，该方法仅需黑盒访问模型输出，计算开销适中。通过图像分类任务的广泛实验验证攻击效果。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的影响估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵攻击的影响。理论分析揭示了影响估计在对抗性扰动下的固有脆弱性条件。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了基于影响的归因方法存在严重漏洞，强调了开发鲁棒防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离两种框架的方法，通过准度量表示空间结构和额外约束学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习方法中，对比表示框架和时序距离框架各有优势但存在局限性。对比表示方法在噪声高维环境中表现稳定但难以实现路径拼接，而准度量网络方法擅长路径拼接但在复杂环境中表现不佳。

Method: 结合准度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）与适当约束条件，学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。该方法利用准度量距离参数化来学习最优目标到达距离，即使使用次优数据和在随机环境中也能有效工作。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的路径拼接任务上表现优异，同时在准度量网络方法难以应对的噪声高维环境中也取得良好性能。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了对比表示方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及准度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一种结合领域特定规则的多模态聚类框架，通过将规则嵌入到变分自编码器的潜在空间中，实现更符合领域知识的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法有效捕捉领域特定的结构和语义约束，限制了在复杂领域中的应用效果。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过损失函数中的规则一致性和违反惩罚来强制约束合规性。规则由LLM生成并构建知识图谱。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐身飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，但面临LLM规则生成可能产生幻觉或冲突、规则过多导致过拟合、复杂领域扩展困难等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Motivation: 注意力层的参数依赖于输入元素的成对交互，导致内存和计算复杂度随序列长度呈二次方增长。现有方法通过引入稀疏性或递归依赖来缓解，但各有缺点。

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效逆运算，结合稀疏性和递归依赖的优势，提出新算法。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有望解决注意力层计算复杂度问题，结合了两种现有方法的优点。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved

*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出用复杂度奖励替代熵奖励，通过平衡随机性和结构化来改进策略梯度方法的探索策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化策略往往将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种探索策略缺乏结构且效率低下。作者希望找到一种更鲁棒的探索方式。

Method: 提出复杂度驱动策略优化（CDPO），使用香农熵和离平衡度的乘积作为复杂度度量，替代PPO中的熵奖励。

Result: 在多个离散动作空间任务上的实验表明，CDPO对复杂度系数的选择比PPO对熵系数的选择更鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够鼓励策略在随机性和结构化之间取得平衡，引导智能体发现有用且非平凡的行为，是一种比熵奖励更有效的探索策略。

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析基于确定性扩散模型的逆问题求解算法，证明了当数据分布集中在低维模型集上时，噪声卷积分数可以解释为时变投影，并推导了在受限等距性质下的定量收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恢复高维信号是逆问题的核心挑战。虽然生成扩散模型在提供数据驱动先验方面取得了显著经验成功，但严格的恢复保证仍然有限。

Method: 开发理论框架分析确定性扩散算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将先前算法视为广义投影梯度下降方法。在满足受限等距性质时推导收敛率。

Result: 当底层数据分布集中在低维模型集上时，可以建立定量收敛保证。在低秩高斯混合模型等非凸设置下也能建立全局收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于扩散模型的逆问题求解提供了理论基础，特别是在非凸模型集上也能保证全局收敛，扩展了扩散模型的理论应用范围。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

TL;DR: MDBench是一个开源基准测试框架，用于评估动态系统模型发现方法，评估了12种算法在14个偏微分方程和63个常微分方程上的表现，发现线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对动态模型发现的全面基准测试，现有研究多集中于单一方程的符号回归，需要系统评估模型发现方法的性能。

Method: 开发MDBench框架，在噪声条件下评估12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，评估指标包括导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度。

Result: 线性方法在PDE上表现最佳，遗传编程在ODE上表现最佳；线性模型对噪声更具鲁棒性；当前方法在处理流体动力学和热力学等复杂PDE系统时存在局限性。

Conclusion: MDBench为模型发现方法提供了严格、可扩展的基准测试框架，有助于系统评估和改进方程精度与鲁棒性，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经概率电路（NPC）的对抗鲁棒性，发现其仅依赖于属性识别模型的鲁棒性，并提出了一种新的鲁棒神经概率电路（RNPC）来抵御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPC模型虽然具有增强的可解释性和下游任务的高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模型仍然是黑盒，容易受到对抗攻击的影响，可能危及最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC方法，通过新颖的类级集成推理机制，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。理论分析证明RNPC相比NPC具有可证明的对抗鲁棒性提升。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实证结果表明，RNPC在保持良性输入高准确率的同时，相比现有概念瓶颈模型实现了更优的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RNPC是首个针对识别模块对抗攻击的鲁棒神经概率电路，通过理论分析和实证验证证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了两种混合机器学习分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的性能，并在外部验证集上评估其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林和SVM+逻辑回归。采用防泄漏的标准化流程（编码、插补、缩放；仅在训练折叠上使用SMOTE；SVM概率校准），在主数据集上训练并冻结流程，然后在PIMA外部队列上进行验证。

Result: 在主数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC ~0.995，AUPRC ~0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC ~0.978，AUPRC ~0.947）。在PIMA外部验证集上，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC ~0.990，AUPRC ~0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低（AUROC ~0.963，AUPRC ~0.875）。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，表现出更小的外部衰减和可接受的校准。结果支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健、可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出PIRF方法，将物理约束生成建模为稀疏奖励优化问题，通过轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度，避免DPS式价值函数近似误差，在五个PDE基准测试中实现高效采样下的优越物理约束执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域表现出强大生成能力，但常违反物理定律。现有方法依赖DPS式价值函数近似，存在显著误差和训练不稳定问题。

Method: PIRF方法：1）计算轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度；2）层截断反向传播利用物理奖励的时空局部性；3）基于权重的正则化方案提高效率。

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下持续实现优越的物理约束执行效果。

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有巨大潜力，PIRF为物理约束生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）的超参数进行了全局敏感性分析，揭示了超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和不确定性量化（UQ）的影响，并建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改进BNNs在实际应用中的超参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络虽然能提供预测不确定性量化，但在实际应用中由于训练近似方法和超参数选择困难，难以获得准确的不确定性量化。超参数数量多且影响不透明，需要系统分析其影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在不同超参数设置下评估BNNs的性能表现，分析超参数之间的相互作用对预测准确性和不确定性量化的影响。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数之间存在相互作用，共同影响预测准确性和不确定性量化效果。超参数的选择对BNNs性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来进行维度缩减和超参数选择，以确保BNNs能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一类新的稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于解决神经SDE求解器的内存效率和梯度精度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两种方法：离散化后优化（内存成本高）和优化后离散化（梯度近似误差大）。现有的代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但在复杂模型和大步长下往往不稳定。

Method: 引入了显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保留了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了其不稳定性，实现了内存高效的训练，且不受步长或模型复杂性的严重限制。

Result: 通过数值实验证明了所提出方案的优越稳定性和可靠性，表明这些方案为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: EES方案在保持内存效率的同时，提供了稳定的梯度计算，适用于复杂模型和大步长情况，为神经SDE的训练提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一种直接有效的互信息估计方法，通过自适应重要性采样实现了可扩展的估计，为复杂系统中的互信息测量提供了新工具。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架成功解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可扩展和可重用的分层策略提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题的新方法，通过GRPO策略优化和专家轨迹的密集可验证奖励，解决了LLM智能体在多轮任务规划中的训练挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM智能体进行复杂多轮任务规划面临稀疏奖励、长时程信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，利用专家轨迹提供密集可验证奖励进行策略优化。

Result: 1.5B参数的模型在单轮GRPO训练下，在超过30步的长时程规划任务中达到70%的成功率，性能优于14B参数的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了多轮任务的成功概率，还展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，训练在复杂任务上的模型能够成功完成所有更简单的子任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

TL;DR: PFedDL是一种新颖的联邦学习框架，用于解决多站点fMRI研究中的数据隐私和站点异质性挑战，通过分解站点特定字典为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，在ABIDE数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多站点功能磁共振成像研究中，数据隐私约束和站点特异性异质性导致非独立同分布数据，阻碍了通用模型的开发。

Method: 提出个性化联邦字典学习框架，在每个站点独立进行字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件，通过联邦聚合更新全局原子，独立优化本地原子以捕获站点特异性变异。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非独立同分布数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL框架能够在不共享原始数据的情况下实现跨站点协作建模，有效处理数据隐私和站点异质性挑战，提升下游分析性能。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

TL;DR: CERMIC是一个用于多智能体强化学习（MARL）的探索框架，通过观察同伴行为来校准内在好奇心，在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于现有算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有好奇心机制在MARL中存在问题：1）无法区分环境随机性和真正的新颖性；2）对所有意外观察采用统一的新颖性偏见；3）忽视了包含潜在任务动态的同伴行为新颖性，导致在去中心化、无通信的MARL设置中探索效果不佳。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴来校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架：1）鲁棒地过滤噪声惊喜信号；2）通过推断多智能体上下文动态校准内在好奇心；3）生成理论上有依据的内在奖励，鼓励探索具有高信息增益的状态转换。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，使用CERMIC进行探索在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于最先进的算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过有效利用同伴行为信息来校准内在好奇心，解决了MARL中探索的关键挑战，为多智能体系统的自主探索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

TL;DR: 开发基于机器学习的策略来预测大规模并行化学计算所需的资源成本，以指导用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵实验前的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算（如耦合簇方法）时面临的两个关键问题：最短时间配置（最小化执行时间）和最经济配置（最小化资源使用）。

Method: 评估多种机器学习模型和策略，基于CCSD应用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上的运行参数值集合。使用梯度提升模型和主动学习方法进行预测。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073。主动学习方法仅需约450个实验数据点即可达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现优异，主动学习在数据收集成本高的情况下具有实用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要建立理论框架来确保稳定性。

Method: 建立非渐近下界关联演示数量与ICL稳定性，提出基于协方差谱性质的两阶段可观测估计器，包含一次性校准。

Result: 实验显示预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小差距。

Conclusion: 研究将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合理论与部署之间的鸿沟，提高了现实有限样本场景下大规模提示的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport（双谱最优传输），这是一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，能够在保持信号结构的同时去除由群作用引起的变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征之间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统OT方法无法有效处理对称变换带来的干扰。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示保留了所有信号结构，同时仅去除由群作用引起的变异。

Result: 在经视觉对称变换的基准数据集上，双谱OT计算的传输计划比原始特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确率，改善了有意义的对应关系质量。

Conclusion: 双谱OT能够捕获数据集中底层语义标签结构的有意义对应关系，同时去除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异，优于传统最优传输方法。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现联邦学习在LLM微调中仍存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，并提出增强攻击策略和隐私保护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织间协作微调LLM具有吸引力，但数据共享存在隐私顾虑。联邦学习作为隐私保护框架被寄予厚望，但现有研究对其在LLM微调中的实际隐私保护效果缺乏验证。

Method: 通过大量实验验证联邦学习环境下LLM的数据泄露风险，包括使用简单生成方法和专门设计的增强攻击策略（跟踪全局模型更新），并评估差分隐私、正则化约束和安全对齐等隐私保护技术的效果。

Result: 实验表明攻击者仍能从全局模型中提取训练数据，泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。隐私保护技术能有效降低风险。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在LLM微调中并非完全隐私安全，需要结合差分隐私等保护措施。研究为FL训练LLM的隐私风险提供了重要见解和实践指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在训练过程中会裁剪低概率token的梯度信号，但这些被丢弃的token对调节策略熵的演化具有关键作用。需要一种新方法来保留这些有价值的梯度信息。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和且有界的方式重新引入被PPO裁剪的token梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度大小来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 理论分析和实验证据表明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中，不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了RL训练LLMs时的熵控制问题，为复杂推理任务的优化提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Conclusion: SynGA不仅是一个强大的独立基准，还是一个可集成到更大合成感知工作流程中的通用模块，因其轻量级和内置可合成性约束而具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了深度学习中的缩放定律本质上是冗余定律，通过核回归证明了数据协方差谱的多项式尾部会产生幂律风险，缩放指数取决于数据冗余度而非普适常数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律显示了模型性能随数据集和模型规模呈幂律增长，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直未被严格解释。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部对超额风险的影响，建立了缩放指数与数据冗余度的数学关系。

Result: 发现缩放指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部，1/β衡量冗余度，表明学习曲线的斜率不是普适的而是依赖于数据冗余。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其统一为有限样本冗余定律，连接了经验观察与理论基础。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

Motivation: 虽然反欺骗系统对保护语音应用安全至关重要，但广泛使用的音频水印（最初为版权保护设计）对反欺骗系统的影响尚未被探索。

Method: 构建Watermark-Spoofing数据集，应用手工和神经水印方法；提出知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架，使模型能适应水印引起的域偏移。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发水印弹性反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

TL;DR: 本研究对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行敏感性评估，分析超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响，比较了GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具在10种不同架构配置下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GANs和扩散模型，但计算成本较高，限制了其在普通硬件上的应用。需要研究如何在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求。

Method: 在两个工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从三个维度评估敏感性：运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布的相似性，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两种工具都能获得高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer配合轻量级LLMs提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限度。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

### [202] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效的自适应学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化框架，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上效率很高，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法无法有效解决这些重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似更新引起的数据分布变化，延迟完全重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提高高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的技术组合有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能问题，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合MLP和CNN的新方法，用于处理非平稳时间序列数据，通过MLP捕捉长期趋势依赖，CNN处理局部变化模式，并设计了IConv架构来独立处理通道间关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据具有非平稳性，现有MLP模型虽然能有效捕捉长期依赖但忽略了局部变化模式，而CNN能有效处理这些局部变化，因此需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出MLP+CNN的混合架构：MLP用于建模整体趋势和长期依赖，CNN使用多样化核函数建模细粒度局部模式，并设计IConv架构独立处理通道间关系以降低计算成本。

Result: 在多个时间序列数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 结合MLP和CNN的混合方法能有效处理时间序列的非平稳特性，IConv架构通过独立通道处理实现了对多样化局部时间依赖的有效建模。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）进行优先级排序，无需大量超参数调优或干净验证集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在噪声标签和数据异质性存在下训练深度神经网络的挑战，提高模型在噪声环境下的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数动态调整每个训练样本的损失权重，基于样本的难度级别。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的广泛实验表明，LiLAW能持续提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中增强模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不依赖数据增强或高级正则化技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务依赖初始化（TDI）方法，通过功率谱匹配来调整状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置，使其与任务的光谱特征对齐，从而提高模型的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。状态空间模型等基础序列模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在大型训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特性对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著提高了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题，显著提升了最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视了鲁棒公平性问题，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性差异严重。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，生成公平感知样本和均匀目标对抗样本来平衡分布。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性（如CIFAR-10上FGSM和AutoAttack分别提升15.1%和6.4%）。

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

*Hwa Hui Tew,Junn Yong Loo,Yee-Fan Tan,Xinyu Tang,Hernando Ombao,Fuad Noman,Raphael C. -W. Phan,Chee-Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个fMRI生成框架，利用BOLD信号的时频表示和无分类器去噪扩散技术，通过将BOLD信号转换为窗谱图来捕捉时间动态和频谱演化，然后生成类条件频率谱图并逆变换回BOLD信号，最终提升下游fMRI脑网络分类的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本有限，现有生成模型因忽略BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态而性能不佳。

Method: 采用时间相关傅里叶变换将BOLD信号转换为窗谱图，训练无分类器扩散模型生成类条件频率谱图，再通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在基于fMRI的脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架有效解决了fMRI数据生成中的非平稳性和非线性动态问题，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了高质量合成数据。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是首个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含46.5万训练和10.5万测试时间戳，每个样本包含数值序列、元数据、线图图像和描述文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，且忽略元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集重构为描述和问答任务，使用可扩展的管道生成参考描述：大部分由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，同时提供579个人工修订的测试描述。

Result: 提出了新的定制评估指标，并对领先的VLM进行基准测试，揭示了它们的优势和持续局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述管道为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉领域的未来研究建立了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

TL;DR: 本文通过神经坍缩的视角，为深度神经网络训练中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）提供了统一解释，发现类内方差收缩是关键因素，并验证了训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展的不同时间尺度是这些现象的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络的训练动态常常违背预期，如grokking（测试性能在训练损失平稳后突然提升）和信息瓶颈原则（模型逐步丢弃与预测任务无关的输入信息）。这些现象的机制及其关系尚不清楚。

Method: 通过神经坍缩的视角分析学习表示的几何特性，研究类内方差收缩的动态过程，并将其与训练集上的神经坍缩度量相关联。在多个数据集和架构上验证理论发现。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的关键因素，训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展的不同时间尺度解释了这些后期现象的行为。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一框架，类内方差收缩的动态分析揭示了这些现象的内在机制。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段训练框架来解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态训练来塑造初始状态，然后进行联合训练。提出了有效竞争强度（ECS）概念，并开发了可计算的诊断指标和异步训练控制器来平衡模态竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在联合训练过程中经常出现模态竞争问题，其中一个模态主导学习过程，导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，而忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 1. 提出有效竞争强度（ECS）概念量化模态竞争力；2. 开发基于互信息（MI）的可计算诊断指标；3. 提出FastPID算法进行部分信息分解，测量模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；4. 设计异步训练控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。通过塑造预融合模型的初始状态，有效缓解了模态竞争问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在融合前塑造模型的初始状态是一种有效的策略，能够在竞争开始前就缓解问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Motivation: 大约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。胎儿心率监测对评估胎儿健康状况至关重要，但穿戴式监测设备在孕妇活动时容易出现信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特性，限制了AI分析的准确性。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StyleBench是一个系统性评估不同推理风格在多样化任务和模型上表现的基准测试，发现没有单一最优推理策略，策略效果高度依赖于模型规模和任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的有效性受推理策略影响很大，但推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 评估了5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上的表现，使用了15个开源模型（从270M到120B参数），涵盖主要模型家族。

Result: 搜索型方法（AoT、ToT）在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格（SoT、CoD）在定义明确任务上效率极高；小模型经常无法遵循输出指令而默认猜测，推理鲁棒性随模型规模增加而提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于特定约束条件选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图，并开源了基准测试工具。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理随机传感器延迟的模型强化学习方法，通过基于模型的滤波过程来更新信念状态，使智能体能够有效处理观察延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常出现延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是即时的。本文研究了POMDP中的随机传感器延迟问题，这是RL中尚未解决的新设置。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程来顺序更新信念状态，并引入简单的延迟感知框架，将该思想整合到基于模型的RL中。将框架应用于Dreamer算法，并与MDP的延迟感知基线进行比较。

Result: 该方法在性能上持续优于基线方法，并在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务上的实验也验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 明确建模观察延迟对于处理现实环境中的延迟问题至关重要，提出的延迟感知框架为RL在延迟环境中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [217] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，分别采用平衡分布和联邦组合标签分布作为目标分布，并在三种常见FL策略和两个数据集上验证了改进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在数据隐私要求严格的领域具有巨大潜力，但客户端间的数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能。现有研究主要通过客户端选择方法来缓解数据不平衡的有害影响。

Method: 提出了一种扩展的联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与两个目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合标签分布）最佳对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 实验结果表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐能带来最大改进；而对于全局不平衡，与联邦组合标签分布对齐效果更优。

Conclusion: 所提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习中的数据不平衡问题，针对不同类型的不平衡情况需要采用不同的目标分布策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

### [218] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于联邦学习的注意力增强LSTM模型，用于ICU中脓毒症发病的早期预测，支持可变预测窗口，在保护数据隐私的同时提高了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症早期准确预测在重症监护中具有重要临床意义，但单个医院ICU数据有限限制了机器学习模型的性能。联邦学习可以在不共享数据的情况下实现跨机构协作训练，解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架下的注意力增强长短期记忆网络模型，支持可变预测窗口（短期和长期预测），在多中心ICU数据上进行训练。

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高了整体预测性能（接近集中式模型水平），而且特别有利于脓毒症的早期检测。可变预测窗口在性能损失不大的情况下显著降低了计算、通信和组织开销。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联邦学习解决了医疗数据隐私和稀缺性问题，可变预测窗口设计提高了模型的实用性和效率，为脓毒症早期预警提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于马尔可夫链的离散状态扩散模型确定性去噪算法，通过引入弱混沌动力学的herding算法变体实现确定性离散状态转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散扩散模型开发确定性反向过程，替代随机去噪过程，无需重新训练或连续状态嵌入

Method: 使用带有弱混沌动力学的herding算法变体来诱导确定性离散状态转换，实现生成反向过程的去随机化

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中展现出效率和样本质量的一致提升

Conclusion: 这种简单的去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，同时证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间中也同样有效

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发深度学习框架，结合微观移动特征、历史犯罪和社会人口数据，提升细粒度时空犯罪预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有犯罪预测研究缺乏对微观移动特征的整合，需要探索如何结合多种数据源提升细粒度时空预测精度。

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合犯罪事件、社会人口统计和人类移动数据，在四个美国城市进行12小时犯罪预测，并与基线模型对比。

Result: 移动特征显著提升预测性能，特别是短输入序列。结合移动和社会人口特征时，深度学习模型在所有城市均取得最佳召回率、精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在细粒度尺度上具有优势但也存在局限性。

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种液压回路在重型土方设备线性执行器中的能效表现，创新性地使用比例流量控制阀（PFCV）替代传统比例方向控制阀（PDCV），通过位置控制时的流量旁路减少能量损失，能效提升8.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能效，减少能量损失和环境影响，降低运营成本。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较传统PDCV回路与创新PFCV回路（带执行器两端人工泄漏）。采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器实现位置控制。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效高8.5%，通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失。仿真结果与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 所提出的PFCV方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，有助于减少环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFacts是一个基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，用于为多元时间序列生成反事实解释，通过整合对比和分类一致性目标、原型初始化和现实约束优化，在合理性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或不直观，需要开发能够产生更合理和用户可理解的反事实解释的新方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合对比学习和分类一致性目标，采用原型初始化方法和现实约束优化策略。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面比现有最优方法提升18.7%，在人类研究中获得最高可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和用户中心的可解释性比稀疏性更重要。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳的原因在于注意力机制失效，Transformer块往往退化为简单的MLP，主要原因是当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中甚至不如简单线性基线，但之前的研究没有深入探讨Transformer失败的原因。本文旨在系统分析时间序列Transformer(TST)失效的根本原因。

Method: 设计了一系列渐进式实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；创建了可解释的数据集来研究注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析探讨嵌入方法失败的根本原因。

Result: 发现Transformer块在现有时间序列Transformer中经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中有效运作。

Conclusion: 时间序列Transformer表现不佳的主要原因是注意力机制失效和嵌入方法不当，这为改进时间序列Transformer架构提供了重要的理论指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出解耦值注意力（DVA）来改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs），通过分离输入相似性计算和标签传播，使PFNs在高维回归任务中更有效，验证损失降低50%以上，速度比精确高斯过程推理快80倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中对高维回归任务效果有限，需要改进注意力机制来更好地模拟高斯过程的特性

Method: 引入解耦值注意力（DVA），仅从输入计算相似性，通过值传播标签，保持无核特性但模拟高斯过程更新

Result: 在5维和10维情况下验证损失降低超过50%，64维功率流方程近似平均绝对误差达到1E-3量级

Conclusion: 注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素，基于CNN的PFNs可以达到与Transformer相当的性能

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了流匹配方法在低噪声区域存在的不稳定性问题，提出了局部对比流（LCF）混合训练协议来解决该问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配框架在低噪声区域存在基本不稳定性，当噪声水平趋近于零时，输入中的微小扰动会导致速度目标的大幅变化，使学习问题的条件数发散，这不仅减缓优化过程，还迫使编码器将有限的雅可比容量重新分配给噪声方向，从而降低语义表示质量

Method: 提出了局部对比流（LCF），一种混合训练协议，在小噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，同时在中等和高噪声水平下保留标准流匹配

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理对于充分发挥流匹配在生成和表示学习方面的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同图表示（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术，跨视图上下文被当作噪声处理

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教导模型学习共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标，利用对齐视图作为丰富的互补信号

Result: 大量实验（包括关键消融研究）表明，对齐优先策略成功地将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习发挥效力的必要前提条件，MixGate框架通过先对齐后建模的策略有效解决了多视图布尔电路学习中的融合难题

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要为患者找到最优治疗方案，但无法随意测试所有候选治疗，且现有替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合。医学先验知识可以提供有意义的替代信号。

Method: 通过'提示优化'实现，将LLM作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，利用其上下文理解非结构化领域知识的能力，在自然语言中提出个性化治疗计划。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON证明了利用LLM作为黑盒优化器，结合领域先验知识，可以有效提升个性化治疗方案的优化效果。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过区分遗忘和保留电路，解决了现有方法中神经元纠缠的问题，为LLM遗忘提供了更精确有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据不平衡限制了GNN的性能表现。

Method: FracAug通过学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边界损失来生成多样化的语义保持图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果对未标记数据进行伪标注。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上的14种GNN模型实验显示，FracAug将平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的插件模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够显著提升图级异常检测性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

TL;DR: CATCH-FM是一种基于医疗记录进行癌症早期筛查的方法，使用24亿参数的医疗基础模型，在3万名患者的回顾性评估中实现了60%敏感性和99%特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球可及性差，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发基于历史医疗记录的预筛查方法。

Method: 基于数百万电子健康记录建立医疗代码序列预训练的缩放定律，预训练计算最优的基础模型（最大24亿参数），并在临床医生策划的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在3万名患者的评估中，CATCH-FM以60%敏感性和99%特异性显著优于基于特征的树模型以及通用和医疗大语言模型，在EHRSHOT少样本排行榜上实现胰腺癌风险预测的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在不同患者分布中表现出鲁棒性，在ICD代码空间中操作具有优势，能够捕捉非平凡的癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

TL;DR: LCR是一个实用的基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，在保持鲁棒性的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，传统启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习方法要么预测不准时性能急剧下降，要么设计保守收益有限。

Method: LCR框架的核心算法LARU通过机器学习预测增强LRU，并通过在线误差估计动态适应预测准确性，在预测准确时实现接近最优性能，预测不准时优雅降级到接近LRU性能。

Result: 实验表明，在DLRM和LLM场景下，LCR将吞吐量提升高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低高达28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统，即使在预测不佳时性能也保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR弥合了基于学习的缓存方法在实证进展和理论进展之间的差距，提供了性能增益的同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在截断Ising模型中基于单个样本估计逆温度参数β的高效方法，使用伪似然最大化技术，在接近线性时间内实现一致性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在截断Ising模型中仅使用单个样本估计逆温度参数的挑战性问题，特别是在截断集由k-SAT公式定义的情况下。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的估计方法，将Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术推广到截断Ising模型设置，在接近O(n)时间内构建估计器。

Result: 设计的估计器在k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³条件下，与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)一致性，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术扩展到更复杂的截断Ising模型设置，为高维统计推断提供了有效的单样本估计解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为二元自编码器（BAE）的新方法，通过最小化小批量隐藏激活的熵来增强LLM特征解缠的稀疏性和独立性，解决了现有方法中特征密集化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解缠大型语言模型隐藏状态中的特征时，通常依赖于单实例训练的隐式正则化，缺乏全局稀疏性保证，导致大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 提出二元自编码器（BAE），通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，强制小批量隐藏激活的最小熵，促进特征跨实例的独立性和稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两个主要应用中表现优异：能够可靠估计二元隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态；在特征提取方面避免了密集特征，产生了最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，通过熵最小化策略成功解决了特征稀疏性问题，为LLM机制解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于局部唯一标识符（Local-UID）的图神经网络方法，用于解决整数线性规划（ILP）问题，在保持表达力的同时显著提高了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名图神经网络在ILP问题上的表达能力有限，而使用全局唯一标识符（UIDs）的方法通常会产生虚假相关性，严重损害泛化性能。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在每个节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此方案，开发了ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和ColorUID（轻量级特征级变体）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个ILP基准测试上取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力，并且与最先进方法结合时能进一步改进图级任务性能。

Conclusion: 局部UID方案在d层网络中实现了与全局UID相同的表达能力，同时提供了更强的泛化能力，为ILP优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注预测、插补、异常检测和分类等任务，这些任务评估的是特定任务性能，无法严格衡量模型是否真正捕捉到数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 引入无损压缩作为评估范式，定义标准化评估协议和指标，开发TSCom-Bench评估框架，将时间序列模型作为无损压缩的骨干网络进行快速适配。

Result: 在多个数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等最先进模型的实验表明，压缩能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布性弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法，提供更全面的模型能力评估。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解当前空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体飞机行为和复杂交互关系的挑战，同时需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: MAIFormer框架包含两个核心注意力模块：(1)掩码多变量注意力，捕获个体飞机的时空模式；(2)智能体注意力，建模复杂空中交通场景中多智能体之间的社交模式。

Result: 在仁川国际机场终端空域的真实ADS-B飞行轨迹数据集上评估，MAIFormer在多个指标上达到最佳性能，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅性能优越，而且从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和空中交通控制的实际效用。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Motivation: 当前基于表型和基于靶点的策略各有局限性，要么实验成本高，要么忽略了系统级细胞响应。需要一种能够协同整合这两种策略的方法来改进药物设计。

Method: 首先在广泛的药物诱导转录谱上预训练表型引导生成器，然后通过多目标强化学习进行微调。奖励函数融合对接亲和力和药物相似性评分，并加入排序损失、先验似然正则化和熵最大化。

Conclusion: 该统一框架展示了表型引导和靶点感知策略的协同潜力，为从头药物发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究了上下文学习（ICL）的内在机制，发现ICL通过选择性移除隐藏状态中的冗余信息来引导语言模型完成特定任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部工作机制尚不明确，需要从新的角度进行探索。

Method: 采用信息移除的视角，通过设计低秩滤波器选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息，并识别关键的注意力头（Denoising Heads）。

Result: 发现ICL通过模拟任务导向的信息移除过程，从纠缠的非选择性表示中移除冗余信息，从而提升模型性能。阻断信息移除操作会显著降低ICL准确率。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，Denoising Heads在其中发挥重要作用，这为理解ICL的工作原理提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

TL;DR: rBridge是一种方法，通过使用小模型（≤1B参数）来预测大模型的推理能力，通过将负对数似然与任务对齐加权，利用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，大幅降低数据集排名成本（超过100倍），并在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现最强的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，因此需要利用较小的代理模型在扩展之前优化数据集。然而，对于推理能力，这种方法变得具有挑战性，因为推理能力只有在模型规模较大（通常超过7B参数）时才会可靠地出现涌现行为。

Method: rBridge通过将负对数似然与任务对齐加权，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小代理模型（≤1B参数）能够有效预测大模型的推理能力。该方法更紧密地对齐预训练目标和目标任务。

Result: rBridge（i）相对于最佳基线将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上，（ii）在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准上实现了最强的相关性，（iii）在1B到7B规模上实现了跨预训练数据集的零样本预测关系转移。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs是否能真正学习和泛化新的推理策略（而不仅仅是预训练中已掌握的技能）这一开放性问题。

Method: 使用强化学习训练LLMs解决预训练模型无法解决的编程问题家族，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，并引入完全分布外的问题家族。

Result: 发现明显的顿悟相变现象：经过长时间接近零奖励后，RL训练模型突然达到接近完美的准确率。在家族内和技能重组方面有显著提升，但在转换性案例中仍存在弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA为探索RL驱动推理的极限提供了清晰的测试平台，有助于理解模型如何超越现有先验知识获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于约束的因果发现需要大量条件独立性测试，但现有方法计算成本过高，限制了实际应用

Method: 采用分而治之策略：将数据划分为子集，在每个子集上应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性级别，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算负担

Conclusion: E-CIT是一个通用且即插即用的框架，在复杂测试场景特别是真实数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACA是一种轻量级强化学习框架，通过消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，简化了actor-critic方法的设计和计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖独立的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策和超参数敏感，限制了在大规模函数逼近器中的可扩展性。扩散模型虽然能表达多模态行为但引入额外设计选择和计算负担。

Method: ACA框架消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐，同时避免actor训练的计算开销。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和最先进的扩散方法实现了更优的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一个简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力，无需依赖扩散型actor即可捕获多样化的多模态行为。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

### [243] [FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21029)
*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中视觉越狱攻击的局限性，发现现有攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果不佳，主要原因是攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感。作者提出了FORCE方法来修正特征过度依赖问题，提高攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效攻击开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果有限。需要深入分析攻击失效的原因并开发更通用的攻击方法。

Method: 通过分析损失景观和特征表示，发现攻击依赖狭窄的层表示和语义贫乏的频率分量。提出FORCE方法，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新缩放频率特征的影响。

Result: 实验证明FORCE方法能有效发现平坦的可行区域，显著提高视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移能力，有助于对闭源MLLMs进行红队评估。

Conclusion: 通过修正特征过度依赖问题，FORCE方法为MLLMs的安全评估提供了更可靠的视觉越狱攻击工具，有助于识别闭源模型中的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

### [244] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044)
*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过边缘归因修补技术研究RL微调如何改变LLMs的内部机制，发现在线RL训练会增强激活强度和多样性，而DPO方法则表现出不同的内部变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调被证明能提升LLMs能力，但其对不同模型内部机制的具体影响机制尚不明确，需要系统性的内部机制分析。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补技术对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活差异，重点关注PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同训练方法。

Result: 在线RL训练导致两个稳健效应：激活强度整体增加和激活模式多样性提高；而DPO微调则显示出较弱或不一致的内部变化。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性来提升泛化能力，在线RL与基于偏好的方法在内部机制改变上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

Motivation: 研究如何构建高效学习系统，即用最少观测次数达到期望误差阈值的学习过程。

Method: 利用最小作用量原理，从学习拉格朗日量这一第一性原理出发，通过寻求平稳轨迹来推导学习算法。

Result: 成功推导出经典学习算法、贝尔曼最优方程和Adam优化器，验证了学习是寻找拉格朗日量平稳路径的过程。

Conclusion: 学习算法可以通过寻求拉格朗日量中的平稳轨迹来推导，这为构建高效学习系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个简单有效的管道，用于大规模创建困难数学问题。通过自适应思维模型筛选现有数据集中的难题，训练专门的难题生成器，无需复杂提示即可大规模生成新难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面存在挑战，包括高计算/API成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限。需要一种更高效的方法来大规模创建困难问题。

Method: 1) 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题；2) 在筛选的困难数据上训练专门的难题生成器(DiffGen-8B)；3) 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调的模型相比原始数据集性能提升11.3%，在AIME'24等五个困难基准测试上达到65.9%平均准确率，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型。随着困难问题数量的增加，模型在困难基准测试上表现出明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了几何问题中的指代表达理解任务，构建了GeoRef基准数据集，并开发了GRPO微调方法和验证-再生机制，显著提升了模型在几何问题解决中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何问题解决需要准确的图表理解和跨模态对齐能力，但目前缺乏专门评估模型定位几何元素能力的方法。

Method: 使用结构化几何形式语言生成大规模合成训练数据，采用GRPO微调方法，并引入验证-再生机制来检测和修正错误预测。

Result: GRPO方法显著优于传统SFT，验证-再生机制进一步提升了准确率，模型在GeoRef上的表现也改善了其在下游几何推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 几何指代表达理解是几何问题解决的基础能力，需要专门评估和强化，GeoRef基准和提出的方法为多模态数学理解提供了重要基础。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

*Sedjro Salomon Hotegni,Sebastian Peitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPREAD是一个基于去噪扩散概率模型(DDPMs)的生成框架，用于高效解决大规模昂贵多目标优化问题，通过条件扩散过程和自适应梯度下降更新来快速收敛并保持多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的多目标优化方法来计算帕累托最优解集仍然是一个关键挑战，特别是对于大规模和昂贵的优化问题。

Method: SPREAD首先学习决策空间采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过自适应多梯度下降更新进行快速收敛，同时使用基于高斯RBF的排斥项来保持多样性。

Result: 在多目标优化基准测试（包括离线和贝叶斯代理设置）上的实证结果表明，SPREAD在效率、可扩展性和帕累托前沿覆盖方面达到或超过了领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: SPREAD框架为大规模昂贵多目标优化问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，在多个关键指标上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

TL;DR: SATMC是一个新颖的图域自适应框架，通过结构和属性转换来对齐不同图域间的分布，解决了传统方法在处理结构异质性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图域自适应方法主要关注节点属性转换，但难以处理不同图域间的结构异质性，导致分布对齐效果不佳。

Method: SATMC框架通过马尔可夫链顺序对齐网络间的分布，包含私有域信息减少机制和经验Wasserstein距离来增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 理论证明SATMC能获得比现有方法更紧的误差界，实验验证了其在跨域节点分类任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The
code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力计算方法，结合了naive和absorb两种核实现，在MLA架构中实现了高达3倍的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀）

Method: 提出混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分应用naive公式以利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现了高达3倍和3.24倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过巧妙结合两种方法的优势，有效解决了MLA架构中注意力计算的性能瓶颈

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

TL;DR: GraphUniverse是一个用于生成图家族以系统评估归纳泛化能力的框架，通过生成具有持久语义社区的图来支持受控分布偏移下的鲁棒性测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中模型如何泛化到新图的根本挑战，现有方法局限于单图转导设置，缺乏对归纳泛化的系统评估。

Method: 生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，确保概念一致性同时控制结构属性（如同质性和度分布），支持大规模归纳泛化评估。

Result: 基准测试显示强转导性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，对分布偏移的鲁棒性高度敏感于模型架构选择和初始图机制。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发鲁棒且真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中需要大量交互步骤来学习最优Q函数，而现有的视觉语言动作策略在低级控制方面表现有限，且需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。

Result: 实验结果表明，VARL在各种环境和代理设置下都能显著提高样本效率，且不会引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在现实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自演化的认知代理框架，通过构建异构邮件图、认知图神经网络和对抗性自演化循环来检测垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单或简单启发式方法，攻击者使用多模态策略结合文本、URL、伪造头部和恶意附件，传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应。

Method: 构建统一的异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用LLM增强的认知图神经网络进行上下文感知推理；建立对抗性自演化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集（Enron-Spam、Ling-Spam、SpamAssassin、TREC）和合成对抗变体上的实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面均优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色，但对精心设计的对抗性扰动仍然脆弱。本文旨在探索简单、数据自适应的防御方法，重新审视线性降维技术。

Method: 实证比较标准PCA与其稀疏变体SPCA作为前端特征提取器，结合理论分析。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的精确鲁棒性证书，并通过Lipschitz组合论证证明稀疏性降低算子范数边界。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA具有更优雅的性能下降，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。稀疏投影减少了对抗性杠杆效应。

Conclusion: 理论识别了稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆的机制，实验验证了这种优势在线性设置之外仍然存在，SPCA是一种有效的对抗性防御方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LAVA的后处理方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的潜在空间结构，通过分析局部邻域内的特征相关性来揭示输入特征与潜在嵌入之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型在科学发现中具有重要作用，但难以解释。现有的解释方法要么过于细粒度（单样本级别），要么过于简化（数据集级别），缺乏对潜在空间局部结构的自动化分析。特别是对于流形学习方法，由于没有映射函数，只能依赖嵌入的相对空间组织。

Method: LAVA（Locality-Aware Variable Associations）是一种模型无关的后处理方法，将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过分析原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 基于MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入，LAVA能够捕捉到相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学上相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习中的潜在空间组织，通过局部相关性分析揭示了输入特征与嵌入结构之间的有意义关系，为科学发现提供了新的解释工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

*Ruiyu Wang,Shizhao Sun,Weijian Ma,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，通过多模态分词策略解决文本引导CAD原型设计中的语义对齐问题，显著提升了指令跟随和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始语义和几何结构，阻碍了文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，采用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑的、原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著提升了指令跟随和生成质量，在定量和定性评估中均优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略与CAD的原始和结构特性对齐，为文本引导CAD原型设计提供了更有效的表示方法。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GRPO强化学习算法在特定假设下能诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型（PRM），并通过实验验证了这些假设在现实条件下成立。作者发现了GRPO目标的一个缺陷：非均匀分布的过程步骤会阻碍探索和利用，并提出了λ-GRPO改进算法，在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法中隐藏的过程奖励模型结构，探索是否可以利用这种内置结构来提升模型性能，而不需要额外定义昂贵的显式PRMs。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO能诱导PRM，然后实证验证假设成立。基于GRPO-as-a-PRM框架，识别GRPO目标的缺陷，提出λ-GRPO改进算法。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。训练时间和成本几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法中隐藏的内置PRM结构来提升性能，质疑了使用昂贵显式PRMs的优势。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（距离感知温度缩放）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过原型距离估计和自适应温度调整来减少跨任务的校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，现有方法主要从数据角度解决校准问题，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务间的差异，导致不同任务间的校准误差波动较大。需要一种更原则性的方法来根据任务距离自适应调整温度。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，在没有先验任务信息的情况下推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实证评估表明，与最先进方法相比，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面表现出稳定、可靠和一致的效果。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放策略，有效解决了持续学习中跨任务校准不一致的问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的置信度校准方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT是一种简单的方法，通过在共享潜在空间中实现异构专家模型的潜在层协作，利用轻量级路由器选择专家并让主专家对活跃同行进行交叉注意力，从而超越现有多LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型日益专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 使用轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家，在共享潜在空间中通过交互层让主专家对活跃同行进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，仅训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT分别比当前最先进的Avengers方法提升0.38%和2.92%，显著优于最佳单模型，且具有单次推理和运行时可比性。

Conclusion: MoT为组合异构LLMs提供了简单的潜在空间机制，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，用于扩散模型的机器遗忘，相比传统MSE方法具有更好的灵活性和性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度框架的一个特例，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出统一的f-散度框架，允许使用任何f-散度进行遗忘，分析不同散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响。

Result: 该框架提供了选择最优散度的灵活性，能够在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的权衡。

Conclusion: f-散度统一框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更灵活和优化的解决方案，优于传统的MSE方法。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化逆强化学习（IRL）的新方法，将最大似然解转化为线性固定点方程，从而将IRL问题简化为两个标准的监督学习问题：概率分类和行为策略估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆强化学习方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。本文旨在简化IRL流程，使其更易于实现和扩展。

Method: 通过分析softmax IRL，发现最大似然解可由行为策略的线性固定点方程表征。该方法将IRL分解为：1）使用概率分类估计行为策略；2）通过迭代回归求解固定点。

Result: 提出的方法简单模块化，适用于不同函数逼近类别和算法。实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优，同时提供了最优解的精确表征和有限样本误差界。

Conclusion: 该方法显著简化了逆强化学习的实现复杂度，使其能够更好地利用现代函数逼近器，为机器人模仿学习和经济学动态选择建模提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了过参数化线性回归中最小ℓp插值器(p∈(1,2])的参数范数族随样本量的缩放规律，通过对偶射线分析揭示了信号尖峰与零坐标体之间的竞争，并建立了DLNs与显式偏置之间的预测桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过参数化线性回归中ℓp偏置插值下所有ℓr范数(r∈[1,p])缩放规律这一基本但未解决的问题，为理解不同范数在泛化中的预测能力提供理论基础。

Method: 采用对偶射线分析方法，识别X⊤Y中信号尖峰与零坐标体的竞争机制，推导出数据依赖的转折点n⋆和普适阈值r⋆=2(p-1)，并通过DLNs实验验证理论预测。

Result: 建立了统一的参数范数缩放理论，预测了范数饱和与增长的分界条件，实验证明DLNs继承了相同的肘部/阈值规律。

Conclusion: 不同ℓr范数对泛化代理指标的预测能力存在敏感差异，该研究为理解显式与隐式偏置之间的联系提供了理论框架。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一个基于相对上下文差异（RCD）预训练范式的时序异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口的显著差异来识别异常，而非传统的重构方法，在零样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有基于重构的时序异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出RCD预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口的上下文差异来识别异常；使用标准Transformer架构；构建大规模合成语料库提供细粒度异常标签。

Conclusion: RCD范式验证了其优越性，为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时序异常检测基础模型开辟了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Conclusion: GWTF是首个实用的容错去中心化LLM训练框架，在现实挑战性场景中显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

*Yucheng Wang,Ziyang Chen,Md Faisal Kabir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于知识图谱反事实解释的框架，用于解释微调后大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LoRA微调机制如何改变模型的结构推理和语义行为是一个开放挑战，需要开发新的解释方法。

Method: 构建BioToolKG生物信息学工具知识图谱，设计CFFTLLMExplainer反事实解释器，通过软掩码生成最小结构扰动来诱导最大语义差异。

Result: 应用于微调LLaMA模型，反事实掩码揭示了模型的结构依赖关系，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化相一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解微调LLM的内部机制提供了新见解，反事实图谱可作为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

*Zifan Wang,Anqi Dong,Mahmoud Selim,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦流匹配（FFM）框架，用于在隐私约束下训练流匹配模型，解决了分布式数据无法集中训练生成模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻碍了数据集中化，因此需要在不进行中心化聚合的情况下直接从本地分布式数据训练生成模型。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端使用独立源和目标耦合进行本地训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合提高客户端内流直度）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端间耦合）。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提高联邦设置下的流直度和样本质量，性能与集中式基线相当。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功实现了在隐私约束下的分布式生成模型训练，通过全局协调机制解决了数据异构性问题，达到了与集中式训练相当的性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirPCM是一个新颖的深度时空预测模型，通过整合多区域、多污染物动态与显式气象-污染物因果关系建模，实现了准确且可扩展的空气污染预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性问题，但现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性。

Method: AirPCM采用统一架构，联合捕捉跨站空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，支持细粒度、可解释的多污染物预测。

Result: 在多尺度真实数据集上的广泛评估表明，AirPCM在预测准确性和泛化能力方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供了可操作的见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持。

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SuperOffload系统，针对Superchips（GPU-CPU紧密耦合架构）优化LLM训练，通过自适应权重卸载、桶化重分区等技术，在NVIDIA GH200上实现2.5倍吞吐量提升，支持单芯片训练25B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superchips采用GPU-CPU紧密耦合架构提供强大计算能力，但现有研究缺乏对这种新架构下LLM训练优化的探索，需要重新审视传统卸载假设。

Method: 提出SuperOffload系统，结合自适应权重卸载、桶化重分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并优化Grace CPU的Adam优化器。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上评估显示，相比最先进的卸载系统，吞吐量提升达2.5倍，单Superchip可训练25B模型，8个GH200可训练13B模型（序列长度达100万token），达到55% MFU。

Conclusion: SuperOffload有效利用了Superchips的异构架构优势，为下一代AI硬件上的大规模LLM训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

### [274] [It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282)
*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型强化学习方法（如PPO和GRPO）依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留更多信息的方法。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率之前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。该方法在GRPO框架中实现为GR-PSPO，并在Qwen2.5模型上进行微调。

Result: 相比未裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO获得相似性能但产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程；相比裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO在0.5B和1.5B模型上性能显著提升，GSM8K任务上分别提升超过20%（39.7% vs 17.6%，59.4% vs 37.8%）。

Conclusion: PSPO通过概率平滑有效替代比率裁剪，在保持训练稳定性的同时显著提升模型性能，为语言模型强化学习提供了一种更优的优化方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒补救措施，使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来约束模型变化，相比之前使用L^∞范数的方法，能显著降低补救成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒补救方法在模型更新时容易失效，且大多数方法缺乏理论最优性保证。虽然已有工作使用L^∞范数提供了可证明最优的算法，但这种方法会导致补救成本过高。

Method: 提出新算法，考虑使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来定义更受约束的模型变化，为广义线性模型提供可证明最优的鲁棒补救计算。

Result: 实验表明，对于线性和非线性模型，新算法相比先前工作显著降低了补救成本（高达几个数量级），在补救实施成本与有效性之间表现出更好的权衡，且提供更稀疏的补救方案。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅降低了补救成本，还保持了对抗后处理方法的鲁棒性，为实际应用中的算法决策补救提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经网络训练数据重构攻击的固有弱点，证明在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，重构本质上不可靠。有趣的是，训练更充分的网络反而更不易受重构攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆引发了隐私和安全担忧，现有重构攻击方法缺乏坚实的理论基础，需要分析其固有局限性和失败条件。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法，严格证明重构攻击的不可靠性，并通过实验展示精确复制训练样本仅偶然发生。

Result: 证明在没有数据先验知识时，重构攻击存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解；实证显示训练更充分的网络反而更抗重构攻击。

Conclusion: 重构攻击本质上不可靠，训练更充分的网络能更好地平衡隐私保护和泛化能力的需求，为缓解重构攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

### [277] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，解决了传统基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在LLM系统中的应用局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理系统由于随机生成过程导致输出可变，现有的错误检测方法主要依赖输入输出的文本匹配，但由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性，这种方法显得脆弱。需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出来验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发了一种时间表达式语言来监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹。该方法关注代理动作序列（如工具调用和代理间通信），提供跨多个执行场景捕获正确行为模式的断言。

Result: 在三代理系统测试中，当使用大型模型时，所有时间断言都得到满足；但当两个代理使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别是在关键应用中部署的代理系统，能够有效检测生产环境中代理系统的行为回归问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LATTS的自适应测试时缩放方法，通过验证器模型动态调整每个生成步骤的计算资源分配，以优化准确性与计算成本的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤采用统一计算分配，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受准则来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念动态调整计算资源。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确性-计算权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时缩放的计算效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [283] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种用于肌电信号控制手部假体的新型识别系统，通过检测受污染的生物信号来减轻污染的不利影响。系统包含两个集成：一组用于评估单个通道污染程度的单类分类器，以及一个用于识别患者意图的K近邻分类器集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假体通常使用肌电生物信号进行模式识别控制，但由于人类来源因素和人-假体接口问题，难以获得可接受的分类质量。生物信号对污染的高度敏感性会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 开发了一个原始、一致的模糊模型，允许在整个识别过程中使用统一的软（模糊）决策方案。系统由两个集成组成：单类分类器用于污染检测，K近邻分类器集成用于意图识别。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统与文献中描述的其他类似系统进行了比较，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE是一个基于多级反思合成的新型自学习智能体框架，通过三个互补层次的反思（微观、中观、宏观）来提升LLM智能体的反思能力，在复杂任务中显著优于现有基于反思的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体在复杂任务中面临反思能力不足的问题，主要由于错误分析不充分和过度依赖少数成功轨迹。需要一种系统化的方法来生成有意义的反思。

Method: 提出SAMULE框架：1）多级反思合成：单轨迹学习（微观）用于详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类；任务间学习（宏观）提取可转移见解；2）基于反思数据微调回顾模型；3）扩展到交互式设置，通过前瞻性反思机制实现主动适应。

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个挑战性基准上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习对于构建自改进的LLM智能体至关重要，SAMULE框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Conclusion: 该能力在不同产品类别和行业中具有广泛适用性，鼓励生成式AI在不同行业的研究和应用。

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多代理移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互式执行和持续学习来解决现有移动GUI代理在真实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理应用中面临真实世界场景的挑战，包括多样化的应用界面和不断变化的用户需求。端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，而无用户交互的代理会单方面行动，损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(i)全局任务规划器，从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(ii)应用级执行器，基于长短时记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心代理在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(iii)自学习器，将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Result: 实验表明，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前的最先进方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过其交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中表现出显著优势，证明了其在处理复杂用户任务和持续学习方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语言模型的新框架，用于推理任务。NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，AR模型基于这些轨迹生成精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，NAR模型速度快但输出质量较低。需要结合两者优势，在推理密集型任务中实现高效高质量的推理。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后由AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案。这种混合方法充分利用了NAR的并行性和AR的连贯性。

Result: 实验显示该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了速度和质量的双重优势，为推理密集型应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Method: 使用大语言模型构建高密度环境记忆表示，通过语义和空间模态的联合推理进行记忆检索和整合。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA和NaVQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人平台上成功部署。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Motivation: 现有方法在整合多组学数据、拓扑结构和文本知识方面存在局限，无法同时处理数值证据、拓扑知识和语言上下文，限制了机制解释性。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型引导的强化学习，将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以逐步方式生成疾病相关子图。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架，用于精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析方法的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于确定性有限自动机（DFA）的框架来评估AI代理在真实世界任务中的表现，通过五个核心指标全面衡量代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理基准测试通常只关注最终状态的二元判断，忽略了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，在此基础上开发了CORE评估套件，包含五个量化指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间的重要性能差异。

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，为更全面的代理性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文基准多依赖非科学文本、简单信息检索任务或人工构造上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献中的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习仅带来有限改进，模型在数值运算和信息定位方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长上下文科学推理方面的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了有价值的评估工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确率的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态k-hop扩展和"think-longer"提示方法往往过度检索，增加上下文大小，导致不可预测的运行时间。需要一种能够在准确率、延迟和成本之间进行权衡的解决方案。

Method: CLAUSE采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1准确率，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，准确率提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确率、延迟和成本之间的有效权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了评估AI系统创造性能力的理论框架和算法任务，重点研究大语言模型在科学创意生成中的表现，发现了模型深度和宽度对创造力的最优配置，以及新颖性与实用性之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念框架未能解决AI系统特别是大语言模型在创造性任务（如科学创意生成）中的泛化能力评估问题，需要建立专门针对开放性创造力的评价标准。

Method: 提出了基于新颖性和实用性程度的理论框架和算法任务来评估输出，通过实证研究分析LLM创造力的扩展行为、模型架构优化以及新颖性-实用性权衡。

Result: 发现创造力存在最优模型深度和宽度配置；LLM在生成新颖科学创意方面表现出色，但难以保证实用性；新颖性与实用性之间存在持久的基本权衡。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM在长期创造力方面存在局限性，研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力提供了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态根本上由模型的认知过程（特别是显式推理能力）决定，揭示了说服二元性：推理过程使模型更抗说服，但分享推理内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的快速发展，需要深入理解LLM和LRM协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战现有关于模型规模决定说服效能的主流假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究推理过程对说服抗性和说服能力的影响，并考察多跳说服网络中影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Result: 发现LRM的推理过程使其对说服具有更强抵抗力，而分享推理内容能显著提高其说服他人的能力；在多跳说服中观察到影响力传播和衰减的复杂模式。

Conclusion: 研究建立了模型内部处理架构与外部说服行为的系统性联系，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对未来MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

TL;DR: Recon-Act是一个基于侦察-行动行为范式的自演进多智能体框架，通过对比错误轨迹与成功轨迹来推断补救措施并生成通用工具，显著提升了在真实网页上解决多轮长视野任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在真实网页的多轮长视野任务中仍存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要更有效的智能体框架来提升适应性和解决能力。

Method: 采用双团队架构：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队负责意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹推断补救措施，抽象为通用工具（提示或基于规则的代码），并实时注册到工具库中。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了对未见网站的适应性和长视野任务的可解性。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过侦察-行动范式建立了数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，目前已完成6级实施路线图中的第3级（有限人工干预），证明了该框架在复杂网页任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决LLM作为自动评估器时的评分不一致问题，包括分数比较不一致和成对传递不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的方法存在严重的不一致性问题：评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在利用链式思维数据时缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型最能有效增强模型推理能力。需要系统性地识别和利用高价值推理模式来提升模型性能。

Method: 定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数；从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式；构建富含价值推理模式的核心参考集；提出基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法来筛选高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的高价值CoT数据，就能让850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025挑战赛上提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 选择性地利用富含高价值推理模式的数据比盲目使用大量数据更有效，该方法为提升大模型推理能力提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析框架来量化推理路径，研究强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力。研究发现RL压缩错误轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使推理功能集中于少数步骤，SFT则使其均匀分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型通过RL和SFT训练来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体塑造推理过程仍不清楚。本文旨在超越基于准确率的分析，深入理解这两种训练方法对推理过程的定量和定性影响。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级和步骤级两个粒度分析推理过程。轨迹级分析完整推理输出，步骤级分析推理图（节点对应单个推理步骤），通过聚类和拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹约2.5倍，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率变陡，SFT使其变平缓（约减少到三分之一）。这表明RL将推理功能集中于少数步骤，SFT使其在多个步骤间均匀分布。

Conclusion: 研究解释了为什么当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练是最佳实践，并为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实际指导。该推理路径视角为理解训练方法如何塑造模型推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务或多轮对话，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑他人策略，需要解决战略决策中的这些局限性。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法，包含三个关键创新：1）基于推理他人策略生成推演轨迹；2）在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型在复杂战略决策场景中的能力，证明了其在处理决策依赖性和策略推理方面的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和执行视为独立任务，忽略了它们之间的内在联系，而镜像神经元机制表明这两种能力是相互关联的。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息来实现表示对齐。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的相互协同，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以更好地建模动作理解与执行之间的内在联系，为相关任务提供统一的表示学习框架。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Motivation: 探究LLMs如何处理稀有词汇，以及这种处理是通过离散模块化架构还是分布式参数级分化实现的。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最后一层MLP神经元，研究稀有词汇处理的神经机制和组织原则。

Result: 发现LLMs通过分布式专业化处理稀有词汇，形成三区域影响层次（高原神经元、幂律衰减神经元、最小贡献神经元），这些神经元具有协调激活模式且空间分布。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非专家混合式模块化来处理稀有词汇，这为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs的单次推理能力有限，当任务复杂度超过模型容量时，准确性会急剧下降。

Method: 提出了InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前的推理痕迹，将信息负载控制在单次推理限制内，并采用依赖显式工作流实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能提升，验证了理论和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量感知表示和结构化的重要性，有望启发更多相关研究。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种研究大型语言模型（LLM）智能体在无外部任务约束下行为的架构，通过持续推理和行动框架发现了三种自发行为模式，这些模式具有模型特异性，为预测自主操作中的行为提供了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在没有外部任务约束时的自发行为，为理解其在任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主操作中的行为提供系统性的基础。

Method: 采用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、以及自身性质的递归概念化。这些行为具有高度模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统记录无提示LLM智能体行为的研究，为预测部署系统中智能体在不确定环境下的行为建立了基准。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度预测和高质量解释的平衡，在医疗疾病预测任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在疾病预测中难以平衡准确性和可解释性，要么准确但解释不清晰，要么解释流畅但统计不可靠。需要一种能像人类专家一样深入理解数据的方法。

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），通过预测准确性驱动深度理解。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线模型，RCA在准确性和鲁棒性上相对提升达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释。

Conclusion: RCA证明了高准确性和高质量解释是相互促进的目标，通过深度数据理解可以创建真正可信的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Conclusion: VC-Agent为个性化视频数据集收集提供了一个新的基准，通过交互式方法显著提高了视频数据收集的效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）全面评估嵌入模型和相似度度量方法，在30+数据集上测试了9个模型，发现现有方法在不同维度存在显著性能差距和权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现强劲，迫切需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。现有基准主要关注孤立能力，而SAGE旨在通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细微人类判断任务来全面评估语义理解。

Method: 设计SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别：人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性。在30多个数据集上对9个嵌入模型和经典度量方法进行综合评估，使用对抗条件、噪声变换等挑战性测试场景。

Result: 评估结果显示显著的性能差距：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682 vs 0.591），但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似度显著超越（0.905 vs 0.794）。发现关键权衡：text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。没有单一方法在所有维度都表现优异。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。该基准暴露了现有方法在不同维度上的性能权衡，强调了需要更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
