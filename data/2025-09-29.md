*Valentin Samokhin,Boris Shirokikh,Mikhail Goncharov,Dmitriy Umerenkov,Maksim Bobrin,Ivan Oseledets,Dmitry Dylov,Mikhail Belyaev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直接偏好优化(DPO)的模型无关框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需奖励模型或人工标注，可提升放射学报告生成模型的临床性能指标达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展，但缺乏专门针对医疗领域的优化方法。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，通过随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外的奖励模型或人工偏好标注，可以灵活地增强现有的SOTA模型。

Result: 在三个最先进的模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升了高达5%，且不需要任何额外的训练数据。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

### [2] [Improving Autism Detection with Multimodal Behavioral Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21352)
*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多模态行为分析的自闭症谱系障碍计算机辅助诊断方法，通过整合面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为等特征，在大型平衡数据集上实现了74%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症谱系障碍诊断过程复杂且资源密集，现有计算机辅助诊断方法在注视特征性能不佳和缺乏现实世界泛化能力方面存在局限，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的大型标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析（面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性、注视行为），并引入新的统计描述符来量化注视角度变异性，最后采用后期融合方法整合各模态特征。

Result: 新型注视统计描述符将基于注视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后总体分类准确率达到74%，验证了多模态行为标记在自闭症检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明基于视频的多模态行为分析具有开发可扩展自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够为自闭症评估提供支持，且计算发现与临床研究中关于ASC患者注视回避的观察结果一致。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来解决VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存增长问题，实现推理加速和内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人感知和控制中具有统一性优势，但其可扩展性受到注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长的制约，现有方法往往忽视推理效率对实时部署的重要性。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留近期细节同时积极修剪过时低相关内存，保持因果关系。

Result: 理论上可实现1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小，能够无缝集成到现有自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: 该方法在不修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑的情况下，实现了可扩展的推理，解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中发现的错误及其位置，通过合成数据集训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型能够生成逼真的放射学报告，但在推理过程中会产生事实错误和幻觉，阻碍了临床应用的推广。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来检测报告中的错误。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上展示了发现真实性预测和定位的准确性，与基于真实标签的验证达到了0.997的和谐相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器产生的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDF-MLLM多模态深度学习架构，通过融合视网膜图像的多尺度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升视网膜疾病分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM模型难以捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键空间细节特征，需要改进多模态融合方法。

Method: 集成U-Net编码器的跳跃特征到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力模块，采用补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和FiLM调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在1305个眼底图像-文本对上，MDF-MLLM达到94%准确率，比基线MLLM提升56%，召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了可泛化、可解释的模块化框架，在临床决策支持系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，通过图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义组件，绕过文本到图像模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，对基于图像的输入漏洞探索不足，且文本方法难以绕过模型安全过滤器。

Method: 使用大语言模型将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，重写有害提示为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像描述来迭代优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了多模态输入在安全绕过方面的潜力，为T2I模型的安全防护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过联合利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测监督来训练显著性检测网络的方法，使用相互学习模块提升性能，在多个数据集上达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在显著目标检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，这些问题源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作中的步长。

Method: 1. 将显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务交织训练，生成均匀高亮的显著性图；2. 前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导，实现精确的前景轮廓预测并减少边缘预测的局部噪声；3. 开发相互学习模块(MLM)，通过多分支网络进行相互学习。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，证明该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用多种监督任务和相互学习机制，有效解决了显著目标检测中的不完整预测和边界不准确问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAJORScore是一个新的多模态相关性评估指标，首次通过多模态联合表示来评估三个及以上模态的相关性，相比现有方法在一致性模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标主要基于双模态数据的预训练对比学习模型（如CLIP），仅适用于两个模态之间的关联分析，这极大地限制了多模态相似性评估的能力。

Method: 通过多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到相同的潜在空间中，从而在一个尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平的相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上相比现有方法提升了26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低了13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore作为更可靠的评估指标，适用于大规模多模态数据集的相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析脚手架结构，实现自动化监测，提高检查准确性和施工安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患，需要更准确高效的自动化检测方法

Method: 构建云AI平台处理脚手架点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据与最新点云数据来检测结构修改

Result: 提出的系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术能够显著提升脚手架检查的准确性，有助于改善施工现场安全状况

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自动提示工程框架，通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器来生成反事实尺寸图像，提升文本到图像生成的精细可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中反事实可控性的挑战，特别是反事实尺寸控制（如生成微小海象和巨大按钮），这对于创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 构建包含图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练排序器的自动提示工程框架，创建首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，并改进Grounded SAM图像评估器。

Result: 图像评估器性能相比骨干网络提升114%，实验表明该方法优于最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实图像生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在实现非荧光超分辨率光学显微镜方面的性能，发现在不同信噪比条件下两种模型具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，提供一种经济有效的超分辨率方法，避免使用昂贵的专用设备或荧光技术。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，在非荧光相位调制显微镜模式下(如Zernike相衬和微分干涉对比显微镜)，对通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种模型在超分辨率重建方面表现良好但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比共同影响深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能表现，即使使用相同的训练数据和训练周期。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和Transformer机制实现视听导航，在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视听导航中仅进行基础的多模态融合，忽视了更深层次的感知上下文信息。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合改进的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上，DMTF-AVN在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注促进概念-神经元的一对一映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元的多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练，通过系统化概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中比现有技术提升9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进概念-神经元的一对一映射，显著提高了文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，结合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，通过卷积神经网络和循环神经网络捕捉空间和时间模式来预测乳腺癌风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的乳腺X光片，且缺乏对现实世界中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，在具有典型临床筛查不平衡病例对照比的大规模人群筛查数据集上进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多种不同先验检查数量和组成的场景中，LongiMam在包含先验乳腺X光片时持续改善预测性能。先验和当前访问的组合优于单次访问模型，而仅使用先验检查效果较差。模型在关键风险群体中均表现有效，特别是在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。LongiMam已作为开源软件公开发布。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了CNN与人类大脑在社交认知任务中的对应关系，发现CNN难以超越简单的视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理。同时提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CNN与人类大脑在复杂社交认知任务（如图像情感评估）中的对应关系，而不仅仅是基础视觉感知。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为及fMRI数据的对齐程度，并开发Object2Brain框架结合GradCAM和对象检测来分析不同对象类别的影响。

Result: CNN在情感评估任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: CNN在社交认知等高阶任务中与人类大脑处理存在差异，需要更复杂的模型来捕捉这些复杂认知过程。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，通过移除和重训练两个步骤来修正概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型虽然允许专家干预错误概念，但无法解决模型从有偏数据中学习捷径的系统性偏差问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 移除步骤 - 专家识别并移除不期望的概念；2) 重训练步骤 - 使用CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，进行监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法，有效减少了模型对不期望概念的依赖。

Conclusion: 该框架为概念瓶颈模型提供了一种有效的系统性偏差调试方法，通过可解释性实现了从概念反馈到样本级修正的转换。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的自动化沉船检测解决方案，显著提高了从多波束声纳数据中发现沉船的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝如何影响神经网络的可解释性，发现轻到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低概念一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以在保持性能的同时被大幅剪枝，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下的Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients解释方法，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取追踪语义一致性的变化。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义有意义的概念；而过度剪枝合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管保持了准确率。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表征使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会削弱可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个仅使用多视角图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，就能联合进行室内布局估计和3D物体检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而纯视觉数据更为常见。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用有姿态图像，(iii)使用无姿态图像。在3D物体检测方面与专门方法相当，在布局估计方面显著提升。

Conclusion: TUN3D为整体室内场景理解设立了新的基准，实现了紧凑且语义丰富的空间表示。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该系统通过精细化语义粒度划分和轻量级部署策略，成功提升了图像传输的语义保真度和视觉质量，同时优化了资源利用效率。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间为形状分析提供了理论严谨且实用的层次简化框架，扩展了传统骨架表示的能力。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要高分辨率气候预测来支持本地决策。

Method: 在观测性高分辨率网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提高气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练，在多个基准测试中优于更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE等）无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂。视频理解领域的自动评估方法相对未被充分探索。

Method: 使用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，从而训练专门的MLLM评估器。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，7B参数的VideoJudge优于更大的基线模型（如32B和72B的Qwen2.5-VL）。发现纯文本LLM评估器表现不如MLLM评估器。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要，长链思维推理并不能提高性能，专门的MLLM评估器在视频理解评估中表现优异。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化实现高效压缩，在保持精度的同时大幅降低通信带宽需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过信息共享提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来支持实际部署。

Method: 采用端到端方法，首先通过简单瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后使用多阶段残差向量量化，仅传输每个像素的码本索引来大幅减少数据量。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上，ReVQom实现了273倍到1365倍的压缩比（6-30 bpp），在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持可接受的性能退化。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为V2X实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究显示当前文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时存在严重的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，其中DALL-E V3性别偏见最严重，输出图像96%为男性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性。

Method: 使用中性提示词通过ImageFX、DALL-E V3和Grok生成1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估，第三方资深研究员仲裁分歧，共产生10,100个判断。

Result: 所有模型都显示强烈性别不平衡：ImageFX 85%男性，Grok 86.6%男性，DALL-E V3 96%男性。领导和技术角色偏见最明显，且普遍存在服装、环境和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中的人类社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种不当内容类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深对问题定义和标注指南的理解）、CoT（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，并对未见问题展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差距和复杂问题定义挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于坐标预测的GUI定位方法在高分辨率复杂布局界面中表现不佳，因为视觉语言模型难以准确预测数字坐标

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互搜索任务，模型通过多步强化学习训练，在每一步判断目标对象、评估空间关系并移动光标

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2数据集上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例在两步内解决问题

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，模型能够自适应地调整搜索步数，在复杂GUI定位任务中实现最先进性能

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对难以识别和检查，余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 在现有基准上增加视频标注以支持语义理解并减少数据偏差；设计检索CoT，包含成对比较步骤，生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT经验上提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，同时促进了模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过LLM CoT推理实现了可解释的文本-视频检索，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有的基于自然/工业图像的自动缺陷检测方法无法有效迁移到手术领域，存在误报、对小缺陷敏感度不足和领域偏移等问题。

Method: 整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效领域适应，专门针对手术器械图像优化无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地检测手术器械图像中的细粒度缺陷，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为手术器械的缺陷检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过领域特定的优化实现了可靠的缺陷检测性能。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的替代方案来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化，将线性可分性直接融入网络学习动态，无需辅助编码器和表示对齐，通过促进中间层表示的线性可分性来训练模型。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiT）上，显著提高了训练效率和生成质量，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到FID 1.46。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了表示对齐，将线性探测直接整合到学习过程中，实现了高效训练和高质量生成，无需依赖外部编码器。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本的图像对）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远的图像对）。

Method: 提出空间正则化对比学习策略，整合半变异函数来建模特征空间距离与地理距离的关系，定义期望视觉差异作为参考来识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上评估，显示显式建模空间先验能提高图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间统计工具半变异函数，提出的方法能有效利用空间依赖性，提升图像地理定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Motivation: 解决从单张图像预测物体运动的问题，现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在简单物理场景中预测运动仍存在困难，因为它们需要生成像素而非直接建模运动。

Method: 将任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格，采用现代视频生成器架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，直接建模场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比现有回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地预测物体运动，视频生成器在从单张图像预测运动方面存在局限性，因为像素生成带来了额外开销。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为系统设计提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作区分度（6.16倍分离比）方面表现更好，而V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更稳定（方差0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别但运动依赖动作性能下降，V-JEPA2的时间建模提供更平衡的表示质量，选择应基于任务需求和可靠性约束。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于表示相似性度量的框架，用于分析不同视觉模型家族的表示特性，发现几何结构和单元调谐携带家族特异性特征，而线性可解码信息则更广泛共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表示特征是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表示相似性度量（RSA、Soft Matching、Linear Predictivity等），并通过相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合这些互补的度量结果。

Result: 几何和调谐度量能强区分模型家族，而线性可解码性度量区分较弱。SNF融合后获得更清晰的家族分离，发现监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，而所有自监督模型跨架构边界聚集。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类法，表明新兴计算策略（由架构和训练目标共同塑造）定义了超越表面设计类别的表示结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过在冻结的视频基础模型中添加可训练的几何分支，实现视频潜在空间和隐式3D场的联合建模，从而提升3D感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。

Method: 引入交叉分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld在多个视图一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线，能够有效桥接视频想象和3D感知。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干网络和跨分支信息交换实现了3D感知视频表示，几何分支的潜在表示可直接用于下游3D任务而无需逐场景优化。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能无缝处理异构时空数据集，支持不同数据维度（1D-3D）、分辨率和混合标量/向量场，通过组件卷积、跨场注意力等创新架构实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学机器学习中处理异构、多模态科学观测数据的挑战，开发一个能够灵活处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的统一模型框架。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和向量通道，跨场注意力建模不同物理场间信息传播，轴向注意力降低计算负担。使用预训练和参数高效微调（LoRA）。

Result: 在多个下游预测任务中，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化方面均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越现有强基线方法和最新SOTA模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为学习异构多模态科学观测数据提供了灵活强大的基础架构，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习开辟了新路径。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出MS-YOLO模型，通过使用MobileNetV4主干网络和SlideLoss损失函数，在红外图像目标检测中实现高效准确的目标检测，特别适用于边缘计算场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像在低光照和恶劣天气条件下具有优势，但类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等问题影响模型性能。需要开发既高效又准确的目标检测方法。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet主干网络以减少计算量，并提出SlideLoss损失函数动态关注欠表示和被遮挡样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性的mAP和优越的精度，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了在保持高检测质量的同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，非常适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新轨迹查询，减少查询冲突，提升多目标跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪框架将检测和跟踪查询在单一Transformer解码器层中联合处理，导致冲突和关联精度下降

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer，显式预测物体跨帧运动来提前更新轨迹查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9分，达到71.3的SOTA；SportsMOT 72.2 HOTA；BDD100k 54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR：一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的对齐和特征聚合。


<details>

Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效稳健的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Result: 自监督微调的AFRL-DINOv2模型在SAR基础模型中达到了新的最先进水平，显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，并在下游环境挑战（如扩展操作条件和少标签数据）中表现出色。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，虽然取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的构建仍有很长的路要走，希望这项工作能为未来SAR基础模型建设提供参考和启发。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以实现可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,

Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（利用大语言模型生成情感词典，通过结构化情感树生成综合语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过有效整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息，显著提升了群体情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型直接应用于医学图像分割存在三个主要挑战：边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足以及缺乏不确定性量化，这些限制了其在临床环境中的可靠性。

Method: KG-SAM整合了三个关键组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床场景可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验显示，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中分别达到MRI 78.05%和CT 79.68%的Dice分数。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个鲁棒且可推广的框架，能够显著推进医学图像分割的发展。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: UniVid框架通过微调预训练的视频生成模型，使用视觉句子表示各种视觉任务，实现了跨模态和跨源任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉模型需要针对不同模态和任务进行特定预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。受大语言模型的启发，探索预训练视频生成模型是否能适应多样化的图像和视频任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散变换器来处理各种视觉任务，无需任务特定修改。任务表示为视觉句子，上下文序列定义任务和期望输出模态。

Result: 尽管仅在自然视频数据上训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频组合）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上都表现出良好的泛化能力。理解和生成任务可以通过简单反转视觉句子顺序来切换。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为视觉建模的可扩展统一基础，提供更高效和灵活的任务处理方式。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

*Wenyi Gong,Mieszko Lis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，能够与空间架构兼容，在保持空间结构的同时实现token减少，在多种视觉任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、相对位置编码等），现有token减少方法无法保持这些架构所依赖的空间结构，因此需要开发能够保持空间完整性的token合并方法。

Method: 采用2D减少策略保持结构化token布局，空间感知合并算法维持相对token位置，以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速，COCO上仅0.7% mIOU下降；在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速，ImageNet上top-1准确率无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够与空间架构无缝兼容，在保持空间结构的同时实现高效的token减少，在多种视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出GASP-ICL框架，无需训练即可增强大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中的性能，通过任务感知知识注入和自适应评分器提升检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中面临挑战，包括难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 使用GASP-ICL框架，包括MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器(GSTAS)捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过语义对齐的任务相关演示选择，有效增强了LVLMs在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法提取统一特征处理视频中的所有动作，难以在多动作场景中建模不同对象间的交互。

Method: 使用时空场景图(SSG)和动态提示模块(DPM)引导图解析神经网络(GPNN)生成动作特定表示，并设计视频适应的GPNN使用动态权重聚合信息。

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效从复杂场景中分离指定动作，提升多动作场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过创新的训练方法和奖励设计显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Conclusion: LongScape框架通过混合方法和智能分块机制，成功解决了长时程视频生成的挑战，为高质量具身操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中实现了最先进的任务成功率，并展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoWM框架有效融合了不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，未能充分利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 使用LLM分离前景背景提示词，提出STD-RoPE通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异，增强轨迹控制能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT提供了一种简单有效的轨迹控制解决方案，无需额外训练即可实现精确控制。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Motivation: Transformer模型在问答领域取得进展，但多跳推理（需要结合多个段落证据）仍然困难，需要改进检索策略来支持多跳问答。

Method: 在检索增强生成框架中比较余弦相似度、最大边际相关性和混合方法（结合稠密嵌入、词汇重叠和重排序），并采用EfficientRAG管道进行查询优化，包括token标记和迭代优化。

Result: 混合方法在HotpotQA数据集上表现最佳，相比余弦相似度在精确匹配和F1分数上分别提升50%和47%，改善了实体召回和证据互补性。

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但真实世界场景经常包含动态元素（如移动物体、变化光照等），这带来了更复杂的挑战。

Method: 提出基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，包含创新的动态色调映射模块，该模块根据时间维度上辐射分布的变化动态调整色调映射函数，保持时间辐射一致性。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法，能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了动态场景的HDR新视角合成问题，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Conclusion: SRHand能够从低分辨率输入中重建出包含皱纹、指甲等精细细节的3D手部几何和纹理图像，同时保持多视角和姿态一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

Motivation: 现代图像生成技术的普及引发了对其滥用的担忧，当前研究主要关注检测"虚假"图像，但忽视了"真实"图像的定义和数据质量问题。作者认为需要重新审视"真实"图像的概念，因为现代摄影技术也使用神经网络处理图像。

Method: 这是一篇观点性论文，通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出其依赖过时低分辨率数据集的问题，并基于现代智能手机图像处理技术的特点，提出需要重新定义"真实"图像的概念。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁研究界重新思考"真实"图像的概念，建立新的基准数据集，并质疑检测"虚假"图像这一目标本身是否合理。建议至少需要明确的"真实"图像技术定义和新的基准数据集。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够在统一框架中增强美学评分和推理能力，使多模态大语言模型能够生成有根据的解释和可信的评分。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法难以在文本驱动的3D场景生成中实现精确的物体运动控制，需要开发能够无缝集成物体轨迹定义与3D场景合成的统一框架。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 通过3D复制粘贴方法将物体网格合成到场景中，并应用物理感知位置学习；3) 使用部分增强的运动条件视频扩散模型实现时间动画。

Result: 实现了在高质量3D背景中用户控制物体运动的统一架构，展示了协调一致的物体运动对齐效果。

Conclusion: Drag4D框架有效解决了3D场景生成中的物体运动控制问题，通过多阶段方法实现了视觉完整且运动一致的3D场景合成。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，生成与音频精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动精确时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的离同步模型引导全模型）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Syncphony模型能够生成与音频精确同步的高质量视频，并通过CycleSync度量验证了其同步性能的优越性。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

*Yixiao Liu,Yizhou Yang,Jinwen Li,Jun Tao,Ruoyu Li,Xiangkun Wang,Min Zhu,Junlong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的遥感变化检测模型LG-CD，通过自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，显著提升变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型SAM2提取多尺度金字塔特征，通过多层适配器微调模型，设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息，采用视觉-语义融合解码器深度整合多模态信息。

Result: 在三个数据集(LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD、SYSU-CD)上的实验表明，LG-CD始终优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

*Qihang Wang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的扩散框架，结合文本和拖拽交互进行图像编辑，解决了文本驱动方法缺乏空间控制和拖拽驱动方法缺乏纹理指导的互补局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，而拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状和结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导。需要结合两者的优势来实现更全面的图像编辑。

Method: 提出了两个关键创新：1）点云确定性拖拽，通过3D特征映射增强潜在空间布局控制；2）拖拽-文本引导去噪，在去噪过程中动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性实验表明，该方法不仅实现了高保真度的联合编辑，而且在仅文本或仅拖拽设置下的性能也匹配或超越了专门的单模式方法。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了一个多功能且可推广的解决方案，支持灵活的编辑模式（仅文本、仅拖拽或组合条件），为可控图像操作提供了通用框架。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 解决北欧地区无人机图像中车辆检测面临的强能见度挑战和雪覆盖引起的领域偏移问题，同时利用廉价的无标注数据来改进检测性能。

Method: 使用对比学习在无标注数据上预训练CNN特征提取器，然后将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中进行微调，比较了多种融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，mAP50指标提升了3.8%到9.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的sideload-CL-adaptation框架能有效利用无标注数据提升轻量级模型的车辆检测性能，特别适用于北欧地区的挑战性环境。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法要么需要模型特定的反演设计，要么需要大量优化，限制了利用最新图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域

Method: 使用向量场校正与样本偏差来将源视频信息融入去噪过程，通过结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时间相关噪声，并采用偏差缓存机制最小化计算成本

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: IF-V2V提供了一个轻量级的即插即用解决方案，实现了视觉创意

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角计数方法大多依赖完全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 提出SSLCounter框架，利用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关外观。该方法可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅达到最先进性能，而且在使用仅70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争性表现，展示了卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体积渲染，有效解决了多视角计数对标注数据的依赖问题，在数据效率方面表现出色，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性基准测试，用于评估基础模型中的物体中心空间推理能力，发现检测器和视觉语言模型在空间定位与关系推理之间存在稳定权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位精度，但忽略了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 发现检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）能提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）能提供粗略布局线索和流畅描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位能力与真正空间理解之间的差距，指出了社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中过度依赖单个上下文对的问题，提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测结果存在偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出了基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上（前景分割、目标检测、着色、多目标分割、关键点检测）均优于强基线方法，对领域偏移具有强鲁棒性，并能泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且高效的训练免费框架，能够显著提升视觉上下文学习的性能和鲁棒性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计框架，仅需单张RGB参考图像，无需深度传感器、多视图图像采集或训练视图合成模型。通过改进深度预测和深度感知匹配，在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法存在局限性：依赖深度传感器在透明或高反射表面会失效；RGB方法在低光和纹理缺失场景下匹配性能不足。需要一种不依赖深度传感器且能处理挑战性条件的解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和新优化损失，提升挑战性表面的深度预测精度；2. 引入深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中有效整合空间关系，处理挑战性材料和光照条件的匹配。

Result: 1. 深度预测在REAL275上相比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%；2. 在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计评估显示，平均召回率比最先进方法提升6.1%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D提供了一个轻量级且鲁棒的6D姿态估计解决方案，在资源受限和挑战性条件下表现优异，无需昂贵的深度传感器或多视图采集。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Motivation: 现有的基础模型特别是基于Transformer解码器的模型存在高计算开销和缺乏可解释性的问题，限制了在资源受限场景中的部署。

Method: 采用可训练的硬特征选择器进行稀疏操作，并将特征选择集成到提前退出机制中，使用贝叶斯优化确定最优退出阈值。

Conclusion: DynaNav框架有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SemanticControl方法，能够在文本到图像生成中有效利用未对齐但语义相关的视觉条件，通过自适应抑制视觉条件与文本提示冲突的部分来提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet模型需要精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实践中往往难以获得，特别是对于不常见或想象性场景。当使用未对齐的视觉条件时，现有方法会产生文本保真度低或视觉伪影的问题。

Method: 提出训练无关的方法，首先使用与视觉条件对齐的代理提示进行辅助去噪过程，提取信息性注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域并增强文本引导。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在深度图、边缘图和人体骨架等各种未对齐条件下都能提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl方法能够有效利用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件，解决了现有ControlNet模型在实际应用中的局限性。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在限制，包括忽略合理回答、有限的情感分类、忽视上下文因素和人工标注成本高，需要开发更好的评估框架来测试MLLMs的情感感知能力。

Method: 提出情感陈述判断任务，并设计自动化流程高效构建以情感为中心的陈述，最小化人工工作量。

Result: 主流MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限；与人类相比，即使是GPT4o等顶级模型也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架和进行全面MLLM评估，这项工作有助于推进MLLMs的情感智能发展。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型迁移监督，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解有限、分解不可控和泛化能力差。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，使用基于triplane的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token；通过模型在环标注流程从在线资源中整理超过500万个3D形状-部件对。

Result: PartSAM在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，实现了高度准确的部件识别，并能自动分解形状为表面和内部结构。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出的决定性一步，其代码和模型即将发布。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Motivation: 图像对比度是视觉感知的基本因素，对整体图像质量至关重要，但大多数无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估不同真实世界条件下的对比度失真。

Method: 定制和微调三个预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2），使用对比度感知回归头，并在包含合成和真实对比度失真的CID2013和CCID2014基准数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: 定制的EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越了传统方法和其他深度基线。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了对轻量级预训练网络进行对比度感知适应可以产生高性能、可扩展的无参考对比度质量评估解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下的泛化能力不足问题，传统监督微调方法需要大量标注数据，在少样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式Geo-R1，采用"先推理后行动"的策略：先生成明确的、可解释的推理链来分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理结果来定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型始终显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的强化微调范式，在少样本地理空间指代表达理解任务中实现了更好的泛化性能和可解释性，为解决数据稀缺场景下的遥感图像理解问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中的临床奉承行为，提出了一个医学奉承数据集和轻量级缓解策略VIPER，通过过滤非证据内容来减少奉承行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中日益普及，但它们经常表现出奉承行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而不是基于证据的推理。

Method: 从PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD构建医学奉承数据集，使用心理学动机的压力模板进行对抗性实验，并提出VIPER框架过滤非证据内容生成约束性证据优先答案。

Result: 发现各种VLM模型普遍易受攻击，表现出显著的对抗性响应变化，与模型准确性或大小的相关性较弱。模仿和专家提供的修正被发现是最有效的触发因素。

Conclusion: VIPER框架平均减少了奉承行为，优于基线方法，同时保持可解释性。该基准分析和缓解框架为医学VLM在真实世界临床医生交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一个利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式和口语问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户的注视数据被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据存在模糊性挑战：口语问题使用代词或跳过上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式嘈杂且与口语问题存在复杂时空关系。

Method: 首先分析注视模态的查询样本，展示用户注视模式的嘈杂性；然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成流程生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进的视觉语言模型中，同时保留其预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手建立可用且直观的交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了大型视觉语言模型的空间偏见问题，发现模型对图像中相同视觉信息在不同位置会产生不一致输出，并提出平衡位置分配机制来提升空间鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。研究发现当关键视觉信息放置在不同位置时，模型会产生不一致的输出，这揭示了其空间语义理解的根本局限性。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析空间偏见，发现问题的根源在于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合。

Result: 实验表明，BaPA机制无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升其在多样化多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生平衡的注意力，实现更全面的视觉理解。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的不平衡设计是导致LVLMs空间偏见的主要原因，BaPA机制通过平衡位置分配有效缓解了这一问题，提升了模型的空间鲁棒性和整体性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法有效解决了感知不确定性，在保持高准确性的同时显著提升了视觉语言任务的效率。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

Motivation: 传统基于学习的深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在细纹理或深度突变区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出变分公式，包含空间约束和焦距约束：空间约束利用不同聚焦级别的梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影；焦距约束强制单峰、单调的聚焦概率，符合物理聚焦行为。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的归纳偏置提高了在挑战性区域的鲁棒性和准确性，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: 信息论为多智能体协作感知提供了理论基础，RDcomm框架证明了理论指导下的通信策略设计能显著提升效率

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: 静态基准测试对文本到图像模型的诊断能力有限，难以发现系统性失败的全貌或隔离根本原因，需要主动探索范式来补充。

Method: 将错误发现构建为对最小失败诱导概念的结构化搜索问题，采用新颖的加速技术解决计算爆炸问题。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas为深度模型审计提供了原则性和可扩展的引擎，建立了以诊断优先的新方法学，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间揭示隐含幻觉信号作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用这两个锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，拉近忠实语义表示，推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，例如使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B在CHAIR上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，同时保持召回率和描述丰富度，在多种架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎没有副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，包含多样化样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个迭代阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生过多任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，这源于它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT包含三个迭代阶段：(1)多样化样本生成：生成多样化推理样本来探索潜在推理路径；(2)双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展严格评估样本；(3)视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中使用Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next模型，实现了3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过创建推理引导视觉焦点、视觉焦点指导后续推理的相互依赖循环，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域尚未得到系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术。

Method: 构建了包含语音、视线、身体动作和视觉上下文的多模态面对面教学数据集，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的性能。

Result: 多模态大语言模型即使在没有任务特定微调的情况下，也优于专门的基线模型，显示出其在理解教学互动方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型有望实现对教学互动的整体理解，为教育支持和技能转移提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Motivation: 现有方法将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的比较评估表明，DAVIS的两个变体在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉声源分离任务方面具有显著效果，DAVIS展示了生成建模在音频分离领域的潜力。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Conclusion: 统一的空频域学习对于鲁棒且可泛化的深度伪造检测是有效的

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成材质属性，这在多样化光照环境中对真实感渲染至关重要。

Method: 首先微调基于深度和法线图的多视角材质扩散模型，然后利用生成的多视角PBR图像探索高斯材质表示，与2D高斯泼溅对齐并建模PBR材质的每个通道。

Conclusion: MGM框架能够生成高质量的3D内容，具备PBR材质属性，实现了动态重光照能力，为3D内容创作提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯溅射场景，解决了现有方法的三个关键缺陷：依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练、单义设计限制以及跨视图语义不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)跨视图语义不一致性会破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成并提升多粒度2D掩码到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组。然后使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过视觉语言模型从最具代表性的视角解释对象外观，提取鲁棒的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单义限制。

Conclusion: 通过消除昂贵的逐场景训练过程，MUSplat实现了高效的开放词汇3D语义理解，在性能和效率上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合性基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球过半人口，需要从人类中心视角理解其结构和感知变化。现有基准在城市环境中的评估有限，缺乏对时间演化和主观感知的系统探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时相街景图像，通过空间聚类、规则生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLM，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅1.5%。模型在场景理解任务中表现良好，但在时间推理任务中表现下降，主观感知维度中多个模型达到或超过人类一致性。

Conclusion: MLLM在城市发展理解方面展现出潜力，特别是在场景理解和主观感知方面，但在时间推理方面仍需改进。UrbanFeel为评估MLLM在城市环境中的能力提供了全面基准。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

TL;DR: 提出了EXCL方法，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道解决无源无监督域自适应问题，在无需源数据的情况下实现高性能域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协作检索、分别微调、学习目标一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法通过有效利用双专家协同学习，在无源数据的情况下实现了优异的域自适应性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 提出三步创新：1) OSIE管道避免迭代过程；2) BG-Shield技术选择性修改编辑区域特征；3) SSCA机制抑制语义泄漏到背景。

Result: 实验显示FlashEdit在保持背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比之前多步方法提速150倍以上。

Conclusion: FlashEdit实现了高质量实时图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在真实临床推理任务上表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试主要关注分类准确率，造成模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败的评估幻觉，需要专门设计评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 构建包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑但推理密集型基准，涵盖鉴别诊断、病灶识别和推理生成三大任务家族，采用结合LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度指标的混合评分流程。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等最先进VLM的系统评估显示，相比传统数据集性能急剧下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是模型主要缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，为临床可信AI提供严格且经济有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: UniMapGen是一个用于大规模地图构建的生成式框架，通过将车道线表示为离散序列并使用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图矢量，支持多模态输入以克服卫星数据缺陷，并采用状态更新策略确保全局连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和劳动密集型标注过程，现有卫星方法存在遮挡、过时等固有缺陷，以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 将车道线表示为离散序列并建立迭代生成策略；提出支持BEV、PV和文本提示的多模态输入灵活架构；开发状态更新策略确保全局连续性和一致性。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过生成式方法和多模态输入有效解决了传统地图构建方法的效率问题和卫星数据的固有缺陷，为大规模地图构建提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的统一框架，从多视角图像同时进行网格重建和材质分解，无需依赖外部模型先验，能够处理高反射表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且往往依赖外部模型先验来增强分解结果。

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失和优化过程。

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，生成三角形网格及其关联的材质组件，适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: GS-2M提供了一个有效的统一解决方案，能够同时处理网格重建和材质分解，对高反射表面具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高级任务指令与桌面场景之间的语义鸿沟，为机器人任务训练提供了高质量的合成场景数据。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 在文档分析领域，强化学习应用较少，但许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验，考察三种不同的分布外场景。

Result: 强化学习在分布外图像、未见类别和不同模态三种场景下都表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和文本到图像模型的越狱攻击，但文本到视频模型的安全性仍未被充分研究，存在重大安全漏洞。

Method: SceneSplit方法将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间。通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器，并使用策略库重用成功攻击模式来提高攻击效果和鲁棒性。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，这为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合近期模型预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但其输出在较少的神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度下仍显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均之间的差异来引导采样过程，无需额外计算，可无缝集成到现有扩散框架中。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新记录。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够实现更快速度、更高保真度的扩散采样。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割中存在的"效率/鲁棒性冲突"问题，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时，轻量方法往往存在表示脆弱的问题。

Method: 采用可部署和可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)，实现"一瞥一聚焦"原则。通过模态交互和多尺度图像检索，以及基于Gram矩阵的空间解耦知识迁移(SDKT)来增强表示能力。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升了分割性能，为实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion
models trained with convolutional neural networks, and classical patch-based
texture optimization techniques. NIFTY is a non-parametric flow-matching model
built on non-local patch matching, which avoids the need for neural network
training while alleviating common shortcomings of patch-based methods, such as

*Wangbo Zhao,Yizeng Han,Zhiwei Tang,Jiasheng Tang,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Bohan Zhuang,Zhangyang Wang,Fan Wang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需训练即可加速扩散变换器采样的框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现图像级别的自适应加速，在保持生成质量的同时实现近3倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散变换器加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略导致质量损失，要么需要高成本的微调，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出三个独立的策略头（步长跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力），通过组相对策略优化在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号。

Result: 在包括Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX在内的先进DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍的采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3框架成功实现了零基础生成器更新的图像级别自适应加速，为扩散变换器的实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The
source code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: CircuitSense是一个评估多模态大语言模型在电路理解方面能力的综合基准，包含8000多个问题，涵盖从组件级原理图到系统级框图的完整工程工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但它们在从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。工程设计需要通过层次化抽象从系统规范到组件实现，这需要视觉理解与数学推理的结合。

Method: 提出了一个层次化合成生成管道，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和具有自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。对六个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 闭源模型在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理方面的性能低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路合成中具有基础性作用，符号推理是衡量工程能力的关键指标。多模态大语言模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Conclusion: HierLight-YOLO在无人机小目标检测任务中实现了精度和效率的良好平衡，为资源受限平台上的实时小目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

confidence levels; (4) a comprehensive performance analysis of the model across
multiple heterogeneous datasets Gossipcop, Politifact, Fakeddit, MMFakeBench,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡是当前视觉模型在解释复杂密集真实世界图像和场景时面临的主要挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 通过向GPT-4提供专门设计的提示和输入图像，让其分析图像并生成顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Result: 在COCOA和InstaOrder数据集上的评估显示，该模型利用语义上下文、视觉模式和常识知识能产生更准确的顺序预测。

Conclusion: 与基线方法不同，该模型能以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于显著边界增强的多焦点图像融合方法，通过梯度域模型和Tenengrad梯度检测生成高质量融合边界，在四个公开数据集上优于12种现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法难以保持清晰的焦点-散焦边界，常导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量来精炼边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于显著边界增强的多焦点图像融合方法能够有效生成高质量融合边界，提升融合图像质量。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，通过聚类训练代理模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略，在动态输出和静态输出场景中都取得了显著攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出场景（输出标签数量和空间不固定），需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 采用基于聚类的代理模型训练方法，将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景；提出最远标签目标攻击策略，选择偏离模型粗粒度标签最远的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%；在传统静态输出场景中最大ASR达82.68%；在生成式设置中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法能有效攻击动态输出场景，在有限访问条件下具有破坏大语言模型的潜力，同时在静态和生成式场景中也表现出色。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像分割系统仍有改进空间，通过将医学背景知识整合到分割模型的损失函数中可以提升性能

Method: 使用逻辑张量网络(LTNs)将医学知识编码为一阶逻辑规则，与SwinUNETR分割网络结合形成端到端框架，规则涵盖分割形状约束和分割区域间关系

Result: 实验显示LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更明显

Conclusion: 尽管处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有的概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型，无法适用于视觉自回归模型，因为VAR采用下一尺度token预测范式，存在安全担忧。

Method: VARE框架利用辅助视觉token降低微调强度；S-VARE方法结合过滤交叉熵损失精确识别和最小调整不安全视觉token，以及保持损失来维护语义保真度。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法实现了精确的概念擦除，同时保持了生成质量，解决了朴素微调带来的语言漂移和多样性降低问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全空白，为VAR模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Motivation: 医学影像中的解剖理解对于自动报告生成、术中导航和器官定位至关重要，但受限于专家标注数据的稀缺性。利用标注参考图像指导未标注目标的解释是可行的解决方案。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的精细分割能力相结合，实现小解剖区域的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于使用相同内存设置的SAM2微调基准，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的研究，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中解剖理解的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 提出FreqDebias框架解决深度伪造检测器中的频谱偏差问题，通过Fo-Mixup增强和双一致性正则化提升跨域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器因从有限训练数据中学习到偏差而难以泛化到新的伪造类型，特别是频谱域中的模型偏差

Method: 使用Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特性，并结合基于CAM的局部一致性和基于vMF分布的全局一致性双正则化

Result: FreqDebias显著提升了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过缓解频谱偏差有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过适配大型扩散变换器Flux.1，引入轻量级双分支调节器来注入退化输入和轻度修复代理的信号，实现几何锚定和伪影抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用图像修复中判别性修复器和UNet扩散先验在未知混合退化条件下容易产生过度平滑、幻觉或漂移的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级双分支调节器注入退化输入和轻度修复代理信号；设计时间步和层级自适应调制调度；通过SigLIP特征实现无描述语义对齐；采用可扩展筛选流程获取结构丰富的监督数据。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux始终优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过多尺度解释聚合和激活排名相关来解决视觉和文本模态中的内部依赖问题，生成更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内部依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块的归因忽略了空间上下文，导致解释碎片化；文本模态中依赖前文标记会引入虚假激活。这些干扰影响了归因的保真度。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 视觉分支的多尺度解释聚合(MSEA)，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；2) 文本分支的激活排名相关(ARC)，通过前k个预测排名的对齐来测量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个最先进的多模态大语言模型和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在可解释性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内部交互，提出的方法能够生成更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释，有效解决了现有可解释性方法中的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

### [135] [Vision-Language Alignment from Compressed Image Representations using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22615)
*Yasmine Omri,Connor Ding,Tsachy Weissman,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，相比传统RGB像素具有更高的传输效率和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器在边缘设备到云端传输时的两个结构性问题：(i)密集RGB图像传输能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于patch的tokenization导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力计算负担。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级splat感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，将对比语言图像预训练(CLIP)适配到2DGS表示上。

Result: 实现了超过90倍的拟合加速和约97%的GPU利用率；在DataComp数据集上，GS编码器在压缩输入3-20倍的同时，仍能获得有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，虽然当前精度仍落后于RGB编码器，但为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘-云端学习表示开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了U-MAN网络，通过渐进注意力引导特征融合和多尺度自适应KAN模块，解决了医学图像分割中细节丢失和边界模糊的问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距，以及缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中细粒度细节和精确边界难以保持。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在BUSI、GLAS和CVC三个公开数据集上的实验表明，U-MAN在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合注意力机制和多尺度自适应处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的关键挑战，在边界精度和细节保留方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用预处理数据，但这些预处理往往针对人类感知设计，对于自动化分析可能不是最优的。在低带宽和能耗受限环境下，高比特ADC数据在传输效率上表现不佳，显著影响可穿戴设备的电池寿命。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，即针对特定任务学习非线性量化。该方法应用于原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备的人体活动识别任务，通过学习可训练的量化函数来优化低比特深度数据的使用。

Result: 实验表明，使用可学习量化的原始数据，仅需4位量化即可在性能上与12位原始数据相当，显著降低了数据传输需求。

Conclusion: γ-Quant方法证明了在低比特深度设置下，通过学习任务特定的非线性量化，可以保持模式识别性能的同时显著降低数据传输需求，为低功耗设备提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多模态大语言模型驱动的中央编排器，执行三个核心能力：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注，有效解决高质量领域特定数据集构建的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量领域特定数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型驱动的中央编排器进行多步推理，执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票的新颖共识机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在密集COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选提议，几乎是7.4个真实对象的两倍，最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现了903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展到1500多个类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，主动学习策略比替代方案计算效率高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为策展工业规模数据集提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督训练框架SSVIF，用于分割导向的可见光-红外图像融合方法，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VIF方法仅关注融合图像质量，应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割与像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，采用两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF优于传统VIF方法，与有监督的分割导向方法相当，尽管仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对进行训练。

Conclusion: SSVIF框架有效解决了应用导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，在无监督情况下实现了与有监督方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型快速发展，但人类是否能检测生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要研究人类感知的时空伪影痕迹。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域定位和精确时间戳。训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型来模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在DeeptraceReward上平均比GPT-5表现好34.7%。发现一致的难度梯度：二元真假分类比细粒度深度伪造痕迹检测容易；在后者中，从自然语言解释到空间定位再到时间标注性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信赖的视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架有效解决了医学影像跨域适应问题，通过风格迁移和扩散模型的结合实现了高质量的图像生成和分割性能提升

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

TL;DR: 提出CapRL框架，使用强化学习替代监督微调进行图像描述生成，通过非视觉语言模型基于描述回答问题的准确性作为奖励信号，解决了图像描述任务中主观质量评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型容易记忆特定答案，缺乏泛化能力和多样性。需要一种不依赖人工标注的替代方法。

Method: CapRL采用解耦的两阶段流程：LVLM生成图像描述，然后基于该描述让无视觉的LLM回答多选题，根据回答准确率计算客观奖励。这是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升。在Prism框架评估中，性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，比基线平均提高8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL成功将强化学习应用于主观的图像描述任务，通过基于效用的质量定义解决了奖励设计难题，为图像描述生成提供了新的训练范式。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择来消除事件数据中的时空冗余，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧的方法忽略了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大。现有RGB视频的令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化（基于时空一致性去除噪声和非事件区域）和时间令牌选择（评估相邻事件帧运动模式相似性去除冗余时间信息）。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上，PSTTS将FLOPs减少29-43.6%，FPS提升21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS利用事件数据的时空分布特性有效识别和丢弃冗余令牌，实现了精度和效率的最佳平衡，是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行均匀优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献存在差异，需要识别关键token并实施有效的token级优化。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖、熵诱导的空间结构、RLVR聚焦的token多样性，并引入动态token级优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的token就能超越全token优化的GRPO方法，证明了其在AR视觉生成中的有效性。

Conclusion: GCPO通过聚焦关键token进行策略优化，显著提高了RLVR在自回归视觉生成中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，随着视觉语言模型的普及，了解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典颜色命名方法，进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: 模型在原型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非原型颜色集上表现显著下降；发现21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语；语言模型架构显著影响颜色命名。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面存在局限性，特别是在非原型颜色和跨语言场景中，语言模型架构对颜色命名有独立影响。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

*Andrii Litvynchuk,Ivan Livinsky,Anand Ravi,Nima Kalantari,Andrii Tsarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EfficientDepth系统，结合transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，通过双模态密度头和LPIPS损失函数实现高效的单目深度估计，在保持几何一致性和细节的同时大幅降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在几何一致性、细节保留、对反射表面等现实挑战的鲁棒性以及边缘设备效率方面存在不足，需要开发既能满足3D重建和视图合成要求又高效的系统。

Method: 结合transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，使用双模态密度头估计详细深度图；在合成和真实图像混合数据集上训练，采用多阶段优化策略；引入基于LPIPS的损失函数增强细节保留。

Result: 实验结果表明EfficientDepth在性能上达到或超过现有最先进模型，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: EfficientDepth系统成功解决了单目深度估计中的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时实现了计算效率，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于类别发现(CD)的综述性研究，系统回顾了从已标记类别中自动发现未标记数据中新类别的开放世界学习方法，提出了分类体系并分析了不同设置下的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，用于复杂视频异常检测，结合自监督学习的时间分析和LLM的语义验证，在ComplexVAD数据集上取得72.5%的帧级AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂异常检测的挑战，这类异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。SSL方法难以理解交互语义，而LLM计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: 提出HyCoVAD混合模型：1）基于nnFormer的多任务SSL时序分析器识别可疑帧；2）LLM验证器通过结构化规则推理进行语义验证。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD有效结合SSL和LLM优势，在复杂异常检测中表现出色，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一种新型视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了传统方法中空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），导致空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀，阻碍高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: 扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的token KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN优于20多种最新方法，达到SOTA性能。相比使用多种数据类型输入的方法，成功率提升10.5-35.5；相比使用更多RGB训练数据的方法，成功率提升3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

### [151] [SpikeMatch: Semi-Supervised Learning with Temporal Dynamics of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22581)
*Jini Yang,Beomseok Oh,Seungryong Kim,Sunok Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络的半监督学习框架，利用SNN的时序动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在有限标签下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络因其生物合理性和能效优势受到关注，但与人工神经网络相比，SNN的半监督学习方法研究不足，需要开发专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: 提出SpikeMatch框架，利用SNN泄漏因子的时序动态特性，在协同训练框架内进行多样化伪标签生成。通过单个SNN的多次预测一致性，从弱增强的无标签样本生成可靠伪标签，用于训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明，SpikeMatch在多个标准基准测试中优于现有适应到SNN骨干网络的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功利用SNN的时序动态特性，有效缓解确认偏差，在有限标签条件下捕获判别性特征，为SNN半监督学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇聚等关键技术，在保持高质量的同时实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和交互性方面的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力模型在长视频上质量下降，且需要支持实时交互式提示输入。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制、流式长调优训练、短窗口注意力与帧级注意力汇聚技术。

Result: 仅用32 GPU天将1.3B参数短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单H100 GPU上达到20.7 FPS，支持240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LongLive框架在效率、质量和交互性方面实现了突破，为实时长视频生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK框架通过协同演化策略和奖励模型，利用RLVR的废弃数据训练生成式奖励模型，无需独立奖励模型或人类偏好数据，实现高效稳定的强化学习后训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信号的问题，通过回收利用废弃数据来同时训练模型和奖励模型。

Method: 基于RLVR框架，回收丢弃的rollouts和正确性数据，使用点对奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等混合目标，训练模型作为生成式奖励模型。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，如SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，在2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，在8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过策略和奖励模型的协同演化，实现了无需外部奖励模型的高效强化学习，展示了鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCNeXt的新型自监督深度估计架构，结合现代CNN特征提取器和创新的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时超越了现有CNN和ViT模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些应用通常受计算能力限制。由于在不同场景中获取可靠的真实深度数据困难，当有大量未标记数据集可用时，自监督技术成为解决方案。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真实数据和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在自监督深度估计中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT提出了一种基于统一建模语言的结构化推理框架，通过UML类图和活动图生成符号化的思维链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清理任务中优于非结构化CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性受限。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化的顺序或条件规划语义。

Method: 使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流水线，结合监督微调和GRPO，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中标记数据有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案、类相似性采样策略，无需模型微调或外部工具。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或相当的性能，特别在细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 双图像提示与正负引导相结合能有效生成类判别特征，为少样本分类提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 探索视觉自回归生成(VAR)与扩散模型之间的理论联系，利用扩散模型的优势来改进VAR的效率与性能。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，将VAR重新解释为离散扩散过程，引入迭代精炼机制并减少架构低效性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的推理成本和改进的零样本重建能力，在效率和生成质量方面获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 扩散模型视角为VAR带来了显著优势，建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，为视觉生成提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HERMAN方法，通过利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，实现精确区分并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的类增量学习方法使用简单模板（如"一张[类别]的照片"），忽略了视觉概念的层次性。区分不同类别需要不同粒度的线索，而CLIP当前仅使用最后一层特征，忽视了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，增强语义空间的层次提示。这些描述符与语义层次的不同级别匹配，并根据任务需求自适应路由，实现精确区分。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差分特征学习机制，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，仅需1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块进行自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制，通过计算并行编码器对相同输入学习互补表征的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval的问答、对话和摘要数据集上实验表明，幻觉信号集中在稀疏特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上取得显著准确率提升，发现浅层特征多样性高而深层使用集中的漏斗模式。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可在保持准确率的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [161] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Contextual Influence Value (CI值)作为上下文质量评估新指标，通过测量移除每个上下文时的性能下降来量化质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索到低质量上下文（包含无关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量指标的上下文选择方法未能充分利用查询、上下文列表和生成器的综合信息。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新概念化为推理时数据估值问题，引入CI值指标；开发参数化代理模型预测CI值，采用分层架构捕捉局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互，通过oracle CI值监督和端到端生成器反馈进行训练。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值提供了一种全面评估上下文质量的新方法，通过整合查询感知相关性、列表感知独特性和生成器感知对齐，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at

*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，大多数模型在1000个token内就会出现严重性能下降，实际有效窗口最多比宣传值低99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试语言模型在实际使用中的上下文窗口有效性，揭示宣传的最大上下文窗口与实际有效窗口之间的差距。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法，收集了数十万个数据点，比较了不同模型在各种问题类型下的表现。

Result: 发现最大有效上下文窗口不仅与宣传的最大上下文窗口差异巨大，而且随问题类型变化。顶级模型在100个token时就会失败，大多数模型在1000个token时准确率严重下降。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的改进方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在多语言环境中的道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题，揭示了预训练数据对模型道德指南针的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多语言和多文化环境中部署，需要评估其在多样化语言和文化背景下进行道德推理的能力，特别是考虑到主流预训练数据主要基于英语。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心构建的研究问题分析差异根源。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言中的道德判断存在显著不一致性，往往反映文化错位，并识别出从分歧到推理策略的潜在驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提炼出道德推理错误的结构化类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中表现出色，能与ADA标准高度一致，为临床医生和患者提供双重支持工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难，症状模糊，实验室值边界模糊，妊娠期复杂，长期监测需求高。大语言模型（LLMs）提供了通过结构化、可解释和患者友好的输出来增强决策支持的机会。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架评估GPT-5，这些病例与ADA 2025护理标准对齐，并受NHANES、Pima Indians、EyePACS和MIMIC-IV等公共数据集的启发。测试了五个代表性场景：症状识别、实验室解释、妊娠期糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测。

Result: 结果显示与ADA定义的标准高度一致，表明GPT-5可能作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具。

Conclusion: GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中表现出潜力，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗保健中LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在减轻性别刻板印象时，公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面的局限性，发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动，选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘，且通用的缓解遗忘方法无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能权衡的底层机制，特别是在减轻性别刻板印象的背景下，通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角来分析当前方法的局限性。

Method: 通过分析遗忘机制和公平性目标，研究选择性遗忘刻板印象对整体遗忘水平和下游任务性能的影响。

Result: 发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；通用的缓解遗忘方法无法减少整体遗忘，也无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要更有效的方法来平衡道德对齐和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Motivation: 开发能够整合组织特定知识的定制推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的场景下

Method: 采用简单通用的训练方法：精心设计提示和模型选择，使用离线强化学习方法TAO进行预热，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，首次提交就达到私有测试集73.56%的准确率（无自一致性）和75.68%（有自一致性），且需要更少的生成次数

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编程

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [168] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）中使用混合token生成（MoT-G）方法，通过保留模型概率分布信息来提升语言模型推理能力，相比标准解码方法在推理任务上获得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散token，丢弃了模型在候选token上的丰富概率分布信息，这限制了推理搜索空间。研究表明在非RL环境中保留这种分布信息是有益的，因此需要探索如何在RLVR中利用这一信息。

Method: 提出了混合token生成（MoT-G）的统一框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中生成思维链。包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和，以及直接在连续混合空间中操作的方法。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上评估，MoT-G方法相比标准解码在7/10任务上获得5-35%的显著提升，同时用一半的轨迹数量达到可比精度，表明训练效率提高。

Conclusion: MoT-G的优势可能源于其在推理过程中保持更高隐藏状态熵的能力，并促进token空间的探索。该方法为RLVR提供了更有效的推理搜索策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提高分类准确率的同时显著降低推理吞吐量的问题。

Method: 在解码器语言模型中添加池化分类头和推理头，训练时使用标签交叉熵和token级语言模型损失的加权和，推理时禁用推理头。

Result: 在7个SuperGLUE任务上相对基线提升0.65-5.47%，推理吞吐量比CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法有效解决了CoT的精度-吞吐量权衡，实现了高精度和高效率的推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码中哪些特性对提升大型语言模型推理能力最为关键，目前尚不清楚代码的结构、语义等不同方面各自的作用。

Method: 构建10种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在5个模型家族、8种规模的LLM上进行3,331次实验。

Result: LLM对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感；伪代码和流程图等抽象表示与真实代码效果相当；即使代码被破坏但保留表面规律仍能保持竞争力；不同编程语言对特定任务有不同优势。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是提升LLM推理能力的关键因素，合适的抽象表示可以替代真实代码，这为设计训练数据以增强LLM推理能力提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 研究非洲口音英语说话人日志在不同领域（特别是临床对话）中的表现差异，探索领域适应方法来解决临床对话中的性能下降问题。

Method: 评估多个生产和开源系统在一般和临床对话上的表现，使用严格的DER协议评分重叠；通过微调分割模块进行轻量级领域适应；进行错误分析和对话级剖析。

Result: 临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，错误主要由误报和漏检造成；领域适应能减少错误但无法消除领域差距。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: 提出了ComPSum个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好生成结构化分析来指导个性化摘要生成，并构建了PerMSum数据集和AuthorMap评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要识别用户偏好的细粒度差异，通过比较不同用户的偏好来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum框架：首先通过比较用户偏好生成结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导个性化摘要生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好生成结构化分析的方法能有效提升个性化多文档摘要的质量。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，用于一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化，在真实多视角低质量图像规划任务中显著优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长视野规划任务中表现不足。文本领域通过将规划问题转化为PDDL形式语言取得了显著进展，但多模态环境中的VLM作为形式化器研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，支持一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准上评估，并提出了两个新基准，首次考虑真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划任务。

Result: VLM作为形式化器在规划任务中大幅优于端到端规划生成方法。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，因为VLM经常无法捕捉到必要的完整对象关系集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）能部分提升性能，但增益不一致。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器在多模态规划中具有显著优势，但视觉能力仍是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示能提供部分改进，但性能提升不一致，为未来多模态规划形式化研究留下了发展空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译英语习语和双关语等比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管模型在语法准确性上表现良好，但在文化适应性方面仍有明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量这些对实际应用至关重要的因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电商营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由精通目标语言的人工评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型通常能产生语法正确的翻译，但在文化细微语言方面表现不佳，经常需要大量人工修正。即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 挑战了数据量是机器翻译质量最可靠预测因子的假设，提出文化适应性是多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，这是当前学术和行业基准中未充分探索的领域。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来解决长上下文生成中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法使用静态离线学习的子空间，在数据分布变化时性能较差，无法适应动态上下文变化。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留关键的首尾token作为锚点，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的极长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，与FlashAttention等现代注意力模块完全兼容。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个无需模型微调的即插即用解决方案，为内存高效的长上下文推理提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在关键领域应用中带来了可解释性挑战，现有XAI方法在应用于语言模型时存在局限性，且缺乏针对不同架构的系统性分析。

Method: 按Transformer架构类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）组织XAI技术，分析每种架构下方法的适应性和优缺点，并通过合理性和忠实性双重标准评估效果。

Result: 提供了针对不同语言模型架构的XAI技术系统性分类和评估框架，揭示了各类方法在不同架构下的适用性和局限性。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战，并提出了未来发展方向，旨在推动开发更稳健、透明和可解释的语言模型XAI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠的方法来检测低质量评审中的错误信息。

Method: 定义错误信息评审点，构建专家标注数据集，提出自动化引擎重构弱点中的前提，使用8个最先进LLMs评估ReviewScore。

Result: 15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题包含错误信息，LLMs在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估一致性更高。

Conclusion: 自动化ReviewScore评估具有潜力，前提级事实性评估是更可靠的方法，为提升同行评审质量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Conclusion: GRAB基准为金融披露主题模型提供了可复现、标准化的比较框架，促进了该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Risk categorization in 10-K risk disclosures matters for oversight and
investment, yet no public benchmark evaluates unsupervised topic models for
this task. We present GRAB, a finance-specific benchmark with 1.61M sentences
from 8,247 filings and span-grounded sentence labels produced without manual
annotation by combining FinBERT token attention, YAKE keyphrase signals, and
taxonomy-aware collocation matching. Labels are anchored in a risk taxonomy
mapping 193 terms to 21 fine-grained types nested under five macro classes; the
21 types guide weak supervision, while evaluation is reported at the macro
level. GRAB unifies evaluation with fixed dataset splits and robust
metrics--Accuracy, Macro-F1, Topic BERTScore, and the entropy-based Effective
Number of Topics. The dataset, labels, and code enable reproducible,

Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临基本权衡：手动构建知识图谱成本高昂，自动提取的图谱受限于底层LLM提取器的性能，特别是使用小型本地部署模型时。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（构造器、检索器、反射器、响应器），通过演化查询和演化子图双重演化机制，在推理过程中自适应构建目标图索引。

Result: 广泛实验表明ToG-3在深度和广度推理基准测试中优于基线方法，消融研究确认了MACER框架组件的有效性。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双重演化多智能体系统，克服了传统图RAG方法中静态一次性图构建的固有缺陷，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Speculative Biased Decoding方法，用于流式应用中的同时翻译，通过重用最近输出作为草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，实现1.7倍加速和80%闪烁减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中难以直接使用的问题，需要持续更新输出同时控制计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 使用最近输出作为草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用方案。

Result: 在同时文本到文本重翻译任务中，相比传统自回归重翻译实现1.7倍加速，质量不下降，结合display-only mask-k技术显著减少80%闪烁。

Conclusion: 提出的自推测偏置解码方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了有效的加速解决方案，无需额外草稿计算，显著改善用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景中的音频推理任务表现受限，缺乏噪声抑制、声源分离等音频工具的支持。

Method: 提出Thinking-with-Sound框架，通过音频思维链将语言推理与实时音频域分析相结合，使模型能够主动对音频信号进行数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升模型鲁棒性：小模型准确率提升24.73%，大模型提升36.61%，而现有模型在扰动音频上准确率下降超过50%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链无需重新训练即可显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更稳健的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing

TL;DR: SynerGen是一个统一的生成式推荐模型，通过单一生成骨干网络同时处理个性化搜索和推荐任务，在检索和排序任务上都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统检索-排序管道中的校准问题和工程开销，以及现有生成模型在统一个性化搜索和推荐时存在的性能权衡问题。

Method: 使用基于行为序列训练的仅解码器Transformer，结合InfoNCE检索损失和混合点对-配对排序损失的联合优化，并提出时间感知旋转位置嵌入。

Result: 在广泛采用的推荐和搜索基准测试中，相比强大的生成式推荐器和联合搜索推荐基线，取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示混合结果，但因果分析表明在大多数情况下结构化输出没有因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不足和依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，并在七个公开任务和一个开发推理任务上应用因果推断分析。

Result: 在48个场景中，43个显示结构化输出没有因果影响；在剩余5个中，3个涉及由具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。

Conclusion: 粗粒度指标可能误导对结构化输出影响的评估，因果分析揭示了更细微的真实影响模式。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出了Think-as-Locals方法来改进文化感知奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估，需要填补文化相关评估数据集的空白，以推进LLMs的全球对齐。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域；提出Think-as-Locals方法，通过RLVR激发生成式奖励模型的文化推理能力。

Result: 评估显示最先进奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在不足；CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关；Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准能有效评估奖励模型文化意识；Think-as-Locals方法能提升文化感知奖励建模能力，促进LLMs的全球文化对齐。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，在LLM框架中引入四种自适应动作来改善翻译质量和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分解决同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下的高质量翻译需求。

Method: 在仅解码器的LLM框架中实现四种自适应动作：句子切分、删除、部分摘要和代词化，并通过动作感知提示构建训练参考。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该方法在语义指标（如COMET-KIWI）上持续改进，并实现了比参考翻译和基于salami的基线更低的延迟。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人机翻译差距提供了有前景的方向，其中删除和句子切分组合在流畅性和延迟之间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈解决传统多模态学习中的数据集偏见问题，提升分布外泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的多模态学习方法容易受到数据集偏见影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务及分布外测试集上的广泛实验证明了CaMIB的有效性

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果原则而非传统似然方法，有效缓解了数据集偏见问题，具有良好解释性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: 语言谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅能促进语言学发展，还能支持关于稀有语言知识的传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

TL;DR: 提出了ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，解决工具使用任务中策略梯度方差大、训练效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在优化LLM工具使用策略时，仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，未考虑工具使用任务的特殊性，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低下。

Method: ResT通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑过渡。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中达到最先进水平，比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，在单轮任务上超越GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超越1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT方法通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，有效稳定了多轮工具使用任务的收敛，显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语义一致性的级联系统，通过检测模型输出的语义共识来判断可靠性，实现成本降低40%、延迟减少60%的高效LLM部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统面临在开放文本生成中判断输出可靠性的挑战，因为生成质量是连续谱且存在多个有效响应。

Method: 使用语义一致性作为训练无关的延迟信号，当不同模型输出在语义层面达成共识时，将其作为比token级置信度更强的可靠性指标。

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上评估，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低达60%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为现实世界LLM部署提供了实用基准。

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在核心权衡，需要解决这一矛盾。

Conclusion: 结构化分解是创建更强大和可解释共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专门评估多轮长问答（MT-LFQA）的基准KnowMT-Bench，发现在多轮对话中LLMs的事实准确性和信息效率会下降，而检索增强生成（RAG）可以有效缓解这种退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，缺乏对知识密集型领域多轮长问答的系统评估，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 构建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置让模型基于逻辑递进的问题序列生成多轮对话历史，使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 多轮上下文会降低性能：事实能力因自生成历史中的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而降低（模型变得更啰嗦）。RAG可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLMs在真实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要一种非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN持续优于QLoRA，消融研究显示Sinter优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确且充分的上下文，仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比先前方法提升高达+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下仍保持鲁棒性，提供了有效性和实用性的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注不同正确性的响应，而忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，这些提示实际上能提供有价值的反馈。

Method: RL-ZVP算法直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误，通过token级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61分，通过率提升7.77分，且持续优于过滤零方差提示的基线方法。

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未开发的潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这些提示中学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

TL;DR: QoNext是首个将网络和多媒体领域的体验质量(QoE)原则应用于基础模型评估的框架，通过识别体验因素并构建预测模型来评估用户交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽略了用户交互体验的重要性，无法捕捉用户满意度的真正机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的体验因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型。

Result: QoNext不仅实现了主动和细粒度的评估，还为产品化服务提供了优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext框架成功将QoE原则引入基础模型评估，能够更好地理解和预测用户交互体验。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数量k，直觉上推理时激活更多专家(k'>k)应该提升性能，但实际发现性能会快速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习到的协作。

Method: 提出EMoE训练框架，通过同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，使MoE模型能在推理时扩展激活专家数量而无需额外训练开销。

$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

*Kemal Sami Karaca,Bahaeddin Eravcı*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引文意图分类问题，提出了一个系统化方法，包括创建新的土耳其语引文意图数据集、使用DSPy框架自动化提示优化，以及通过堆叠泛化集成方法实现91.3%的最先进准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解引文的定性意图对于学术研究评估至关重要，但土耳其语等黏着性语言在此任务上面临独特挑战，需要专门的数据集和分类方法。

Method: 首先创建了公开可用的土耳其语引文意图数据集，然后使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道来自动化提示优化，最后采用堆叠泛化集成方法（XGBoost元模型）聚合多个优化模型的输出。

Result: 提出的集成方法达到了91.3%的最先进准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法，解决了手动设计提示导致的不一致性问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和稳健的分类框架，为未来的定性引文研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [203] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分性能，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在自动评分任务中面临的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题，为教育评估实践提供可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用双智能体设计：评分标准组件提取智能体从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分智能体基于该表示分配最终分数，模拟人类评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上，AutoSCORE相比单智能体基线在评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE）方面持续提升，特别是在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多智能体设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂评分场景。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出SimulSense框架，模仿人类口译员在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策，实现同步语音翻译的优质延迟权衡和实时效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同步语音翻译系统需要专门的交错训练数据和计算昂贵的大语言模型推理，无法像人类口译员那样自然地进行读写决策。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译，模仿人类口译员的工作方式。

Result: 与两个最先进的基线系统相比，该方法实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架能够有效模仿人类口译员的读写决策模式，在保持翻译质量的同时显著提升实时效率。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了思维链(CoT)提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现在95个先进LLM和87个真实临床任务中，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下性能下降，揭示了临床领域CoT的可靠性悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床护理中的应用日益增多，需要准确性和透明推理。虽然CoT在其他领域提升了性能和可解释性，但在临床电子健康记录(EHR)这种长文本、碎片化、噪声多的场景中效果尚不明确。

Method: 在87个真实临床文本任务上评估95个先进LLM，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型。通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误模式，结合LLM-as-a-judge和临床专家评估。

Result: 86.3%的模型在CoT设置下性能下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型显著下降。CoT增强了可解释性但可能损害临床文本任务的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了临床背景下CoT失败的系统模式，强调了在临床LLM推理策略中需要透明和可信方法的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，通过反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来减轻泰语政治立场检测中的偏见，无需微调即可提高公平性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在泰语政治环境中，大语言模型存在系统性偏见，如情感泄漏和实体偏袒，影响公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督，分离情感与立场，减少偏见；发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集。

Result: ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，提高了多个LLM的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，结合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来增强LLM的学术构思能力，解决基础不足和确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术构思方面潜力巨大，但面临基础不足和确认偏误的关键挑战，需要改进构思质量和严谨性。

Method: 集成动机知识图谱（存储问题、挑战和解决方案节点）和双代理苏格拉底提问系统，通过结构化基础知识和严谨的提问过程来改进构思。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在LLM评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话有效提升了LLM构思的基础性、新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLM内部状态，但在黑盒API受限场景下难以应用，急需建立有效的黑盒检测方法

Method: 通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答具有一致性，而非事实性回答不一致，据此提出黑盒检测指标

Result: 实验表明该指标比使用LLM内部知识的基线方法更能预测模型回答的事实性

Conclusion: 基于不确定性表达的黑盒检测方法能有效识别LLMs的幻觉问题，为受限API环境提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch提出了一种新颖的代理深度搜索工作流，通过双通道检索策略解决现有GraphRAG方法中浅层检索和结构图数据利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法发现所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据的低效利用，这阻碍了从复杂查询中进行有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用模块化框架组织检索过程，包含六个模块，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。采用双通道检索策略，在基于块的文本数据上执行语义查询，在结构图数据上执行关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模通常将异常值视为噪声而忽略，但本研究认为这些异常值可能包含新兴主题的早期信号，特别是在动态新闻语料中。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语的新闻数据集上追踪异常值随时间的演化，重点关注企业社会责任和气候变化主题。

Result: 结果显示了一个一致的模式：异常值倾向于随时间演化成连贯的主题，这一发现在不同模型和语言中都得到了验证。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单地视为噪声，而是可以作为检测新兴主题的重要弱信号，这对动态文本分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative
clustering approach, we track their evolution over time in French and English
news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent
topics over time across both models and languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床聊天机器人应用中安全至关重要，现有方法（如护栏和工具调用）往往无法满足临床领域的细微需求，需要更全面的安全框架。

Method: 开发了TACOS分类法，整合安全过滤和工具选择，明确建模不同的安全阈值和外部工具依赖关系，并创建了TACOS标注数据集进行验证。

Result: 实验结果表明专门针对临床代理设置的新分类法具有价值，并揭示了训练数据分布和基础模型预训练知识的有用见解。

Conclusion: TACOS框架为临床聊天机器人提供了更全面的安全保障，通过单一分类步骤同时处理安全过滤和工具选择需求。

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义性或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入模糊推理链（FRC）框架，整合LLM语义先验与连续模糊隶属度，在概率推理和模糊隶属推理之间建立显式交互，逐步将模糊输入转化为清晰可解释的决策。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理，并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态的AIGT检测，而社交媒体内容受用户参与度驱动且随时间演变，需要研究其动态特性。

Method: 构建了首个5年纵向社交媒体数据集RedNote-Vibe，并提出基于心理语言学特征的PLAD可解释检测框架。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了人类与AI生成内容的区别特征，以及这些语言特征与社交媒体参与度的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交媒体AIGT的时序动态分析提供了重要数据集和检测方法，有助于理解AI生成内容在社交平台上的演变规律。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

*Anya Belz,Simon Mille,Craig Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET评估质量标准分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致导致评估结果不可比的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域存在数百种质量标准名称，相同名称可能评估不同质量方面，导致独立评估结果无法可靠比较，阻碍领域科学进展。

Method: 采用描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准质量标准名称和定义，并将其组织成层次结构，父节点捕捉子节点的共同方面。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，可用于建立现有评估的可比性、指导新评估设计以及评估监管合规性。

Conclusion: QCET为解决NLP评估可比性问题提供了标准化框架，有助于提升领域评估的一致性和科学性。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观点，指出失败源于深度优先的编辑流程，而非微调本身。通过恢复广度优先的微调流程和优化调参位置，提出了LocFT-BF方法，在多个LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为微调在模型编辑中效果不佳，但作者认为这种失败源于不合适的编辑流程（深度优先、逐样本优化），而非微调本身的内在限制。

Method: 1) 将微调恢复为标准广度优先（基于epoch）流程，使用小批量优化；2) 系统分析调参位置，提出LocFT-BF方法，在恢复的微调框架上构建局部化编辑策略。

Result: LocFT-BF在多个LLM和数据集上大幅超越最先进方法，首次实现了10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的持续编辑，且不损害通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入原则性的局部调优策略，将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading

*Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Denis Makhov,Magauiya Zhussip,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知优化实现更好的模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 使用密集字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏分解，通过校准数据集优化分解以最小化功能重构误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，在Llama和Qwen模型上均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，精度和困惑度表现更优。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本(DAS)框架，通过结构化对话行为表示生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的问题，提高对话的文化相关性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常依赖英语对话的翻译，这会引入人工痕迹，降低对话的自然性和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用对话行为脚本(DAS)框架，从抽象意图表示中编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，而不是直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面始终优于机器和人工翻译的对话。

Conclusion: DAS框架通过结构化对话行为表示支持跨语言的灵活本地化，减轻翻译腔问题，实现更流畅、自然的对话生成。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成奖励模型中的解决-判断差距问题，通过同时利用模型的解决和判断能力进行监督，显著提升了判断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现生成奖励模型存在显著的解决-判断差距，即模型能够解决问题但无法正确判断的情况（14%-37%），这影响了模型的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM输出上同时利用解决和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中明确连接问题解决和评估能力。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的解决-判断差距，将模型判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用更小训练数据集的情况下达到了同基础模型GRM中的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自我进化而不依赖更强大的外部模型蒸馏，成功缩小了生成奖励模型中的解决-判断差距，提升了判断性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于验证复杂数值声明的增强方法，通过扩展测试时计算（TTS）来生成多个推理路径，并训练验证器模型选择最佳路径，同时引入自适应机制提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在验证需要组合性和数值推理的真实世界声明时存在不足，无法理解数值方面的细微差别，且容易发生推理漂移问题。

Method: 系统性地探索测试时计算扩展，从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型VERIFIERFC来选择可能导向正确结论的路径，并引入自适应机制根据声明复杂度选择性执行TTS。

Result: TTS有助于缓解推理漂移问题，显著提高了数值声明验证的性能。自适应方法比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，比单次验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 通过测试时计算扩展和验证器模型可以显著改善复杂数值声明的验证性能，同时自适应机制有效平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测问题，在多司法管辖区数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测性任务中表现不佳，且大多数方法局限于特定司法管辖区缺乏普适性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP框架，通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论推理来精炼最终预测。

Result: 在多司法管辖区数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势，有效解决了法律条文预测中的挑战，在多司法管辖区展现出良好的性能和普适性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Motivation: 研究多语言视觉语言模型在处理跨语言文本和图像时的表现，探索当前模型在语言中立性与文化适应性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 系统回顾了31个模型和21个基准测试，涵盖编码器架构和生成式架构，分析训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习偏向语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据；三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，近期工作开始纳入文化相关内容；存在跨语言能力差异以及训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言模型需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间找到更好的平衡，当前存在训练方法与评估目标不一致的问题。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域开发高性能模型。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景对模型进行微调，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到FoodOn、SNOMED-CT和Hansard分类法等本体。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文的主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品标注语料库、发布用于推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在标记，在保持准确性的同时提高效率，平衡了显式推理的透明度和潜在推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示方法在大型语言模型中存在的延迟高、内存使用大以及早期错误传播的问题，寻求在推理效率和透明度之间取得平衡。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式。使用双重目标：主任务损失和辅助计划重构损失。

Result: 在保持或提高复杂基准测试准确性的同时，显著减少了推理过程中的可见标记数量，实现了效率、准确性和可解释性的平衡。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架成功地在推理效率和透明度之间找到了平衡点，通过压缩推理计划为潜在表示，在减少计算开销的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

TL;DR: GTO通过引入草稿树奖励和基于组的草稿策略训练，解决了推测解码中训练与推理策略不匹配的问题，显著提高了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码训练目标只优化单个贪婪草稿路径，而推理时使用树策略验证多个分支，这种策略不匹配限制了可实现的加速效果。

Method: 提出GTO方法，包含两个组件：(1)草稿树奖励-采样自由的目标函数，等于目标模型下草稿树的期望接受长度；(2)基于组的草稿策略训练-通过对比当前和冻结参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格的代理更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，GTO将接受长度提高了7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3实现了额外的7.7%加速。

Conclusion: GTO通过弥合草稿策略不匹配，为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但因其冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 基于token弹性现象，采用多轮自适应压缩策略，逐步压缩CoT推理过程，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Result: 相比最先进基线方法，平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟，且性能可预测。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，无需重复微调即可实现高效模型选择和性能预测。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

Motivation: 解决传统上下文学习(ICL)处理大量演示时效率低下，以及监督微调(SFT)训练开销大且缺乏灵活性的问题，探索将上下文信息直接映射到适配器参数的替代方案。

Method: 引入CompAs元学习框架，将上下文转换为具有组合结构的适配器参数，支持代数合并，能够无缝整合指令、演示或检索段落，无需重新处理长提示。

Result: 在多种选择题和抽取式问答任务上的实证结果显示，CompAs在扩展到更多输入时优于ICL和先前的基于生成器的方法，特别是在降低推理成本、提高长上下文稳定性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CompAs确立了可组合适配器生成作为扩展LLM部署的实用高效替代方案，通过可逆编码机制还支持输入上下文恢复，有助于安全性和安全性保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

### [230] [The Outputs of Large Language Models are Meaningless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22206)
*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文论证大语言模型（LLMs）的输出是无意义的，因为LLMs缺乏必要的意图来赋予其输出字面意义，尽管这些输出在表面上看起来有意义且能被用来获取真信念和知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型输出的语义地位，质疑其是否真正具有字面意义，旨在澄清LLMs在语义学上的局限性。

Method: 基于两个关键前提进行论证：(a) 某些意图是LLMs输出具有字面意义所必需的；(b) LLMs不可能拥有这类意图。同时反驳了语义外在主义和内在主义的可能回应。

Result: 论证支持LLMs输出无字面意义的结论，但承认这些输出在表面上显得有意义，并能用于获取真信念和知识。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs的输出缺乏字面意义，但其表面上的意义性和实用性仍使其在信息获取和知识传播中具有价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了递归主题划分(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型构建可解释的二进制树形主题分类，解决了传统主题模型关键词解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，且仅提供关键词列表需要大量人工解释，缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: 使用大语言模型交互式构建二进制树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上划分数据，形成完全可解释的分类体系。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线模型的关键词主题更具可解释性，且在数据主题与任务标签相关时，这些聚类可作为下游分类任务的有效特征。

Conclusion: RTP为数据探索引入了新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径还可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致性模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StableToken，一种通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定性的语义语音标记器，解决了现有标记器对无关声学扰动的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音标记器在捕获语言内容时出人意料地脆弱，即使在高信噪比下，对无关意义的声学扰动也很敏感，导致输出标记序列剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 引入StableToken标记器，采用多分支并行处理音频架构，通过强大的位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的标记序列。

Result: StableToken在标记稳定性方面达到新的最先进水平，在各种噪声条件下显著降低了单元编辑距离(UED)。这种基础稳定性直接转化为下游优势，显著提高了SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableToken通过共识驱动机制成功解决了语义语音标记器的稳定性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供了更可靠的输入表示。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出复合推理(CR)方法，让大语言模型能够动态组合多种推理风格，在科学和医学问答任务中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型依赖单一的推理范式，限制了其在需要多样化认知策略的复杂问题上的表现。

Method: 复合推理方法，允许模型动态探索和组合演绎、归纳、溯因等多种推理风格。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法超越了Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，大语言模型能够获得更强大、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反向推测解码(RSD)方法解决大模型向小模型迁移推理能力时的分布不对齐问题，通过让学生模型基于自身概率分布过滤教师生成的低概率token，显著提升推理能力迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型监督微调在推理能力迁移上往往失败，性能反而下降，这源于分布不对齐问题——大模型的推理轨迹包含学生模型分布下低概率的token，超出了小模型的内部表示能力。

Method: 提出反向推测解码(RSD)：教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，从而生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验表明，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使平均性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练则提升4.9%。低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: RSD能有效解决推理能力迁移中的分布不对齐问题，但RSD轨迹具有模型特异性，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

TL;DR: 提出了FeatBench基准测试，专门评估LLM在vibe coding范式下的功能实现能力，填补了现有代码生成基准测试的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试不适合评估vibe coding能力，它们要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，而忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，具有纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例和多样化的应用领域等特点。

Result: 评估显示vibe coding范式下的功能实现具有挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%，并发现了"激进实现"策略的双重影响。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了重要工具，揭示了vibe coding中功能实现的挑战和LLM的行为模式。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

TL;DR: 提出了FLEXI基准，这是首个专门评估全双工语音交互LLM在紧急场景下中断能力的基准测试，揭示了开源和商业模型在紧急意识、对话终止和交互延迟方面的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是实现自然人机交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急场景下的中断能力评估。

Method: 开发了FLEXI基准，通过六个多样化的人-LLM交互场景系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和对话效果，特别关注模型在紧急情况下的中断能力。

Result: 发现开源模型和商业模型在紧急意识、对话终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距，商业模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测为实现真正无缝和类人的全双工交互提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出安全合规概念，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建新基准，并通过GRPO方法训练Compliance Reasoner安全推理器，在基准测试中显著提升合规性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法确保现代LLM系统复杂行为的安全性。需要从法律合规角度建立严谨的安全标准。

Method: 1) 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR法律框架构建安全合规基准；2) 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升10.45%，GDPR平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 法律合规框架为LLM安全提供了系统化标准，Compliance Reasoner能有效将LLM与法律标准对齐，降低安全风险。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到LLM的推理过程中，解决幻觉问题和嵌入空间不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM处理幻觉问题的主要方法是结合知识图谱，但通常将KG视为纯文本，仅提取语义信息而忽略了关键的结构方面。另一个挑战是KG编码器和LLM文本嵌入之间的嵌入空间差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出SSKG-LLM模型，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块、知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义同时利用结构，以及知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLM能够理解KG嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合KG结构信息如何增强LLM的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，提升LLM的事实推理能力，解决了现有方法在处理KG时的局限性。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常复制或放大训练数据中的社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中，对编码器和仅解码器模型进行了系统研究，考察了三个关键维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 研究发现基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为有用的监督来减少训练中的偏见，但在候选模型中选择公平模型方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 基于输入的解释在检测和缓解偏见方面有价值，但不能可靠地用于模型选择，这为公平NLP中可解释性的应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Motivation: 自动化自然语言到一阶逻辑的翻译对知识表示和形式方法至关重要，但目前仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调的Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型以及ccg2lambda等符号系统。谓词可用性提升性能15-20%，T5模型优于更大的仅解码器LLMs，模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译被证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系推理的能力，以及模型规模对此能力的影响，这对于确保大语言模型事实正确性至关重要。

Method: 通过生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维子空间中可嵌入的"网格状"有向图的连通性，图维度是预测模型能力的重要指标。模型规模增加能提升在网格图上的泛化能力，但对于包含多个不连通分量的非网格图学习困难。

Conclusion: Transformer能够学习特定类型图的传递关系推理，但能力受图结构和模型规模影响，在复杂图结构上表现有限。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

superiority of models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned to
invective detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication

*Niharika Hegde,Subarnaduti Paul,Lars Joel-Frey,Manuel Brack,Kristian Kersting,Martin Mundt,Patrick Schramowski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHRONOBERG是一个时间结构化的英文书籍语料库，跨越250年，用于研究语言的时间演变和训练具有时间感知能力的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLMs理解语言语义和规范演变的能力。需要支持语言历时变化分析和训练的时间感知模型。

Method: 从Project Gutenberg收集英文书籍文本，构建时间结构化语料库，进行时间敏感的VAD情感分析，创建历史校准的情感词典。

Result: 现代LLM工具在检测歧视性语言和跨时间情感分析方面表现不足，按时间顺序训练的模型难以编码历时语义变化。

Conclusion: 需要时间感知的训练和评估流程，CHRONOBERG可作为研究语言变化和时间泛化的可扩展资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

### [245] [Exploratory Semantic Reliability Analysis of Wind Turbine Maintenance Logs using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22366)
*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个使用大型语言模型(LLMs)对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越了传统的文本分类方法，实现了故障模式识别、因果链推理等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中包含大量非结构化文本信息，传统定量可靠性分析难以利用这些数据。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在分类层面，无法进行复杂推理分析。

Method: 引入探索性框架，利用LLMs进行深度语义分析，执行四个分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推理、比较站点分析和数据质量审计。

Result: LLMs能够作为强大的"可靠性副驾驶"，超越简单标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专业级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新颖且可复现的方法论，将LLMs用作推理工具，为风能行业提供新的途径来增强运营智能，挖掘非结构化数据中隐藏的洞察。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

*Tanise Ceron,Dmitry Nikolaev,Dominik Stammbach,Debora Nozza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了开源大语言模型OLMO2的训练数据政治偏见，发现左倾文档在训练数据中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策议题上的偏见高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在政治偏见，但偏见来源尚不清楚。当前LLM研究中对训练数据政治内容的分析不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 分析OLMO2的预训练和后训练语料库，随机抽取大样本，自动标注文档政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源讨论相似话题；训练数据主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据整理流程中整合政治内容分析，并详细记录过滤策略以提高透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera是一个包含7500个高质量维基百科图表的测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖捷径行为而非真正理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视觉语言模型在图表相关基准测试中表现良好但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径的问题，评估模型是否真正理解和推理图表

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含语义三元组标注和多层次问题，评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个维度，检测三种捷径行为

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其表面上的强表现主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在严重局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解，而不仅仅是问答捷径

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答问题的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别无答案问题，并具有良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常在缺乏足够信息时仍自信回答，导致幻觉答案。需要解决不可回答性检测问题，特别是在抽取式问答中判断段落是否包含足够信息来回答问题。

Method: 在模型激活空间中识别一个捕捉不可回答性的方向，通过在推理时应用激活加法并测量其对模型弃权行为的影响来选择该方向。将隐藏激活投影到此方向可获得可靠的不可回答性分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有的基于提示和分类器的方法。该方法还能扩展到其他类型的不可回答性，如缺乏科学共识和主观性问题。

Conclusion: 通过因果干预证明，添加或消融该方向能有效控制模型的弃权行为，为LLM的不可回答性检测提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率通常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境下的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，通过字符和词级扰动测试对抗鲁棒性，并开发了开源模块化评估管道支持多语言、任务多样的基准测试。

Result: 法律推理基准测试准确率低于50%，而通用任务准确率超过70%；LLaMA表现弱于Gemini，后者平均优势约24个百分点；语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex是一个神经代理框架，通过将代理置于真实词汇系统中并操纵其交际需求来模拟语义变化，在颜色命名任务中展示了神经代理能够重现类似人类的命名模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的观察性方法无法揭示语义变化的因果机制，而人类实验范式难以应用于历时语义变化过程，因此需要新的模拟框架来研究语义变化的机制。

Method: 使用神经代理框架NeLLCom-Lex，首先将代理置于真实词汇系统（如英语）中，然后系统性地操纵其交际需求，通过监督学习和强化学习管道训练代理在颜色命名任务中发展词汇系统。

Result: 实验表明，经过训练能够'说'现有语言的神经代理在颜色命名任务中能够显著程度地重现类似人类的模式，支持了NeLLCom-Lex在阐明语义变化机制方面的进一步应用。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架成功地模拟了语义变化过程，证明了神经代理能够发展出类似人类的命名行为和词汇系统，为研究语义变化的因果机制提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Motivation: 现有工作主要通过监督微调或强化学习来提升LLM的问题解决能力，本文从解决方案分歧的新视角出发，探索LLM对同一问题生成不同解决方案的多样性与其问题解决能力的关系。

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域测试该指标对监督微调和强化学习策略的改进效果。

Result: 实验表明，解决方案分歧与问题解决能力呈正相关，使用该指标能持续提高成功率。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Result: 在成功预测和模型选择任务中取得竞争性或最先进的结果，在样本外场景下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的LLM表示方案，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出AMBS框架，通过两阶段1对N Transformer解码器解决多目标对齐中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题，在多个7B LLM上显著提升HHH对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化单个对齐目标时会覆盖其他目标的表示（灾难性遗忘），而简单的多分支设计会导致不同目标间的输出不一致（推理碎片化）。

Method: 两阶段1对N框架：第一阶段计算共享表示，第二阶段通过策略参考机制在并行分支中进行目标特定控制，保持跨目标一致性。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验显示，AMBS在多个7B LLM上持续改进HHH对齐，相比朴素1对N基线平均对齐分数提升32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS实现了统一高效的多目标对齐，在保持与最先进方法竞争力的同时，显著提升了多目标对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的FP8训练方案，通过细粒度混合粒度量化策略，在保持数值精度的同时实现计算效率最大化，证明FP8训练可以达到与BF16基线相当的性能，同时显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本是创新的主要障碍，FP8训练虽然提供了显著的理论效率增益，但由于缺乏全面开源训练方案而未被广泛采用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值精度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方案不仅非常稳定且基本无损，在推理基准测试中与BF16基线性能相当，同时训练时间减少22%，峰值内存使用降低14%，吞吐量提高19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以进一步民主化大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Result: CogFlow有效提升了LLMs和人类的社会认知能力，带来更有效的社交决策

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了LLMs在社交情境中的不足，为复杂社交互动提供了结构化解决方案

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

### [258] [Fine-Grained Detection of Context-Grounded Hallucinations Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22582)
*Yehonatan Pesiakhovsky,Zorik Gekhman,Yosi Mass,Liat Ein-Dor,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用LLMs定位上下文幻觉（模型输出中无法从源文本验证的信息）的可行性，构建了专门的基准测试，并提出基于自由文本描述的新表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉定位评估流程复杂，缺乏针对LLMs的基准测试，且现有表示方法限制了可表达的错误类型。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个示例的人类标注基准测试，提出基于自由文本描述的幻觉表示方法，评估了四种大规模LLMs，分析了最佳提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型仅达到0.67的F1分数，发现LLMs倾向于错误地将缺失细节标记为不一致，且难以处理包含模型参数知识但源文本中不存在的事实信息。

Conclusion: LLMs在幻觉定位任务上仍面临挑战，需要改进提示策略和解决模型参数知识与源文本验证之间的冲突。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: 亚正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严格且可解释的基础，证明了其在语言学习中的实用价值。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable

observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media
opinion mining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验性能得分的变化来自模型和数据两方面因素，需要同时考虑这两者以避免严重低估整体变异性

Method: 使用重采样方法，在多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务中应用

Result: 重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布，如平均值/中位数、模型间成对差异和排名

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试不确定性的有效工具

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种训练流程，通过后训练高效扩展预训练循环神经网络的状态大小，提升长上下文回忆能力，而不显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型处理长上下文成本高，而RNN模型虽然复杂度低，但状态大小固定导致长上下文回忆能力不足。直接训练大状态RNN成本高昂。

Method: 为线性注意力和状态空间模型设计后训练架构修改，扩展状态大小而不增加参数，通过StateX训练流程实现高效状态扩展。

Result: 在1.3B参数模型上的实验表明，StateX能有效提升RNN的回忆和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不影响其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文任务中的局限性，同时保持了低复杂度优势。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将思维轨迹作为潜变量的变分推理框架，通过变分推理优化语言模型的推理能力，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型提供一个原则性的概率视角，通过变分推理框架来改进推理能力，并统一变分推理与强化学习方法。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式来稳定变分后验的训练。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型家族上验证了方法的有效性，在广泛推理任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一变分推理与强化学习方法的概率视角，为提升语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

*Renjie Luo,Zichen Liu,Xiangyan Liu,Chao Du,Min Lin,Wenhu Chen,Wei Lu,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略（FCP），将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练和在线自举阶段让LLM直接从语言反馈中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息损失和尺度不平衡问题，需要更直接利用语言反馈的方法。

Method: FCP通过离线数据学习响应-反馈对的条件后验分布，并在在线阶段生成积极条件下的响应并获取新反馈进行自我优化。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLM提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP方法能够更有效地利用语言反馈的丰富信息，避免了传统标量奖励方法的局限性。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

### [266] [Death of the Novel(ty): Beyond n-Gram Novelty as a Metric for Textual Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22641)
*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现n-gram新颖性作为创造力评估指标存在不足，需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性（实用性和意义性）。研究表明，虽然n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨n-gram新颖性作为创造力评估指标的充分性，因为创造力理论表明创造力具有双重性质：新颖性和适当性，而n-gram新颖性只关注了新颖性方面。

Method: 通过7542个专家作者注释（n=26）对人工和AI生成文本的新颖性、实用性和意义性进行细读评估，研究n-gram新颖性与创造力的关系。

Result: 研究发现：1）n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关；2）91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的；3）开源LLM中更高的n-gram新颖性与更低的实用性相关；4）前沿闭源模型比人类更不可能产生创造性表达。

Conclusion: 结论是n-gram新颖性不应单独用作创造力评估指标，需要同时考虑适当性。LLM在识别创造性表达方面表现优于随机但仍有改进空间，特别是在识别非实用性表达方面。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent是一个创新的网站生成代理系统，通过多层次的视觉反馈机制迭代生成和优化网站代码，结合视觉语言模型和GUI代理测试来评估网站质量，并使用Step-GRPO训练方法提升LLM的网站生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码代理在网站代码生成任务中仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是在视觉效果和用户交互方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，利用视觉语言模型分析网站截图生成详细文本描述和建议，结合GUI代理测试评分，采用回溯和择优机制，并引入Step-GRPO训练方法使用截图和GUI代理分数作为过程监督奖励信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升至51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升至3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升至45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升至3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过综合视觉反馈机制显著提升了网站生成的质量和准确性，证明了视觉反馈在代码生成任务中的重要性，为基于LLM的代理系统提供了有效的性能提升方法。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估语音AI助手的完整能力范围，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含10,497个样本的基准测试，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及多样化图像的视觉任务。

Result: 评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio，发现专有模型并非全面优于开源模型，大多数模型在说话任务表现良好但在音频理解方面滞后，设计良好的小模型可以匹敌大模型。

Conclusion: VoiceAssistant-Eval识别了当前模型的差距，为下一代AI助手的发展提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食品零售业面临食物浪费和产品短缺的双重挑战，需要找到客户购买行为与供应策略之间的最佳平衡点。

Method: 首先从杂货店销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链形式的随机过程，然后扩展供应活动，最后进行假设分析评估产品数量随时间的变化。

Result: 能够识别出客户购买行为与供应策略之间的最优平衡，有效防止因过度供应导致的食物浪费和产品短缺问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售商提供了有效的分析工具，有助于优化库存管理和减少食物浪费。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重分配方案来改进物理信息神经网络(PINNs)的训练稳定性，其中第二种方案结合了可量化与不可量化项，在多个基准测试中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络(PINNs)提供无网格求解PDE的框架，但对损失权重选择高度敏感，需要改进训练稳定性。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重分配方案：第一种基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化与不可量化项，实现更平衡的训练。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和顶盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重分配持续提高了稳定性和准确性。特别是在高佩克莱特数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失效的情况下，采用该方案的PINNs仍能获得稳定准确的预测。

Conclusion: 该权重分配方案显著增强了PINNs在计算流体动力学问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD
problems.

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能作为通用实验设计代理进行上下文实验设计

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在实践中无法进行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

TL;DR: NUFILT是一个数据自由的持续模型融合框架，通过零空间过滤和轻量级LoRA适配器实现透明度和保真度，在无需任务数据的情况下融合独立微调的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由持续模型融合中如何在没有任务数据的情况下确保透明度（不干扰先前任务）和保真度（忠实适应新任务）的挑战。

Method: 使用零空间投影器过滤新任务向量中的重叠组件确保透明度，结合轻量级LoRA适配器注入互补任务特定信号实现保真度，通过投影替代损失训练适配器。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，减少遗忘并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过联合过滤-适应过程有效吸收新知识同时保留现有行为，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实证表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Method: 使用Transformer架构，在自回归设置下训练模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖性，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期行为。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM决策树生成方法提供了可解释性、偏差检查和人工干预能力，是表格基础模型的有价值替代方案

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Conclusion: SIGN方法成功地将扩散模型与幂等网络结合，提供了稳定训练、快速推理和灵活的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Method: 通过理论分析建立幻觉的形式化定义，推导出通用数据分布下幻觉率的高概率下界，并在硬币聚合、开放式问答和文本到图像生成等任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明即使是最优损失最小化估计器仍会产生幻觉，实验结果表明理论分析与实际观察一致。

Conclusion: 幻觉问题源于损失最小化与人类期望输出之间的结构性错位，本质上是校准错误引起的估计误差。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 保形数据增强是一种有效的原则性数据过滤方法，能够显著提升模型性能，且实现简单、无需复杂模型重训练。

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了严格的零阶优化理论保证，其开发的浓度不等式工具具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Conclusion: 这是首个无需训练、基于激活指导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供理论清晰性和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

Motivation: 强化学习微调（RFT）经常面临奖励过度优化问题，即模型通过欺骗奖励信号获得高分但产生低质量输出。理论分析表明关键在于高奖励尾部的奖励规范错误：无法可靠地区分优秀响应和良好响应。

Method: 研究基于评分标准的奖励机制，通过设计评分标准来利用离策略示例（如来自更强模型或重写的示例），同时保持对它们人工痕迹的不敏感性。提出了区分优秀且多样化响应并实现这一想法的工作流程。

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决RFT中奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例来改善模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac是一种快速图像生成器，使用阻尼波动方程和其随机Kac表示来以有限速度移动概率质量。与扩散模型相比，它实现了有限速度传输和全局有界动能，并通过端点蒸馏实现了高质量样本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得僵硬并隐含允许无界传播速度，而Kac动力学能够强制执行有限速度传输并产生全局有界动能，提供更好的数值稳定性。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示；引入速度空间中的无分类器引导；提出端点蒸馏方法，训练学生模型在长区间内匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够以非常少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合了有限速度传输的理论优势和端点蒸馏的实践效率，在保持数值稳定性的同时实现了快速高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型主要关注提高预测准确性，但在学生选择干扰项时预测错误最多，导致学生错误未被检测到。需要为KT模型增加捕捉预测不确定性的新能力。

Method: 通过捕捉知识追踪模型的预测不确定性，并证明较大的预测不确定性与模型错误预测相关。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架来解释两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，揭示了从懒惰学习到独立特征学习再到交互特征学习的三个阶段动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述在复杂结构化输入下，特征如何出现、如何发展以及在什么条件下发生。

Method: 通过分析反向传播梯度G_F的结构变化来表征三个关键阶段：懒惰学习阶段G_F随机，独立特征学习阶段每个节点的梯度仅依赖自身激活，交互特征学习阶段隐藏节点相互作用。

Result: 证明了独立动态遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，其局部最大值就是涌现的特征；揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用；推导了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放定律。

Conclusion: 该研究从梯度动力学第一原理揭示了grokking现象的内在机制，解释了为什么Muon等优化器有效，并且分析框架可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过整合教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器，重新构建半监督学习结构，在低标签场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键局限性，包括静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模等问题。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师、以及扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签场景下始终达到最先进性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉骨干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo通过三元博弈论协同训练提供了一个原则性和可推广的解决方案，有效解决了现有SSL框架的关键限制。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的安全框架，将控制理论工具应用于LLM推理过程，通过运行时监控和最小限制性转向机制来防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的安全方法RLHF在训练阶段有效，但在推理阶段无法提供安全保障，仍可能产生不安全内容，需要推理时的安全保护机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，估计轨迹的最坏情况演化，实现运行时监控和潜在状态的最小扰动转向。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测到不安全延续，显著减少不安全生成，同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Motivation: LLM在数据增强中具有强大生成能力，但在医疗等高风险领域存在生成临床错误或误导信息的风险，需要解决LLM增强潜力与专业领域安全要求之间的差距。

Method: 采用轻量级的协作方法，通过查询机制整合专家级领域知识来指导增强过程，确保关键医疗信息的准确性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

Motivation: 探讨归纳头是否能够支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习，而不仅仅是简单的复制和预测重复模式。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中令牌以层次依赖关系重复出现，并评估了一系列LLMs在这些令牌序列和自然语言类似物上的表现。

Result: 发现了适应性的归纳头，这些归纳头通过学习在上下文中关注什么来支持预测。还发现学习是由揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头支持的，这些上下文决定了不同的令牌转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅展示了LLMs具有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了一个完整的机制性解释，说明LLMs如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Method: 借鉴非人类动物元认知研究，采用两种实验范式测试模型能否策略性地利用内部状态知识，并分析token概率。

Result: 前沿LLMs显示出特定元认知能力，但分辨率有限、情境依赖且与人类存在质的不同。不同能力相似的模型间存在差异，表明后训练可能影响元认知发展。

Conclusion: LLMs确实表现出元认知能力，但这些能力有限且与人类不同，后训练可能在其中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Conclusion: 本书系统性地构建了机器学习中处理选择不确定性的统计理论框架，为离线监督学习和在线学习提供了可靠的理论分析工具。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切换动态系统由于离散状态空间的限制，难以捕捉平滑、变速的转换以及随机混合的重叠状态，在实际数据中经常出现虚假的快速切换问题。

Method: 引入离散状态的连续松弛，在松弛离散状态空间上定义基于Gumbel分布的噪声模型，使模型完全可微分，支持标准梯度下降方法进行快速可扩展训练。

Result: 在标准仿真数据集上验证了模型能力，能够建模软粘性状态和随机设置中的转换，并在两个真实世界数据集上展示了在具有多个动态的随机时间序列中推断可解释状态的能力。

Conclusion: GDM通过连续松弛扩展了可用状态动态的范围，能够更准确地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动态，在传统方法经常失败的随机时间序列多动态建模场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在异构和隐私敏感环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

*Marco Paul E. Apolinario,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种一次性高阶SVD的低秩激活压缩框架，用于设备端学习和持续学习，显著减少内存使用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但现有激活压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，计算开销大，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，避免重复分解，并为持续学习分配正交子空间。

Result: 在多个数据集上减少激活存储达250倍，准确性接近完整反向传播；在持续学习基准测试中性能与正交梯度投影方法相当，内存成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: LANCE是设备端高效微调和持续学习的实用可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练策略的方法，在ViT-Large模型训练过程中从全参数训练切换到低秩适应(LoRA)，显著减少可训练参数和资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型训练资源密集，且大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可通过低秩矩阵捕捉

Method: 使用用户定义超参数确定切换点，并根据各模块层的收敛程度分配特定秩，动态从全参数训练切换到LoRA

Result: 保持模型准确性的同时，将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了大型模型训练的资源需求，同时保持了模型性能，为高效训练提供了可行方案

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法HIP，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，且在多种下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高到l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessian比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高、训练更容易，且在系统规模扩展性方面更有利。

Conclusion: HIP方法在过渡态搜索、加速几何优化、零点能校正和振动分析等广泛下游任务中验证了其优越性能，为直接预测Hessian矩阵开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制实现局部秩放大，在保持参数效率的同时提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PEFT方法中全局调制限制和秩约束问题，需要资源高效且能处理异构推理变换的方法

Method: 将权重矩阵分块，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，实现局部秩放大

Result: 在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，BHRA在匹配参数预算下持续超越强PEFT基线

Conclusion: 块状设计能维持丰富的频谱，缓解全局调制引起的崩溃，在多个模型上表现优异

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管掩码预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归框架分析掩码预训练行为，提出随机随机掩码自编码(R²MAE)方案，强制模型捕获多尺度特征。

Result: R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中一致优于标准和更复杂的掩码方案，提升了最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 线性模型框架揭示了掩码预训练的新特性，R²MAE作为一种简单有效的预训练方案，在多个领域表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为AI系统中的安全性、可信度和通用人工智能这些概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的基本关系。

Method: 采用严格的数学定义：安全性定义为系统从不做出错误声明，可信度定义为假设系统是安全的，AGI定义为AI系统始终匹配或超越人类能力。通过程序验证、规划和图可达性等领域的证明来展示不兼容性。

Result: 核心发现：对于这些形式化定义，安全且可信的AI系统不能是AGI系统——存在某些任务实例，人类可以轻松且可证明地解决，但该系统无法解决。

Conclusion: 安全、可信与AGI之间存在根本性不兼容，这可以看作是哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性证明的另一种解释。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

Motivation: 现有基于引导的方法简单但引入偏差，而基于粒子的校正方法存在权重退化和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中漂移和粒子势之间未被探索的自由度，开发了方差控制和能量控制引导(VCG/ECG)来近似最优漂移。

Result: 在混合高斯模型、粒子系统和大规模蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite一致地减少了方差并提高了样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一种原则性、高效的途径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，这些假设可能与真实数据生成过程不符，且往往忽略离散数据中的复杂依赖结构，只考虑线性效应。

Method: 将学习问题表述为最一般形式的单一可微优化任务，避免先前方法采用的不切实际的简化。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中不可识别，但可以描述兼容参数和结构的完整集合，并在温和假设下建立了马尔可夫等价性识别。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models

accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成的不同方法，支持任意程度的知识规范，同时保持模型的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识驱动的单调性约束来正则化模型行为，缓解过拟合，从而提升深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at

Result: 在16个分类和回归下游任务中，SlotFM在13个任务上优于现有自监督方法，在其余任务上与最佳方法性能相当，平均性能提升4.5%。

Conclusion: SlotFM展示了感知基础模型的强泛化能力，能够超越标准人类活动识别任务，适用于更广泛的加速度计应用场景。

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为子流形上的光滑无约束优化，利用黎曼几何结构，通过二阶三次正则化黎曼牛顿算法求解，并将流形分解为乘积流形以线性时间解决每个牛顿子问题。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼优化框架为K-means聚类提供了高效且理论保证的求解方法，在收敛速度和统计精度方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

TL;DR: Prophecy是一个自动推断前馈神经网络形式化属性的工具，通过分析内部层神经元激活状态来提取规则，这些规则作为前提条件可以保证期望的输出属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络内部逻辑很大程度上体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，通过分析这些状态可以提取出形式化属性，用于解释、验证和监控神经网络行为。

Method: 基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）提取规则，这些规则作为前提条件可以推导出期望的输出属性，如特定类别的预测。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具，展示了其在各种模型和输出属性上的应用，包括形式化解释、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等，并在大型视觉语言模型时代展示了潜力。

Conclusion: Prophecy通过分析神经网络内部层激活状态来推断形式化属性，为神经网络的可解释性、验证和监控提供了有效工具，在大型模型时代具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer指导的推测解码框架，利用多序列比对提取的k-mer基序整合生物、结构和功能先验，在保持推测解码效率的同时显著提高蛋白质序列生成的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中面临生成延迟问题，而传统推测解码中的草稿模型通常忽略蛋白质的结构和功能约束，导致生物不可信的输出和生成序列似然分布的偏移。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer基序来整合生物、结构和功能先验，通过并行评分候选序列并选择与已知生物模式最一致的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现了24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER框架在保持推测解码效率的同时，通过整合生物先验知识显著提高了蛋白质序列生成的可信度和质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

*Saurabh Kataria,Davood Fattahi,Minxiao Wang,Ran Xiao,Matthew Clark,Timothy Ruchti,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了三种正交改进方法，通过使用最少的辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG信号的心脏骤停预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性学习和伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生理基础模型（如PPG-GPT）虽然能预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在下游数据/标签稀缺时未能充分利用。需要开发更有效的方法来提升PPG-only心脏骤停系统的性能。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模：通过简单回归事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模；2. 患者身份不变性学习：训练大规模去识别生物特征识别模型（p-vector），并对其使用对抗性训练来消除可能导致过拟合的身份线索；3. 伪标签回归：使用预训练的辅助估计网络生成伪连续估计作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签。

Result: 提出的方法能独立将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，主要在较长时域内改进，事件附近性能下降最小，推动了早期预警系统研究。

Conclusion: 通过三种正交改进方法，成功提升了PPG-only心脏骤停预测系统的性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下，为早期预警系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Method: 结合精确子图枚举、神经网络和稀疏正则化，通过子图枚举捕捉图结构信息，稀疏正则化实现有效剪枝和重要子图识别。

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选择的子图进行事后分析。

Conclusion: EIN成功实现了高判别能力和可解释性的平衡，为图级别预测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的方法为改进交通服务和城市发展提供了分析进展和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性持续挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖所有客户端参与全局训练后再进行本地适配，需要更早期的质量控制方法

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似性，基于相似性估计实现客户端选择策略，让客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上集成三种现有联邦学习算法进行测试，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，即使在参与者有限的情况下；与基线聚类算法IFCA相比，在低参与场景下表现更优

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中具有可扩展性和有效性，通过早期质量控制改善了数据异构性带来的性能挑战

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Motivation: 现代机器学习面临的核心挑战是如何在看似顺序的模型中利用并行性。现有的固定点方法缺乏统一的理论基础。

Method: 将不同的固定点迭代方法（牛顿、皮卡德、雅可比）统一到线性动力系统框架中，将其视为非线性递归的近似线性化。

Result: 建立了一个共同的理论框架，揭示了这些技术背后的共享原理，并阐明了不同固定点方法最有效的适用条件。

Conclusion: 该框架为并行化顺序模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并为高效可扩展计算指出了新的机会。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Motivation: 双层优化问题具有复杂的嵌套结构，相比其他贝叶斯优化的扩展（如多目标或约束设置）研究较少。当上下层都涉及昂贵的黑盒函数时，需要有效的优化方法。

Result: 通过多个基准数据集实证验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的信息论方法能够有效处理双层优化问题，在上下层都涉及昂贵黑盒函数的情况下表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 识别客观的神经影像生物标志物来预测阿尔茨海默病进展对于及时干预至关重要，但由于脑网络时空特性的复杂功能障碍常被现有方法忽视，这一任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发可解释的时空图神经网络框架，利用双随机微分方程(SDEs)建模不规则采样的纵向功能磁共振成像(fMRI)数据，学习稀疏的区域和连接重要性概率。

Result: 在OASIS-3和ADNI两个独立队列上验证有效，识别出海马旁回、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，发现腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著破坏，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状强相关。

Conclusion: 基于时空图的学习方法具有早期、个体化预测AD进展的潜力，即使在纵向成像数据不规则采样的背景下，揭示了已建立和新颖的神经系统水平及性别特异性生物标志物。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低，现有LLM方法未能充分利用优化轨迹的连续性信息，需要更高效的迭代优化策略。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，通过轨迹级优化强化成功策略，轮次级偏好学习提供密集比较反馈，从完整优化轨迹中学习。

Result: 在单属性任务中达到84%的平均成功率(比基线高2.3倍)，多属性任务中达到50%成功率，仅需500次oracle评估。

Conclusion: POLO通过充分利用优化轨迹信息和双重学习机制，显著推进了样本高效分子优化的技术水平。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，同时避免不相关信息，实现了高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free

Result: 在广泛评估中，SubZeroCore无需训练即可匹配基于训练的方法，在高剪枝率下显著优于它们，同时大幅减少计算开销，对标签噪声具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SubZeroCore展示了实际有效性和可扩展性，为现实场景提供了一种高效的核心集选择解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

*Jaemin Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重参数化方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络的连续函数，消除传统4DVAR的时间序列依赖，实现参数空间中的并行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR代价函数难以优化且计算密集，需要更高效的数据同化方法。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态，通过物理约束损失直接融入物理规律，简化实现并降低计算成本。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程上测试，相比基线4DVAR，神经重参数化变体产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无伪振荡。

Conclusion: 该方法无需地面真实状态或再分析数据，在参考信息有限的环境中具有更广泛适用性。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

TL;DR: 使用fNIRS和机器学习检测多发性硬化症患者在进行手部灵巧任务时的大脑活动生物标志物，发现顶下小叶/角回和中央前回是重要脑区，脱氧血红蛋白比常规氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现能解释认知疲劳的大脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的MS患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层活动，采用机器学习框架分析数据。

Result: KNN分类器在单任务和双任务中分别达到75.0%和66.7%的准确率。XAI显示顶下小叶/角回和中央前回是最重要脑区，MS组活动受抑制且神经血管反应较慢。脱氧血红蛋白比氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非传统的fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)，通过评估公式在数值计算中的稳定性来衡量其结构合理性，提升符号回归算法发现的公式可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性代理，忽略了公式内部数学结构，导致发现的公式虽然形式紧凑但难以数学分析和解释。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过计算精度限制下有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构，提出有效信息准则(EIC)。

Result: EIC与搜索式符号回归结合提升Pareto前沿性能，减少不合理结构；与生成式算法结合将预训练样本需求减少2-4倍；与108位专家对公式可解释性偏好的吻合度达70.2%。

Conclusion: EIC通过衡量公式中的不合理结构，实际反映了公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供更有效的可解释性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力巨大，但其实际部署受到训练过程过慢的限制，主要原因是每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，使得生成阶段成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 1. 并发感知推测解码框架：根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；2. 在线草稿学习机制：使用目标模型的反馈信号持续适应草稿模型。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验结果表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，显著超越基线方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈问题，通过并发感知推测解码和在线草稿学习机制实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有疲劳检测研究多关注单一模态信号，但生理信号之间存在统计相关性，通过分析信号对之间的关系可以提升分类鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，提取ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG四种信号的特征，评估15种信号组合，采用决策树、随机森林、逻辑回归和XGBoost四种分类器进行性能比较。

Result: XGBoost配合EMG-EEG信号组合取得最佳性能，SHAP分析显示ECG-EOG相关性是关键特征，多信号模型始终优于单信号模型。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统混沌系统预测模型针对特定系统训练，缺乏泛化能力，无法应对现实世界中需要零样本或小样本预测的新场景或数据受限情况。

Method: 提出ChaosNexus基础模型，采用名为ScaleFormer的多尺度架构，并结合专家混合层，预训练在多样化混沌动力学语料库上。

Result: 在包含9000多个合成混沌系统的大规模测试平台上，长期吸引子统计保真度比领先基线提高40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中，零样本平均误差低于1度，且小样本微调可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: ChaosNexus的扩展行为为科学基础模型提供了指导原则：跨系统泛化源于训练系统的多样性，而非单纯的数据量。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Motivation: 预测材料特性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习可以帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。研究团队希望分析训练数据、模型规模和计算资源的扩展如何影响材料特性预测的性能。

Method: 训练了transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料特性，通过改变训练数据量、模型规模和计算资源这三个超参数，并建立了损失与这些参数之间的幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)。

Result: 发现了经验性的缩放规律，可以预测增加训练数据、模型规模和计算资源对预测性能的影响。损失与相关超参数之间存在幂律关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为材料特性预测领域提供了缩放规律的经验证据，未来可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的缩放规律，并与当前训练的模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM方法通常能引导训练到更平坦的极小值点以提升泛化能力，但研究发现它可能收敛到错误的极小值点，即幻觉极小值。

Method: 通过理论分析证明幻觉极小值的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实验验证实际收敛情况。

Result: 证明了SAM确实可能收敛到幻觉极小值点，这些点不是原始目标的真正极小值。

Conclusion: 提出了一个简单有效的补救措施来避免SAM收敛到幻觉极小值点。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Motivation: 稀疏奖励环境中缺乏中间奖励反馈，阻碍了标准多智能体强化学习算法的有效策略学习。

Method: 引入基于偏好的价值分解网络构建隐式多智能体奖励学习模型，生成全局和局部奖励信号，构建双重优势流，并利用大语言模型提供偏好标签。

Result: 在MAMuJoCo和SMACv2等基准测试中，该方法相比现有基线实现了更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

TL;DR: 该论文对掩码离散扩散进行了理论分析，提出了MATU方法，在文本生成中实现了比均匀离散扩散更优的复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码扩散的理论理解不足，特别是忽略了常用的Euler采样器、施加了限制性假设，未能展示掩码扩散相对于均匀扩散的优势。

Method: 分析了Euler采样器在掩码离散扩散中的性能，提出了Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)方法，该方法移除了有界分数假设并保持无偏离散分数近似。

Result: Euler采样器可实现$\epsilon$-精度的总变差，复杂度为$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$；MATU方法实现了接近$\epsilon$-无关的复杂度$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$，优于现有均匀化方法。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格的理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，为分析基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Motivation: 现代分析中经常涉及草图双线性形式，但现有统一边界方法要么不适用，要么在一般集合上不够锐利，需要开发新的分析框架。

Method: 采用通用链化方法，引入处理集合对极值的新技术，分析涉及多个独立草图矩阵求和的草图双线性形式。

Conclusion: 该统一分析框架为草图双线性形式提供了锐利边界，改进了联邦学习算法的收敛边界，并设计了具有更锐利遗憾边界的草图变体老虎机算法。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统虽然能够处理超出LLM上下文窗口的长输入，但性能严重依赖手工设计的协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 基于信息论压缩目标，提出GoA框架，动态构建输入依赖的协作结构，最大化信息压缩效率。

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的F1分数平均提升5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的多智能体基线提升16.35%。仅使用2K上下文窗口的GoA在LongBench上超越了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过形式化长上下文建模为压缩问题，实现了更高效的多智能体协作，显著提升了有效上下文长度和问答性能。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on

Motivation: 现有分子基础模型主要依赖SMILES表示，忽略了实验光谱和3D结构信息这两个在真实场景中捕捉分子行为的关键来源，限制了其在立体化学、空间构象和实验验证关键任务中的有效性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B预训练，明确建模分子光谱，将实验光谱与分子3D结构统一起来。

Result: 在光谱相关任务中平均准确率达到0.53（NMR、IR、MS基准测试）；在光谱分析任务中，光谱到SMILES的序列准确率为15.5%，标记准确率为41.7%，显著优于大型通用LLM；能够从SMILES或光谱输入直接生成准确的3D分子结构。

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks

critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.

TL;DR: LDAR是一种自适应检索方法，通过减少干扰性段落的影响，在减少token使用的同时显著提升性能，优于长上下文方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口增大，直接提供完整文档成为RAG的替代方案，但这种方法存在token效率低、"中间迷失"现象加剧、模型容量有限时干扰增强等问题。

Method: 提出LDAR（学习感知干扰的检索），这是一种自适应检索器，学习以减轻干扰性段落影响的方式检索上下文。

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要在信息覆盖和干扰之间平衡权衡，LDAR方法在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

TL;DR: ILP-CoT结合归纳逻辑编程和多模态大语言模型，通过MLLMs提出规则结构来缩减ILP搜索空间，实现从少量非结构化文本或视觉输入中归纳逻辑规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，以及MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，利用MLLMs即使出现幻觉也能提出结构正确规则的特点。

Method: 基于MLLMs提出的规则结构自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并展示了在文本到图像定制生成中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功桥接了ILP和MLLMs，通过结合两者的优势实现了更高效和准确的逻辑规则归纳。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are
released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

*Chaoyang Luo,Yan Zou,Nanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引区域与规定吸引区域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经网络ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络ODE由于其动力学系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法通常需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。然而，在施加适当稳定性条件方面存在困难，导致鲁棒性与准确性之间的紧张关系。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，通过三方损失（一致性损失、分类损失和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经网络ODE和Lyapunov函数。设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络，通过softmax注意力机制关注平衡点相关特征，并作为权重归一化保持深度架构的训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。理论上证明了最小化三方损失可以保证规定吸引区域与吸引区域的一致对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠规定吸引区域。

Conclusion: Zubov-Net通过主动控制吸引区域几何形状的新范式，成功调和了神经网络ODE的准确性和鲁棒性，为稳定学习提供了理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 验证RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实收益，解决评估过程中存在的夸大问题，建立更可靠的测量标准。

Method: 使用部分提示污染审计和匹配预算重现，对比基础模型和RL模型，提出税感知训练评估协议来标准化预算和来源检查。

Result: 在干净、对等控制的评估下，多个宣称的显著差距缩小或消失，税感知协议能提供更可靠的理由增益估计。

Conclusion: RLVR具有实用价值且已适合工业应用，但需要保持其实用优势的同时优先考虑可靠性、安全性和测量准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现oracle解通常与先前任务最优解保持低损失线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路

Method: IVT框架周期性地将模型参数传送到保持线性连接的变换解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升CIL基线性能，CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最后准确率+5.12%，FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率+14.93%

Conclusion: IVT是有效的即插即用框架，能稳定保持先前任务性能，适用于无样本和有样本场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要开发更精确的引导框架。

Method: 推导了给定离散流匹配模型的目标分布的精确转移率，使每个采样步骤仅需单次前向传播，显著提高效率。该统一框架包含现有引导方法作为特例，并可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型。

Conclusion: 提出的离散引导匹配框架为离散数据提供了精确高效的引导方法，统一了现有方法并在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

TL;DR: 提出Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，通过结合乘法部分和加法部分来改进CESR和GAMs，在保持可解释性的同时提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域应用机器学习时，可解释性至关重要。GAMs虽然可解释但忽略了高阶交互效应，CESR包含全特征交互但性能不如GAMs。

Method: MACMs在CESR基础上增加加法部分，分离交互项和独立项的系数，扩展假设空间。模型包含可自然可视化的乘法部分和加法部分。

Result: 基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和最先进的GAMs。

Conclusion: MACMs在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法交互和加法独立效应，实现了对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解有限训练样本下生成模型的行为提供了理论框架，揭示了估计误差对生成质量的影响机制。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中的优势得到了理论证明，并识别了实现最优性能所需的关键属性，同时讨论了基于梯度算法的优化联系。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过结构信息驱动的自适应分层扩散，有效解决了长时程稀疏奖励环境中的离线策略学习问题

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的攻击方法在找到高奖励提示后容易陷入局部最优，难以探索新的攻击模式，导致攻击多样性不足。

Method: 使用强化学习训练攻击者LLM，定期用收集的攻击提示对受害者LLM进行安全微调，使已利用区域的奖励降低，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞。

Result: Active Attacks显著优于现有RL方法，将对抗GFlowNets的跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升到31.28%，计算成本仅增加6%。

Conclusion: Active Attacks通过简单的即插即用模块实现了高效的多模式攻击探索，为LLM安全测试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

*Feng Jiang,Amina Mollaysa,Hehuan Ma,Tommaso Mansi,Junzhou Huang,Mangal Prakash,Rui Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAMDTI是一个多模态预训练框架，通过整合小分子和蛋白质的多模态信息，使用体积对比学习和自适应模态丢弃来提升药物靶点相互作用预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息。

Method: 提出GRAMDTI框架，整合多模态分子和蛋白质输入，使用四模态体积对比学习捕获高阶语义对齐，采用自适应模态丢弃动态调节各模态贡献，并引入IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督对于构建稳健且可泛化的DTI预测模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

*Cheng Jin,Qitan Shi,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了CFG在三个阶段的影响：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但降低多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解CFG对扩散模型采样动态的影响，特别是在多模态条件分布下的作用机制，因为现有研究仅限于单模态条件或简化情况。

Method: 分析CFG在多模态条件下的采样过程，将其分解为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 发现CFG在三个阶段分别导致初始化偏差、抑制弱模式和减少细粒度变异性，解释了语义对齐与多样性的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 提出了时变引导调度策略，实验证明该策略能同时提高生成质量和多样性。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化目标引导的强化学习方法SGRL，通过LLM生成可重用的结构化目标规划函数和动作剪枝机制，提高RL在复杂开放环境中的探索效率和长期规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界决策任务环境复杂开放，传统RL方法在探索效率和长期规划方面存在挑战。现有LLM增强RL方法依赖频繁昂贵的LLM调用且存在语义不匹配问题。

Method: SGRL包含结构化目标规划器和目标条件动作剪枝器。前者利用LLM生成可重用的结构化目标生成函数，动态生成前瞻性目标；后者使用动作掩码机制过滤与当前目标不一致的动作。

Result: 在Crafter和Craftax-Classic上的实验表明，SGRL相比现有最先进方法取得了更优的性能。

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效提升了RL在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策能力。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Concept-SAE通过混合解耦策略创建语义基础的概念标记，相比标准稀疏自编码器，能更可靠地进行因果探测和模型行为分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稀疏自编码器发现的特征具有模糊性和无基础性，无法可靠地用于模型行为的主动因果探测。

Method: 采用双监督的混合解耦策略，创建语义基础的概念标记，通过直接干预和系统定位来探测内部概念与预测之间的因果联系。

Result: 双监督方法产生的标记具有显著忠实性和空间局部性，在解耦方面优于其他方法，支持因果干预和对抗性漏洞定位。

Conclusion: Concept-SAE为从相关性解释转向机制性、因果性的模型行为探测提供了验证蓝图。

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个专为稀疏二分知识图谱设计的边增强框架，通过重采样现有训练边来提升链接预测性能，避免伪造端点，在多个稀疏图数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小众领域二分知识图谱数据稀缺和边稀疏的问题，这些特性阻碍了链接预测的性能。

Method: 提出AEGIS框架，采用边重采样方法（均匀简单采样或逆度偏置度感知采样），保持原始节点集不变，避免伪造端点。在自然稀疏图和人为稀疏化基准数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens数据集上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线持平，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN实现了最大的AUC改进和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的参数高效微调框架，通过动态提示和随机Fisher引导的自适应选择，在保持性能的同时大幅减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要针对视觉或语言任务设计，无法有效处理天气下游任务中的变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化等独特挑战，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：1) 前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示，通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；2) 反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择，利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与全参数微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法与全参数微调存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一个高效且有效的微调框架，解决了现有PEFT方法在天气任务中的局限性，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在各种语言任务上表现出色，但在组合优化问题（如可满足性、旅行商问题、基础算术）上表现不佳。本文旨在填补这一空白，专注于解决NP类问题中的数独问题。

Method: 使用纯解码器Transformer（GPT-2）模型，不依赖外部工具或函数调用。方法结合了数独规则的模仿学习和显式的深度优先搜索策略，包括有根据的猜测和回溯机制。

Result: 在数独任务上达到了99%的准确率，相比之前的神经符号方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将模仿学习与深度优先搜索相结合，为LLMs解决组合优化问题提供了新思路，并建立了与上下文Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级插件模块，通过高效聚类操作赋予几何图神经网络分层全局上下文，解决了传统几何GNN在长程交互建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络擅长捕捉分子几何结构，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以有效建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要复杂参数调优且计算开销大。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换传播这些上下文，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在四种不同骨干架构中集成MCGM，将OE62能量预测误差平均降低26.2%。在AQM数据集上达到最先进精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一个轻量级、即插即用的模块，能够有效增强几何GNN的全局建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升长程相互作用的建模性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）问题，影响特征的可解释性和质量。

Method: 引入新的训练过程，通过惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度来强制特征正交性，该方法计算复杂度随SAE规模线性增长。

Result: 相比传统SAE，OrtSAE发现更多独特特征(+9%)，显著减少特征吸收(-65%)和组合(-15%)，在虚假相关性移除任务上性能提升+6%，其他下游任务性能相当。

Conclusion: 正交约束有效缓解了SAE的特征纠缠问题，提升了特征解耦质量，为神经网络激活的稀疏分解提供了改进方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful

use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal
latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering
insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

Motivation: 在多目标强化学习任务中，GRPO算法容易受到奖励黑客问题的影响，即只优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标。由于现实中往往缺乏高度可靠的奖励模型，需要一种能够自动平衡多个奖励函数的方法。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO算法，通过归一化方法根据奖励函数值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数贡献均衡，同时保持偏好顺序，无需手动调整奖励函数尺度。

Result: 在四个领域（多臂老虎机问题、模拟控制任务、WMT基准的机器翻译任务、指令跟随任务）的实验评估表明，MO-GRPO通过均衡分配奖励组件间的相关性实现稳定学习，性能优于GRPO。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够有效解决奖励黑客问题，实现多目标的均衡优化。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate
MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem,
(ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on
the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO
achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the
components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising
algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

TL;DR: 本文分析了ReLU卷积神经网络中部分参数迁移的理论条件，揭示了迁移参数作为通用知识载体的作用机制，并解释了为何在某些情况下参数迁移反而会降低目标任务的测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在迁移学习中，当仅从上游模型转移部分参数到下游模型时，缺乏对参数重用有效性的理论理解，需要明确部分参数迁移在何种条件下有益以及影响其效果的关键因素。

Method: 在ReLU卷积神经网络的理论框架下，分析参数迁移机制，通过数值实验和真实数据实验验证理论发现。

Result: 研究揭示了继承参数作为通用知识载体的作用，识别了增强其在目标任务中有利影响的关键因素，并解释了参数迁移在某些情况下效果不佳的原因。

Conclusion: 该研究为部分参数迁移提供了理论依据，阐明了参数迁移有效性的关键条件，对迁移学习实践具有指导意义。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 激活导向技术通过向LLM隐藏状态添加语义向量来控制模型行为，但研究发现这会系统性破坏模型的安全对齐机制，使模型更容易响应有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活导向技术是否真的比微调更安全，以及这种精确控制模型内部状态的方法是否能确保对模型行为的精确控制。

Method: 在不同模型家族上进行广泛实验，包括随机方向导向、使用稀疏自编码器提取的良性特征导向，以及组合多个随机向量创建通用攻击。

Result: 随机方向导向使有害请求的遵从概率从0%增加到2-27%；使用SAE良性特征导向进一步增加2-4%；组合20个随机向量可创建通用攻击，显著提高对未见请求的有害遵从率。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通过可解释性实现安全的范式，表明对模型内部的精确控制并不能保证对模型行为的精确控制。

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply
with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model
families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出NL-SME方法，通过非线性参数轨迹建模显著提升联邦学习中梯度反转攻击的效果，相比现有线性方法有数量级改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护原始数据隐私，但梯度反转攻击构成严重威胁。现有基于线性假设的代理模型方法严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特性，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，在余弦相似度损失上实现数量级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range

challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce
SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency
and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting
the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，但忽视了追索建议的时间动态特性，特别是在竞争性、资源受限环境中，建议会影响未来申请者群体。

Method: 引入基于强化学习的追索算法，显式建模候选人群对建议的适应性反应，生成在时间范围T内保持有效的可行建议。

Result: 在复杂模拟环境中的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在可行性和长期有效性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计至关重要，提出的框架能够生成既可行又持久的追索建议。

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为latent MMHC的混合结构学习方法，用于学习混合类型变量之间的有向关系，并在女子排球运动员数据集上构建心理特质网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理属性很少孤立运作，教练需要理解相关特质之间的网络关系。现有方法难以处理混合类型变量（序数问卷分数、分类人口统计、连续指标）之间的有向关系。

Method: 引入latent MMHC方法，结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于分数的精炼返回单个有向无环图(DAG)。还研究了自举聚合变体以提高稳定性。

Result: 在模拟中，latent MMHC在结构汉明距离和边召回率方面优于最近的copula-based学习方法，同时保持高特异性。在排球数据中，学习到的网络围绕目标设定和自信心组织心理技能，情绪唤醒连接动机和焦虑，Big-Five特质位于技能集群的上游。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动中的心理特质分析提供了一个可解释的、数据驱动的框架，并为运动员发展提供决策支持。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性机器学习挑战了训练和部署期间数据分布一致的假设。在回归场景中，现有的悲观双层优化方法尚未应用，而该方法在分类场景中已被证明能有效建模对抗性威胁。

Method: 提出了一种悲观双层优化程序，专门针对回归场景设计，不假设攻击者最优策略的凸性或唯一性，能够捕捉对抗性的对抗本质。

Result: 该方法扩展了悲观双层优化的应用范围，从分类问题延伸到回归问题，为回归模型提供了更强的对抗性防御能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的悲观双层优化框架为回归场景中的对抗性规避攻击提供了有效的建模和防御手段，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了D³S框架，通过动态双级降采样策略优化无critic方法的策略学习效率，在样本级和token级分别选择信息量最大的数据，结合动态调度机制实现快速收敛和良好泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无critic方法（如GRPO）因使用大量无信息样本和token导致收敛缓慢的问题，通过优先选择信息量最大的样本和token来提高策略优化效率。

Method: D³S框架包含两个层级：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集，token级选择优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token。采用动态降采样调度，从激进降采样逐步过渡到宽松采样。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的实验表明，D³S集成到先进RL算法中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D³S框架通过动态双级降采样有效解决了无critic方法的收敛缓慢问题，在减少数据需求的同时提升了策略优化效率和泛化性能。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型，有效应对高缺失率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL框架区分生命体征和实验室测试两种变量类型：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕捉时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL能够有效处理真实临床场景中常见的高缺失率问题，为不规则采样的生理时间序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双切片Wasserstein距离(DSW)，作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein(WoW)距离的稳定且高效替代方案，通过利用1维Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间的等距性来避免高阶矩的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖于参数化元测度或高阶矩的存在，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定且计算高效的替代方案来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1维Wasserstein空间与函数空间L2([0,1])中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1维元测度的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: 数值实验在数据集、形状和图像上验证了DSW作为WoW距离的可扩展替代方案的有效性，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。

Conclusion: DSW最小化在离散化元测度情况下等价于WoW最小化，同时避免了不稳定的高阶矩问题，提供了计算效率更高的解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

Motivation: 向量量化在现代机器学习中广泛应用，但非可微的量化步骤阻碍了梯度反向传播。现有平滑方法通常分别处理紧密逼近和码本利用两个需求，需要一种能同时满足这两个要求的简单方法。

Method: 引入一种简单直观的正则化方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近邻平滑量化器之间的距离，同时促进紧密逼近和码本利用。

Result: 在离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习等基准测试中，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用，并相比先前方法提升了性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法能够同时满足向量量化平滑的两个关键需求，在多个任务中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型推理需求增长，半结构化(N:M)剪枝技术受到关注。虽然权重剪枝已成熟，但激活剪枝在动态输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销方面潜力巨大，却研究不足。

Method: 采用后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，评估轻量级即插即用误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立硬件友好的基线方法，探索超越标准2:4的稀疏模式。

Result: 激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力，16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但8:16模式在灵活性和硬件实现复杂度之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了有效的激活剪枝实践方法，并激励未来硬件支持更灵活的稀疏模式，8:16模式是优越的候选方案。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配方法无法有效处理数据异构问题。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT基于邻居服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失动态分配权重，优先考虑具有多样化信息的服务器。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种聚合方案，与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容，具有广泛的集成潜力。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效发现数据中的对称性并构建简化的等变模型，在多个任务中表现出色，为对称性学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

*Stefan Matthes,Zhiwei Han,Hao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于机制独立性的统一框架，通过潜在因子如何作用于观测变量而非其分布来实现解耦表示，并建立了多种独立性准则的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦表示旨在恢复观测数据背后的潜在变化因子，但其可识别性尚未完全理解。现有方法通常依赖潜在分布的统计假设，而本文寻求不依赖统计假设的解耦表示识别条件。

Method: 引入机制独立性框架，提出从支撑集、稀疏性到高阶条件的多种独立性准则，通过图论将潜在子空间表征为连通分量，证明这些准则在非线性、不可逆混合下仍能保证子空间可识别性。

Result: 建立了不同独立性准则之间的层次关系，证明了在机制独立性框架下，即使潜在因子存在统计依赖，也能识别解耦表示的潜在子空间。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了不依赖统计假设时解耦表示可识别的条件，为理解解耦表示的理论基础提供了新视角。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KReTTaH是一种基于回归的可解释多路数据插补框架，采用核回归和张量列分解，通过Hadamard过参数化实现参数效率，并在黎曼流形上进行学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多路数据中缺失值插补问题，特别是动态图流估计，需要灵活结合图结构先验并保持参数效率。

Method: 采用非参数化核回归框架，使用固定张量列秩的张量实现参数效率，通过Hadamard过参数化促进稀疏性，在黎曼流形上求解光滑逆问题。

Result: 在真实世界图数据集上的数值测试表明，KReTTaH在缺失时间变化边流插补方面持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个有效且灵活的多路数据插补框架，特别适用于结合图结构先验的动态图流估计任务。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a
neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

*Mu Huang,Linning Xu,Mingyue Dai,Yidi Shao,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了可逆图网络模拟器（R-GNS），这是一个统一框架，在单一图架构中强制执行双向一致性，用于耗散流体系统的正向和逆向模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体动力学中，模拟物理上合理的轨迹朝向用户定义的目标是一个基本但具有挑战性的任务。基于粒子的模拟器可以高效地再现正向动力学，但逆向推理仍然困难，特别是在耗散系统中，动力学是不可逆的，基于优化的求解器速度慢、不稳定且经常无法收敛。

Method: 提出基于残差可逆消息传递的数学可逆设计，具有共享参数，将正向动力学与逆向推理耦合，以提供准确的预测和高效恢复合理的初始状态。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试（Water-3D、WaterRamps和WaterDrop）上，R-GNS实现了更高的准确性和一致性，参数数量仅为四分之一，逆向推理速度比基于优化的基线方法快100倍以上。在正向模拟中，R-GNS与强大的GNS基线速度相当，而在目标条件任务中，它消除了迭代优化并实现了数量级的速度提升。

Conclusion: 这是第一个统一耗散流体系统正向和逆向模拟的可逆框架，能够通过生动、物理一致的轨迹实现复杂目标形状（如字符"L"和"N"）。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

Motivation: 研究大规模深度学习模型对训练数据的记忆现象，从数据重建角度分析模型参数与训练数据之间的关系。

Method: 在随机特征模型中，当p >> dn时，特征空间中训练样本张成的子空间包含足够信息来识别输入空间中的个体样本，并提出基于优化的数据重建方法。

Result: 提出的重建方法在多种架构（随机特征、两层全连接网络、深度残差网络）上都表现良好，验证了当p超过dn阈值时能重建整个训练数据集。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建的基本规律：当模型参数数量超过数据维度与样本数的乘积时，整个训练数据集可以从模型参数中恢复出来。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，通过参数学习揭示底层单参数子群Hγ。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效发现SO(n)的单参数子群，在多个应用领域展现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

Motivation: 现实世界中的顺序决策问题需要公平性保障，但性能与公平性的权衡难以预先确定，因此需要能够探索多种权衡方案的算法框架。

Method: 提出了扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，明确编码个体和群体信息，并在此基础上形式化了顺序决策问题中的公平概念，构建了计算时间维度公平度量的框架。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测两个场景中，该框架学习到的策略在多个场景下更加公平，仅带来轻微的性能损失。同时发现群体公平和个体公平并不必然相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不同问题设置中应用，为利益相关者提供可获得的性能-公平权衡信息，帮助他们选择最合适的策略。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

TL;DR: 提出了ASSESS框架，通过结合语义和结构信息来评估形式化语句相似度，并引入了TransTED相似度度量方法和EPLA评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的形式化语句相似度评估方法无法平衡语义和结构信息，字符串方法忽略语义，证明方法无法提供分级相似度评分。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获语法结构，然后使用TransTED相似度度量（增强的树编辑距离，通过变换融入语义感知）计算相似度得分。

Result: 在EPLA基准测试中，TransTED相似度优于现有方法，达到最先进准确率和最高Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合了语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似度评估提供了连续评分，在EPLA基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能可靠地擦除目标知识，在两种实际重训练场景下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Spectral Uncertainty的新方法，利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵来量化和分解LLMs中的不确定性，将总不确定性分为固有的数据模糊性（偶然不确定性）和模型局限性（认知不确定性）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取其预测不确定性的可靠度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有模糊性的偶然不确定性和仅来自模型局限性的认知不确定性，以有效应对每种不确定性来源。

Method: 利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，提供严格的理论基础将总不确定性分解为偶然和认知成分。与现有基线方法不同，该方法结合了语义相似性的细粒度表示，能够在模型响应中对各种语义解释进行细致区分。

Result: 实证评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计各种模型和基准数据集上的偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty为LLMs中的不确定性量化和分解提供了一种新颖有效的方法，在区分和估计不同类型的不确定性方面表现出色。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器为无线语义通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够更好地学习语义到真实分布的映射，解决了传统方法的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略和细化策略，在多个基准测试中优于现有划分器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优和划分质量不足的问题，特别是在大规模数据和加权顶点集上的划分挑战。

Method: 采用多目标非凸约束松弛模型，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成k维顶点特征。针对不同数据规模设计两种MST策略：小规模数据使用Prim算法构建最小生成树后剪枝聚类；大规模数据选择代表性节点子集构建小MST。引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，相比KaHyPar在2、3、4路划分中平均减少2%-5%的割集大小，特定实例提升达35%。在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart等先进划分器。细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现突出，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统的高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题。现有效率优化技术（如蒸馏）可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer），使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；引入IIAD（迭代影响感知蒸馏）技术，通过灵活阈值平衡性能与效率。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比原始Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%。高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保持99.4%原始准确率。最有效变体在可比速度下比原始Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET通过简化高阶方法实现了性能提升与效率优化的平衡，IIAD蒸馏技术提供了灵活的性能-效率权衡方案，为ODE-based Transformer架构提供了更优的优化路径。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效利用多模态领域知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的跨域泛化能力，支持零样本推理，为多模态时间序列基础模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家细粒度剪枝和高效二阶信息计算，成功解决了MoE模型内存需求高的问题，实现了高性能压缩。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出EPO框架解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体的探索-利用级联失败问题，通过熵正则化、熵平滑和自适应权重机制，在ScienceWorld和ALFWorld上分别实现152%和19.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮稀疏奖励环境中，LLM智能体面临探索-利用级联失败：早期策略过早收敛到低熵策略，后期熵正则化反而导致策略崩溃和训练不稳定。

Method: EPO框架包含三个协同机制：(1)多轮设置中的熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3)自适应阶段权重平衡训练中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现最高152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升，分析证明EPO能保证熵方差单调递减同时保持收敛。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL根本不同的熵控制方法，EPO框架为LLM智能体训练提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，同时保留先验知识。

Result: APB相比标准RL提升了样本效率，并能适应现有元RL基线通常失败的分布外任务。

Conclusion: APB通过参数高效微调机制有效解决了强化学习在任务不匹配情况下的适应性问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持竞争力，随着教师层加载准确率逐步提升，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的情况下提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化能力和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，在SFT之前作为预备步骤，让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式并激励类似ICL的内部推理过程。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实验表明，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口，表明ICL和SFT通过不同的功能机制实现适应。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致深度持续学习中可塑性丧失的关键因素，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实复现事件时间分布并保持删失机制。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion

TL;DR: 本文研究了环境上下文学习(ICEL)，从零样本性能转向关注世界模型的增长和渐近极限，提出了环境识别和环境学习两个核心机制，并推导了误差上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在面对新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，需要研究能够自适应环境变化的世界模型。

Method: 形式化了世界模型的上下文学习，识别了两个核心机制(环境识别和环境学习)，推导了误差上界，并通过实验验证了ICL机制的存在。

Result: 实证确认了世界模型中存在不同的ICL机制，并发现数据分布和模型架构以符合理论的方式影响ICL。

Conclusion: 这些发现展示了自适应世界模型的潜力，并突出了ICEL出现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

TL;DR: 提出随机激活策略，在LLM的前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的优化问题，并在预训练和生成中取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时利用RELU的稀疏性优势来减少推理计算量。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用随机激活（SILU或RELU的伯努利选择），在微调和推理阶段使用RELU；在生成任务中直接使用随机激活策略。

Result: 预训练+微调方案比直接使用RELU训练效果更好，推理时CPU速度显著提升；生成任务中性能接近最佳确定性非线性方法，同时能增加文本多样性。

Conclusion: 随机激活策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，在保持性能的同时实现了推理加速和生成多样性控制。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

TL;DR: 该论文通过离散几何视角研究神经网络特征几何，发现非线性激活在塑造前馈神经网络特征几何中起关键作用，特征几何演化类似于离散Ricci流，并提出基于几何的早停启发式和网络深度选择准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在各个领域取得了经验成功，但我们对神经特征表示的理解仍然不完整。本研究旨在通过离散几何的视角来研究神经特征几何。

Method: 使用编码局部相似性结构的几何图来近似输入数据流形，提供训练过程中这些图演化的理论结果，并在20,000多个前馈神经网络上进行实验验证。

Result: 发现非线性激活在前馈神经网络特征几何塑造中起关键作用，几何变换类似于离散Ricci流，类可分性的出现对应于相关图表示中社区结构的出现。

Conclusion: 提出基于离散Ricci流动态的局部评估几何变换的新框架，并建议实用的设计原则，包括几何启发的早停启发式和网络深度选择准则。

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

TL;DR: 研究探索大型音频语言模型（LALMs）生成思维链（CoT）的忠实性，通过多种干预方法在SAKURA和MMAR数据集上测试，发现LALMs的CoT通常能忠实反映其决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本LLMs的思维链往往不忠实，但音频语言模型的忠实性问题尚未被探索。由于LALMs需要先从音频中提取线索再进行推理，其忠实性对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预方法：转述、填充词注入、提前回答和引入错误，在SAKURA和MMAR两个推理数据集上进行测试。

Result: 实验表明，经过多种干预后，LALMs生成的思维链普遍能忠实反映其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，大型音频语言模型产生的思维链通常是忠实的，这对安全敏感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦多模态钓鱼网站检测器，支持URL、HTML和IMAGE输入，采用基于角色的桶聚合方法，通过硬门控选择模态专家，实现稳定的联邦训练和灵活的多模态检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的钓鱼检测方法通常绑定客户端到固定模态，限制了灵活性和可用性。需要在保护隐私的前提下，支持客户端任意调用不同模态的检测器。

Method: 在FedProx基础上提出角色感知桶聚合，受MoE和FedMM启发。使用硬门控选择模态专家（IMAGE/HTML/URL），分别聚合模态特定参数以避免跨嵌入冲突。URL使用GraphCodeBERT，HTML使用早期三路嵌入。

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish(HTML)达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率；TR-OP(原始HTML)达到95.1%准确率和4.6%误报率。

Conclusion: 基于硬门控专家的桶聚合方法能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and
flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在信用风险评估中面临高维数据、可解释性差、罕见事件检测和多类别不平衡等挑战，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出综合元学习框架，整合XGBoost、随机森林、支持向量机、决策树等监督学习方法，K近邻等无监督方法，多层感知机等深度学习架构，LASSO正则化进行特征选择，以及纠错输出码作为元分类器处理不平衡多类别问题。

Conclusion: 该元学习框架为信用风险建模提供了更准确可靠的解决方案，有助于改进战略金融决策支持。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在实际应用中广泛使用，但其内部结构和复杂性使其通常不易解释。模型透明度和可解释性是许多场景的关键要求，仅靠高性能不足以采用所提出的解决方案。

Method: 将L0正则化的可微分近似应用于多层逻辑感知器(MLLP)，并与随机二值化等替代启发式方法进行比较，以确定基于损失函数稀疏化网络是否能比基于随机分布的方法获得更好结果。

Result: 研究了CRS复杂性与性能之间的权衡关系，比较了不同稀疏化方法的效果。

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的稀疏化技术相比随机方法可以获得更好的结果，在保持模型性能的同时有效降低概念规则集的复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了SpinGPT，这是首个针对三人扑克游戏Spin & Go的大语言模型，通过监督微调和强化学习训练，在多人不完全信息游戏中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中计算复杂度呈指数增长，且纳什均衡在三人及以上游戏中不能保证不输结果，限制了其在流行锦标赛格式中的应用。受LLM在棋类游戏中成功的启发，希望探索LLM处理多人不完全信息游戏的新方法。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。

Result: SpinGPT在78%的决策中与求解器行动一致（容忍准确率）。使用简单的深筹码启发式，在3万手牌中对战Slumbot达到13.4±12.9 BB/100的胜率（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: 结果表明LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法，为CFR算法在多人游戏中的局限性提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Motivation: 利率下降和经济稳定化提高了死亡率预测的重要性，特别是在保险和养老金市场。多步预测对公共卫生、人口规划和保险风险评估至关重要，但在数据有限时面临挑战。

Method: 使用混合系统结合统计和机器学习模型处理线性和非线性模式，评估了三种多步预测方法（递归、直接和多输入多输出）以及不同ML模型的影响。

Result: 基于12个数据集和21个模型的实验结果显示，ARIMA-LSTM混合模型使用递归方法在大多数情况下优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 多步预测方法和机器学习模型的选择对提高混合系统性能至关重要。

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

Motivation: 解决机器人视觉强化学习中奖励设计的瓶颈问题，传统基于目标位置距离的奖励设计在真实视觉环境中因感知限制而不可行。

Method: 使用关键点从图像中隐式推断空间距离，学习预测模型作为规划器提出中间子目标，在分层强化学习框架下训练目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习过程，并优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ReLAM通过自动生成结构化奖励，有效解决了视觉强化学习中的奖励设计问题，提高了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: MoveFM-R是一个结合移动基础模型和大型语言模型的新框架，通过语义增强位置编码、渐进式课程学习和交互式自反机制，解决地理坐标与语言词汇不匹配的问题，显著提升人类移动轨迹生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动基础模型在建模人类移动模式方面面临数据规模和语义理解的限制，而大型语言模型虽然具有强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏对时空统计的固有理解。需要结合两者的优势来生成物理上合理的移动轨迹。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：语义增强位置编码来弥合地理与语言之间的差距；渐进式课程学习来对齐LLM推理与移动模式；交互式自反机制用于条件轨迹生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoveFM-R显著优于现有的基于MFM和LLM的基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFM的统计能力与LLM的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个新的范式，实现了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模开辟了新的数据驱动路径，能够高效预测复杂流动行为

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

Motivation: 现有GPL方法存在两个关键问题：(1)缺乏对底层机制的共识，不同提示策略在模型的不同空间进行干预；(2)场景适应性有限，难以泛化到数据分布变化的下游场景。

Method: 提出UniPrompt方法，通过理论分析发现表示级提示本质上等同于微调简单下游分类器，因此应该专注于释放预训练模型的能力，让分类器适应下游场景。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应该专注于释放预训练模型的能力，UniPrompt方法通过保持输入图结构实现了这一目标，在各种场景下都表现出良好的适应性。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过不频繁的全局同步和多次本地更新来减少通信，但其效率仍有提升空间。

Method: 每个节点在本地步骤中只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结，同时保持完整的正向传播以避免跨节点激活交换。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下与现有低通信方法达到相同的困惑度，同时减少了训练FLOPs和峰值内存。

Conclusion: 该方法通过限制反向传播实现了更高效的低通信分布式训练，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained

### [426] [Learning from Delayed Feedback in Games via Extra Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22426)
*Yuma Fujimoto,Kenshi Abe,Kaito Ariu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究解决了博弈学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 博弈学习中多个智能体独立学习策略时会出现优化差异，而时间延迟会阻碍对未来奖励的预测，降低OFTRL算法的性能。

Method: 提出WOFTRL算法，对OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量进行n次加权，当乐观权重超过时间延迟时能抵消延迟影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式博弈中实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和博弈中策略收敛到纳什均衡。

Conclusion: WOFTRL能有效解决博弈学习中的时间延迟问题，理论结果得到实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

TL;DR: 提出Flood复形来解决大规模点云数据持久同调计算中的计算瓶颈问题，相比传统方法能处理数百万点的数据，并在物体分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vietoris-Rips复形在计算大规模欧几里得点云数据的持久同调时面临指数级复杂度问题，即使使用Alpha复形或稀疏Rips近似仍会产生过多单纯形，限制了在大规模点云上的应用。

Method: 引入Flood复形，灵感来自Alpha和Witness复形。在给定过滤值r下，包含点云小子集Delaunay三角剖分中所有被半径为r的球完全覆盖的单纯形，称为"淹没"过程。该方法支持GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上的扩展实验表明，该方法能计算多达数百万点的二维持久同调。在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中，对几何或拓扑复杂的物体，性能优于其他基于持久同调的方法和点云神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood复形为大规模点云数据的持久同调计算提供了高效解决方案，证明了在处理复杂几何和拓扑对象时，这种扩展能力是必要的，且性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经ODE因其连续性和参数共享效率而成功，但这些特性也带来了梯度计算精度和收敛分析的挑战，需要研究激活函数的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析激活函数的平滑性和非线性特性，结合数值实验验证，研究其对前向和后向ODE解唯一性及神经切核谱性质的影响。

Result: 平滑激活函数保证前后向ODE解的全局唯一性，充分非线性维持神经切核的谱性质，在过参数化条件下实现梯度下降的全局收敛。

Conclusion: 激活函数的平滑性和非线性是神经ODE训练成功的关键，理论结果为实际应用提供了指导，有望实现更快的训练和更好的性能。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静电生成模型如PFGM++在图像合成中表现出色，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟生成样本，计算成本高

Method: 将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配，并推导出可处理的训练目标

Result: IPFM生成蒸馏后的生成器，仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近甚至优于教师模型的样本质量，且有限D值下的蒸馏收敛更快

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏方法，有限D值的PFGM++模型具有更优的优化和采样特性

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

TL;DR: PIGNN-Attn-LS结合边缘感知注意力机制和回溯线搜索全局校正，显著提升物理信息图神经网络在AC潮流计算中的精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)在精度上仍需改进，特别是在推理时物理损失失效，这阻碍了其在电力系统运行中的实际应用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS方法：1) 边缘感知注意力机制通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性，捕捉电网各向异性；2) 基于回溯线搜索的全局校正算子在推理时恢复有效下降准则。

Result: 在4-32节点高压电网测试中，电压和相角测试RMSE分别为0.00033 p.u.和0.08°，比PIGNN-MLP基线分别提升99.5%和87.1%。流式微批次推理在4-1024节点电网上比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合物理感知注意力机制和全局校正，实现了高精度和快速推理，为电力系统运行提供了可靠的AC潮流求解器。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Motivation: 传统优化方法将神经网络的所有中间变量和约束暴露给优化器，导致求解效率低下。本文旨在通过减少优化器处理的变量数量来提高求解速度。

Method: 采用缩减空间公式化方法，将神经网络视为"灰盒"，仅优化输入输出变量，中间变量和约束在GPU上并行计算。

Result: 在MNIST图像分类器的对抗生成和电力系统安全约束最优潮流两个问题上验证，相比全空间公式化方法，求解速度更快，迭代次数更少。

Conclusion: 缩减空间公式化方法能有效加速基于神经网络的优化问题求解，特别适合GPU并行计算场景。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法依赖人工增强或复杂生成目标，且主要使用2D拓扑信息，未能充分利用有价值的3D结构信息。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-nets作为建模单元，通过预测子图嵌入与其互补邻域的关系来学习表示，结合几何和拓扑信息于混合GNN-Transformer架构中。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，C-FREE在MoleculeNet上超越对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示能有效迁移到新化学领域，证明了3D结构信息在分子表示学习中的重要性。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Koopman算子作为非线性动力系统的线性表示，在多个科学领域受到关注。但基于核的Koopman算法存在两个普遍问题：计算复杂度高（稀疏性问题）和需要超参数优化与字典学习。

Method: 将Koopman算子理论与再生核希尔伯特空间概念结合，并引入高斯过程方法来缓解这些问题。通过高斯过程回归与动态模态分解的统一，减少计算需求并提高对传感器噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法不仅降低了计算需求，还展示了对传感器噪声的改进鲁棒性。同时解决了超参数优化和字典学习问题，使模型能更好地适应动力系统。

Conclusion: 主要贡献在于统一了高斯过程回归和动态模态分解，为基于核的Koopman算子方法提供了更实用和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中部署的大型语言模型需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、受版权保护材料或过时信息），而无需从头重新训练，以确保合规性、用户隐私和安全性。现有方法通过标量化将多目标问题简化为单目标问题，但常导致训练不稳定和模型效用下降。

Method: 提出OFMU框架，采用基于惩罚的双层优化：内层最大化通过相似性感知惩罚来强制遗忘，外层最小化恢复效用。开发具有收敛保证的两环算法，并在凸和非凸情况下进行理论分析。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中的广泛实验表明，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面始终优于现有遗忘方法。

Conclusion: OFMU通过分层结构明确优先考虑遗忘同时保持保留，在遗忘效果和模型效用之间实现了更好的权衡，为解决机器遗忘问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as

Conclusion: 本文填补了双乐观方法经验成功与理论基础之间的关键空白，为其提供了坚实的理论支撑。

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模连续和离散过程对于构建现实且可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要，JointDiff框架有效统一了这两种过程。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了无需参数更新的动态多任务适应，为EEG建模提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,

*Liangyu Ding,Chenghan Wu,Guokai Li,Zizhuo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用图卷积网络(GCN)解决组合定价问题，通过图表示混合捆绑模型，训练GCN学习最优捆绑模式，提出两种推理策略和局部搜索技术，在中小规模问题上达到97%以上的近最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合定价是收益管理中的经典问题，但由于候选组合数量呈指数级增长，通常难以求解。本文探索使用GCN来解决这一棘手问题。

Method: 首先开发混合捆绑模型的图表示，训练GCN学习最优捆绑的潜在模式，提出两种推理策略推导高质量可行解，并使用局部搜索技术进一步提高解的质量。

Result: 在5个产品的实例上训练的GCN，对于中小规模问题能以仅一小部分计算时间实现97%以上的近最优解。对于更大规模问题，相比其他启发式方法如捆绑规模定价(BSP)获得更优解，即使在产品效用非加性的挑战性情况下，对超过30个产品的问题也能提供高质量解。

Conclusion: 提出的GCN框架在解决组合定价问题上表现出高效性和有效性，能够处理传统方法难以解决的大规模和非加性效用问题。

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

### [441] [Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562)
*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中塑性损失的关键因素，作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐失去适应能力（塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，引入两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量基准和非平稳MuJoCo强化学习环境中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，经过深思熟虑的激活函数设计能够在不需要额外容量或任务特定调整的情况下，持续保持持续学习中的塑性。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的方法，可以在持续学习中维持模型的可塑性。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

*Davide Tenedini,Riccardo Zamboni,Mirco Mutti,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，将高维策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，通过行为重构损失训练生成模型，使潜在空间按功能相似性而非参数邻近性组织，显著提高深度强化学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低下，主要原因是直接在冗余的高维参数空间中优化策略，这在多任务设置中问题更加严重。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重构损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性组织，然后在潜在空间中进行策略梯度优化。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力，学习到的流形支持在潜在空间中进行任务特定适应。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了深度强化学习的样本效率，证明了策略参数空间的内在维度取决于环境复杂性而非网络大小，为多任务学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捷克东北部是地震活跃区，既有构造地震也有采矿诱发地震，尽管采矿活动已停止，但采矿诱发地震仍会发生。快速区分不同类型的地震事件对监测和预警很重要。

Method: 使用Frenštát地震多边形（SPF）数据集，应用长短期记忆循环神经网络（LSTM）和XGBoost等机器学习方法进行二元分类。

Result: LSTM和XGBoost在二元分类任务中取得了0.94-0.95的F1分数，表明现代机器学习技术在地震事件快速表征方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效区分构造地震和采矿诱发地震，为快速地震事件表征提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决传统采样方法低估性能方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIL评估协议仅从少量随机采样序列计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整性能范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。需要更稳健的评估方法来准确表征整个性能分布。

Method: 提出EDGE评估协议，引入极端序列概念，利用任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关关系，自适应识别和采样极端类别序列来逼近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，更准确地估计分布边界，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可操作见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列采样提供了更可靠的CIL评估框架，能够更全面地反映模型在不同类别序列下的性能变化。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样策略的Mean Flow框架，用于改进单步生成模型，在保持快速推理的同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成模型虽然效果好但推理速度慢，Mean Flow虽然能实现单步生成但无法忠实逼近原始多步流匹配过程。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Result: 在低维控制设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换、点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了Mean Flow在连续域中逼近多步流匹配过程的局限性，实现了既快速又高质量的生成效果。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线来解决强化学习中熵崩溃和熵爆炸的问题，实现稳定的训练和持续的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均值的价值无关强化学习方法在奖励异常值下会不当惩罚负优势样本，导致训练在熵崩溃和熵爆炸之间振荡。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败。

Result: QAE稳定了熵变化，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式）是扩展强化学习与可验证奖励的主要机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Motivation: DFM是一个有前景的离散生成建模框架，通过训练神经网络来近似变换速度场来学习底层生成动态。本文旨在为其提供严格的理论保证。

Method: 通过分解最终分布估计误差，分析学习速度场的风险，包括近似误差（Transformer架构表示真实速度的能力）和估计误差（有限数据集训练的统计收敛率）。

Result: 证明了生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离受学习速度场风险控制，并给出了该风险的边界分析。

Conclusion: 首次正式证明了训练后的DFM模型生成的分布会随着训练集规模增加而收敛到真实数据分布。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Method: 将启发式学习建模为约束优化问题，引入CEA损失函数在训练中强制可容许性；利用PDB抽象和图结构特性分析样本复杂度；使用ReLU神经网络提供泛化保证。

Result: 在魔方问题上，该方法产生了接近可容许的启发式函数，其引导能力显著强于压缩PDB启发式；理论分析给出了A*算法泛化所需的训练样本数量界限。

Conclusion: CEA方法能够学习接近可容许的高质量启发式函数，同时理论分析为启发式学习的泛化性能提供了保证，特别是针对目标依赖启发式函数提供了首个泛化保证。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，识别并缓解因提示泄露和推理泄露导致的性能虚高问题，通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略来更准确地评估监控器检测模型真实行为的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测大型语言模型有害行为方面具有优势，但训练和评估过程中目标行为的提示信息会泄露到监控器数据中，导致性能评估虚高，需要区分监控器检测的是真实模型行为还是表面提示痕迹。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、提示蒸馏微调模型生物（训练模型在不显式提示下展现欺骗行为），并以欺骗检测为案例研究识别两种泄露形式。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤能平滑移除提示信号，使探针AUROC下降30%；分数过滤减少AUROC 15%；微调模型生物虽改善评估但使监控器性能下降高达40%，即使重新训练也是如此。

Conclusion: 现有监控器性能评估存在严重偏差，需要更严谨的评估方法来区分真实检测能力和对提示痕迹的依赖，提出的框架和策略能更准确地评估监控器的真实效能。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下有效对齐推理过程。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，EEG数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征，使用包括集成模型在内的传统机器学习模型和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 整体结果没有显著差异，但GNN模型在某些传统模型表现不佳的基础标准上普遍表现更好。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，研究提供了传统模型（如SVM）与较少使用的GNN模型在基于EEG的神经营销中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Method: 采用两层嵌套循环：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能体控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块（结构化地理空间知识库）注入地理学理论先验。

Result: 在地理插值任务中减少RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计任务中提升性能17%，消融研究证实领域知识引导的检索对稳定高质量进化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，通过整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，准确且可解释的生存分析在肿瘤学中仍然是一个核心挑战。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式，风险估计采用透明的Cox回归。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX实现了C-index 0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，MultiFIX框架与已知预后标志物一致。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

### [455] [Semantic F1 Scores: Fair Evaluation Under Fuzzy Class Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21633)
*Georgios Chochlakis,Jackson Trager,Vedant Jhaveri,Nikhil Ravichandran,Alexandros Potamianos,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic F1分数，一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。需要一种能够给予语义相关但不完全相同标签部分信用的评估方法。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，从中推导出Semantic F1分数。采用新颖的两步精度-召回公式，能够比较任意大小的标签集，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似的标签。

Result: 通过理论论证和在合成及真实数据上的广泛实证验证，Semantic F1显示出更好的可解释性和生态有效性。

Conclusion: Semantic F1提供了更公平的评估，承认类别重叠、标注者分歧以及基于相似预测的下游决策会产生相似结果。该方法仅需领域适当的相似度矩阵，适用于各种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Conclusion: 该研究为具身AI系统的物理安全评估提供了有效基准，并开发了可解释的安全推理方法，提升了模型在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，利用预训练ASR模型优化低资源语言的TTS系统，仅需少量配对数据即可生成高质量语音


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏配对文本-语音数据，但ASR模型相对容易获得，需要开发仅需少量数据的TTS适应方法

Method: 1) 用IPA训练多语言TTS基础模型；2) 用少量配对数据微调获取目标语言韵律特征；3) 应用GRPO，仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示，通过ASR、说话人验证和音频质量估计模型的多目标奖励进行优化

Result: 在低资源语言中生成可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于单独微调；在高资源语言中也优于DPO等方法，在可理解性、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用预训练ASR模型优化TTS系统，在低资源和高资源语言中都能产生高质量的语音合成效果

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT（Retrieval-of-Thought）通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤来构建动态模板，指导新问题的解决，从而减少推理模型的输出令牌数量、延迟和成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率。

Method: RoT将推理步骤组织成带有顺序和语义边的思维图，通过检索查询相关节点并应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定的模板，指导生成过程。

Result: RoT在多个模型和推理基准测试中，输出令牌减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索构建动态模板，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出LLR-BC框架，解决神经VRP求解器在终身学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过行为对齐和决策重要性加权来保持知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时存在零样本泛化能力差或微调导致灾难性遗忘的问题，需要开发终身学习能力。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策寻求方式对齐新旧任务的行为，并为低置信度决策分配更大权重来关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在多任务序列中持续学习和保持性能。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorzion基准测试，用于评估自主智能体在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现现有LLM智能体在这些任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大多关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、商业投资、科学发现）通常需要长视野和部分可观测环境下的持续能力，现有基准测试很少捕捉这些挑战。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中设计长视野发现任务，智能体必须通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理以及与环境交互来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用，标准配置下也超过35k token和60+工具调用。实验显示LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 发现智能体存在八种错误类型，主要归因于两个原因：上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距，简单的扩展方法在当前任务中失败。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对构建完整网页应用所需的关键能力（推理、鲁棒性、安全性）的全面评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含8个任务的基准测试，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM显示，模型在真实布局的组合推理、界面扰动下的鲁棒性以及安全关键操作识别方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 现有MLLM在网页理解的关键能力上存在显著差距，需要进一步改进推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力以支持端到端网页应用开发。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

<details>

Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更智能的决策框架。

Method: 采用思考-对齐-反思的认知循环框架，包含应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐（TAC检查和ACA）、执行后状态反思（SRA）等组件。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中达到最先进水平：AndroidWorld上75.8%的成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上96.8%的成功率。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架显著提升了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务上的能力，无需复杂轨迹数据集训练，具有强泛化性。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为通常无法获取真实轨迹或应用数据库，而静态轨迹的LLM-as-a-Judge方法准确率有限

Method: ProRe系统包含通用推理器和领域特定评估器。推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，评估器通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，使推理器能够分配更准确且可验证的奖励

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提升了5.3%和19.4%。与最先进的策略智能体集成后，成功率提升了22.4%

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互显著提升了GUI智能体的奖励评估准确性，为训练和评估大型语言模型提供了更有效的奖励机制

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个新颖的数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务通常涉及探索多个数据源并综合发现以提供有洞察力的答案，但LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成优化分析计划方面存在困难，因为验证计划充分性在没有真实标签的开放任务中具有挑战性。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个关键组件：(1) 数据文件分析模块，自动探索和提取多样数据格式的上下文；(2) 验证步骤，LLM评估每个阶段分析计划的充分性；(3) 顺序规划机制，从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直到验证充分。

Result: 实验显示DS-STAR在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code）上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要处理多个异构数据文件的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代优化方法能够可靠地导航涉及多样数据源的复杂分析，为自动化数据科学任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Motivation: 研究决策公理（如伦理约束）在决策建模中的应用，探索公理在决策制定和评估中的结构性属性和潜在冲突。

Method: 开发了一个决策公理建模框架，基于公理的结构特性定义分类法，分析决策-评估悖论的产生机制。

Result: 发现决策-评估悖论在实际公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了在决策制定和评估过程中应用公理的内在矛盾。

Conclusion: 决策-评估悖论强调了在训练决策模型和应用公理时需要格外谨慎，以避免公理在决策制定和评估中的不一致性。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的多智能体系统研究缺乏受控实验的原则性方法，限制了对其涌现行为的系统性分析。

Method: 开发Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特质）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个组件，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Result: 在10个任务的基准测试中验证了方法有效性，通过模拟美国关税冲击实验证明，只有当智能体的认知架构正确配置记忆和工具时，其行为才与观察到的市场反应一致。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个用于计算图表示学习的新范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，解决了传统图神经网络在建模计算功能时的架构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）和Transformer在图计算任务中存在架构不匹配，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性，这限制了模型对计算图功能行为的建模能力。

Method: 1. 使用层次化Transformer架构，模拟逐步计算流程，替代有缺陷的置换不变聚合；2. 提出函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测分解为仅预测函数偏移（真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异）。

Result: 在电子电路（最复杂且经济关键的计算图类别）的全面基准测试中，TRACE显著优于所有先前架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的骨干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更强大的学习图计算范式，为解决计算图表示学习的基本挑战提供了更稳健的方法。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业到达的频繁干扰，现有离线策略不完美，而在线规划因问题信息不完整易受扰动影响。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境走向既能产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升离线学习策略性能，在线规划时间增加可忽略，在各种调度场景中持续优于标准MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，而两种方法在可解释性方面都获得了专家认可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不清楚。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: 机器学习模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常值。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释机器学习在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，强调了可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策的重要性。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

TL;DR: CoBel-World是一个为LLM智能体设计的协作信念世界框架，通过显式建模协作者的意图状态来减少通信成本和提高任务效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理能力，导致计划不一致和通信冗余，降低协作效率

Method: 使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，主动检测潜在协调问题

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，通信成本减少22-60%，任务完成效率提高4-28%

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效、类人协作至关重要

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理中需要多步状态交互的复杂动态内容，需要专门解决方案。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集、RISK-Bench基准测试和RISK-R1强化微调框架，后者通过输出格式、单步、多步和任务四个层面的优化来提升性能。

Result: RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升6.8%，离线多步任务中提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网络交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电子商务风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒的根本原因，探索语言模型在关系知识表示和编辑方面的内在能力，证明反转诅咒可以通过改进表示学习来克服。

Method: 从头开始训练语言模型，使用合成的关系知识图谱数据集，分析隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 具有双线性关系结构的模型能够推断未见过的反向事实，并且模型编辑能够正确传播到相关事实，保持逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的底层表示几何结构，关系知识训练能够诱导双线性内部表示的出现。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体基准测试往往将智能推理与复杂数学推理、专业知识等能力混在一起，难以分离评估智能推理能力本身。需要构建一个专门评估智能推理的基准。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准，要求LLM解决小学数学问题但只提供问题不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出智能推理图概念来分析和可视化推理模式。

Result: 即使是GPT-5等前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上准确率也只有67%。发现模型普遍缺乏重新访问已访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: 提出的工具增强测试时缩放方法可以改善LLM的智能推理性能。GSM-Agent基准和智能推理框架有助于未来理解和推进智能推理边界的研究。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间存在显著差距，这种差距通常需要通过多个解决方案路径才能揭示。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：首先由"探索者"模型并行生成多个潜在解决方案，然后由"综合者"模型整合这些参考进行更精细的第二阶段推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（4B探索者+8B综合者）超越32B单体模型性能，成本降低30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，更是现实应用中的高效实用解决方案，展示了并行推理在提升模型能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 提出的广义问题公式化方法能够有效支持标准多目标搜索算法，通过适当扩展核心操作即可在各种机器人规划问题中实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM方法的脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性等问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 采用结构化两级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，低层规划通过解释实时GUI上下文将高层计划转化为具体动作序列，并结合用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法识别用户特定模式。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间显著改善，在长程任务序列中保持超过60.0%的成功率，证明其在复杂多步骤工作流中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，实现了鲁棒且可适应的GUI自动化，在复杂任务和UI变化下表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率指标直接处理分布，而非简单的多数投票聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性，标注者间存在分歧且置信度不一致，传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来明确处理标注不确定性，这些指标可独立于标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型）应用，计算轻量且具有线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布数据集的原始标注并采用不确定性感知评估，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: LLM能够在组合优化中产生更高效的解决方案，同时减少计算资源需求，为理解LLM在专业领域的评估做出了贡献。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域特定知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域提供更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，使用结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优状态跟踪能力，显著提升状态空间模型的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型中的转移矩阵虽然计算高效但表达能力受限，而无结构转移矩阵计算成本过高。需要找到平衡计算效率和表达能力的解决方案。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Result: 在FSA状态跟踪任务中显著优于多种现代SSM变体，在多类时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当，并能有效跟踪复杂FSA状态。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优状态跟踪能力，为状态空间模型提供了表达能力与计算成本的良好平衡。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，适用于任何黑盒LLM且无需修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实生成方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，要么没有字面解释LLM，要么没有按意图解释LLM。本文旨在提供基于LLM预期语义的更简单方法。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，而不是确定性因果模型。这种方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用，无需了解实现细节。

Result: 提出的方法比现有方法更简单，且能直接应用于任何黑盒LLM。现有方法虽然能直接生成特定类型的反事实，但适用范围有限。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM预期语义的反事实推理提供了理论基础，为开发面向特定应用的新型反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个多智能体推理框架，通过整合系统1（快速直觉思维）和系统2（缓慢深思思维）来增强LLM的推理能力，使开源模型在复杂推理任务上达到与闭源模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知的双过程理论启发，旨在模拟人类思维过程，提升LLM在复杂知识密集型推理任务中的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用多智能体设计：首先由快速思维智能体（系统1）生成快速答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体的系统2推理流程。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用LLaMA 3模型的PRIME框架在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，性能可与GPT-4和GPT-4o等最先进闭源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: PRIME为提升LLM在复杂知识密集型推理领域的表现提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，有效模拟了人类认知过程。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer框架进行文本控制的视觉编辑，生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频；采用AdaMix策略动态重加权训练批次，专注于感知或运动学上的困难样本。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面显著优于现有方法；在零样本视觉领域的真实机器人操作任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%，结合AdaMix后进一步提升13%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和有效的训练策略，显著提升了VLA模型在机器人操作任务中的泛化能力，为解决数据收集瓶颈提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Method: 引入ASAL++方法，使用第二个基础模型根据模拟视觉历史提出新的进化目标。探索两种策略：EST（每次迭代匹配单个新提示）和ETT（匹配整个生成提示序列）。在Lenia基质中使用Gemma-3进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，EST策略促进更大的视觉新颖性，而ETT策略培养更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为具有开放式特征的FM驱动ALife发现指出了新的方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Motivation: 现有方法将图表作为静态图像处理，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图操作模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调和带符号奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试上，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一层次决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架能够演化成通用的金字塔式多智能体系统，有效解决广泛领域的问题，显著提升了LLM智能体的可扩展性和执行效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Conclusion: TrueGradeAI通过结合手写保存与可扩展透明评估，在减少环境影响的同时积极缓解评分偏见，确保评估公平性。

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了REMA框架，通过分析推理流形（Reasoning Manifold）的几何结构来解释大语言模型推理失败的起源。该框架通过计算错误表示与正确表示形成的低维流形之间的空间偏差，定位推理链开始偏离的关键点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战。需要提供可测量的几何分析视角来揭示模型内部的计算过程。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架。通过计算错误表示与正确推理流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪各层偏差变化来定位推理链偏离点。

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，以及错误与正确推理表示之间的高度可分性。REMA框架能有效分析推理失败的起源。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解和诊断黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向："适应性利己主义者"和"利他优化者"，揭示了LLM在社会行为逻辑上的内在异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽略了大规模智能体社会中利他行为的涌现机制。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标间进行选择，并使用扎根理论方法系统编码智能体推理过程。

Result: 识别出两种原型：适应性利己主义者（默认优先考虑自身利益但在社会规范影响下增加利他行为）和利他优化者（固有地优先考虑集体利益）。

Conclusion: 社会模拟中的模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行为逻辑。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，而利他优化者更适合模拟理想化亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自进化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，结合策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型的协同进化，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统的判别式过程监督目光短浅，无法全面评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: StepORLM采用协同进化循环，策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型相互迭代改进。通过双重反馈机制：外部求解器的确定性结果验证和GenPRM的细致全面过程评估，使用加权直接偏好优化对齐策略并同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专用基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大的通用过程验证器，大幅提升自身模型和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化框架，有效解决了运筹学问题中LLM训练的关键挑战，展示了在较小模型规模下实现卓越性能的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的多模态交互编码框架，使用紧凑的令牌化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流程中会导致重复的质量下降，无法满足多模态双向交互的需求。

Method: 采用基于令牌的紧凑表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件三种设计）来最小化令牌间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻性的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Experts Search (DES)方法，通过动态控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样而忽略模型架构作用。在MoE模型中观察到改变激活专家数量可产生互补解集，这揭示了新的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：(1) Dynamic MoE - 在推理时直接控制专家数量生成多样化推理轨迹；(2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - 在推理路径内保持专家数量一致，在运行间变化，平衡稳定性和多样性。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES展示了架构感知TTS的实用性和可扩展性，说明现代LLMs的结构灵活性可以推进推理能力发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的理论机制，发现RL通过探索避免SFT的伪相关解，但策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，而Q学习能保持多样性并防止奖励破解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习显著提升了大型语言模型的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度和Q学习方法在规划任务中的表现，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT会产生基于共现的伪相关解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题，Q学习能保持输出多样性并防止奖励破解。

Conclusion: 探索是RL实现更好泛化的关键，Q学习在保持多样性和防止奖励破解方面优于策略梯度，合理的奖励设计对Q学习至关重要。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型缺乏对头发动态的细粒度控制，而头发模拟和渲染面临复杂的动力学、材料属性和光线交互等挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 用物理模拟器将物理参数编码为每帧几何；2) 提取每帧控制信号；3) 将控制信号输入视频扩散模型生成具有期望头发动态的视频。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个基于物理信息的视频扩散框架，实现了可控的动态效果，为头发渲染提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS系列模型在功耗受限的扩展现实（XR）设备上效率不足，这些设备需要在瓦特级别运行。

Method: 提出通用问题公式化，通过识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，并找到曲线上功耗最小的点（具有闭式解），同时支持注视点渲染以进一步节省功耗。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，与最先进的3DGS模型相比，PowerGS实现了高达86%的总功耗降低，主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是首个在质量约束下联合最小化3DGS渲染和显示功耗的框架，为XR设备提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Conclusion: DeformSplat框架能够从单张图像重建一致的变形，为受限场景下的变形重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.
