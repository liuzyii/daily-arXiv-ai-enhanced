### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS是一个紧凑的行为审计工具，用于评估视觉语言模型是否拒绝视觉矛盾的陈述，包含空间一致性分数(SCS)和错误同意率(IAR)两个指标。研究发现指令调优的生成式VLM表现较差，而对比编码器模型更为稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，降低实际应用中的可信度，因此需要开发能够测量模型拒绝视觉矛盾陈述能力的审计工具。

Method: 引入MATS行为审计工具，使用激活修补技术因果定位失败位置，包括生成式模型的跨注意力层和对比模型的池化投影组件。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLM(如LLaVA 1.5、QwenVLchat)表现出极低的SCS和高的IAR，而对比编码器(如CLIP、SigLIP)则更为稳健。

Conclusion: 通过激活修补技术可以因果定位模型失败的具体位置，为模型修复提供了具体路径，对比编码器在拒绝视觉矛盾陈述方面比生成式VLM表现更好。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，能够以亚像素精度联合估计两幅图像之间的尺度和旋转变化，通过傅里叶变换和对数极坐标结合互相关最大化策略实现精确配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准在医学成像和计算机视觉中至关重要，传统相位相关技术只能处理平移偏移，无法有效处理相机缩放或旋转引起的尺度和旋转变化。

Method: 基于对数极坐标中的傅里叶变换，结合互相关最大化策略和辅助函数方法，通过亚像素级互相关实现尺度和旋转的精确估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散互相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效解决图像配准中的尺度和旋转估计问题，具有较高的精度和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出强化学习框架，通过课程数据调度和难度感知过滤增强GRPO，提升多模态检测的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳

Method: 强化学习框架，结合课程数据调度和难度感知过滤来增强GRPO，使用KL正则化和奖励设计来稳定优化

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中检测准确性和鲁棒性显著提升，消融研究确认了奖励设计、KL正则化和课程调度的重要性

Conclusion: 强化驱动优化结合结构化数据课程是通往鲁棒可解释多模态检测的可扩展路径

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过拉普拉斯谱对齐、组件计数和邻接统计来约束半监督语义分割，在病理图像分割中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中像素级一致性方法传播噪声伪标签、产生碎片化或拓扑无效掩码的问题

Method: 集成图论约束，对齐预测图和参考图之间的拉普拉斯谱、组件计数和邻接统计

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上，使用5-10%监督实现最先进性能，显著缩小与全监督的差距

Conclusion: TGC通过强制执行全局拓扑约束，提高了分割准确性，是病理图像半监督分割的有效方法

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一篇关于行人重识别技术的综述，重点比较了监督学习和无监督学习方法的发展现状、性能差距和未来趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法虽然性能优越但依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性问题。无监督学习方法利用未标注数据，近年来性能显著提升，与监督学习的差距正在缩小，因此需要系统梳理这一领域的发展现状。

Method: 采用双焦点综述方法：一方面回顾和分类监督学习的代表性工作，分析其技术成熟度；另一方面重点探讨过去三年无监督学习的最新进展，识别新兴趋势。

Result: 监督学习技术已接近性能天花板，改进空间有限；无监督学习方法在性能上快速追赶，显示出与监督学习性能趋同的潜力。

Conclusion: 行人重识别领域正经历从监督学习向无监督学习的范式转变，无监督方法有望克服数据标注瓶颈，成为未来发展的主要方向。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法来解决Vision Mambas中token随图像分辨率二次增长的问题，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护机制，在显著减少token数量的同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas虽然具有次二次复杂度，但其效率仍受限于token随图像分辨率的二次增长。现有方法忽略了ViMs内在的有限方向序列依赖(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: STM包含两个核心组件：1）双向最近邻合并，通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖；2）隐藏状态保护，在类别token周围稳定隐藏状态。该方法利用Mamba的逐层损失收敛将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 实验显示STM在显著减少token数量时性能下降很小：ViM-Ti在减少20%token时准确率仅下降1.0%，ViM-S在减少40%token时仅下降1.4%。

Conclusion: STM在最小复杂度下实现了最先进的效率，同时为状态空间模型动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比学习框架的视觉语言模型，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅更新0.07%参数即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用CLIP风格对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络的体素级嵌入映射到冻结大型嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示，使用硬负样本和半硬负样本的对比损失。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上比单模态和多模态基线提升0.92%总体精度和1.60 Kappa系数，在Pavia University数据集上提升0.69%总体精度和0.90 Kappa系数，参数量比DCTN小50倍，比SS-TMNet小90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过极少的参数更新实现了高光谱图像场景理解的最先进性能，证明了在跨模态对齐中使用精心设计的对比学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法用于一次性联邦提示学习，通过注意力隔离和跨设备协作精炼模块，在保持跨任务泛化能力的同时实现通信高效的联邦学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，而一次性联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力，需要解决这一差距。

Method: GPR-NIAM包含两个核心模块：注意力隔离模块抑制可学习提示令牌对原始文本令牌的注意力，并重新加权反向注意力；跨设备协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识并校准全局提示。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过非干扰注意力掩码机制成功实现了一次性联邦提示学习，在保持通信效率的同时提升了跨任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中缺乏所有类别完整训练数据的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中，需要模型能够识别训练时未见过的物体类别。

Method: 在生成式零样本学习框架中，将混合专家层集成到生成器和判别器中，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成与真实特征相似的假特征。

Conclusion: 结合生成式零样本学习和混合专家的GZSL-MoE模型为复杂3D环境理解提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IBiT方法，通过引入学习掩码为Vision Transformers添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习而无需知识蒸馏


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏卷积神经网络的归纳偏置，这些偏置在大数据集上可学习，但在小数据集上表现不佳

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformers引入归纳偏置，创建IBiT模型

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持了Transformer的可解释性

Conclusion: 通过引入学习掩码的归纳偏置，Vision Transformers可以在小数据集上有效学习，无需依赖知识蒸馏

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理导致布局不真实，而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型预处理输入图像（分割、尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散合成符合场景图对象关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器渲染完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局连贯性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功地将视觉语言推理与组合扩散相结合，实现了更真实和语义一致的多对象场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLat3D是一个统一的3D资产生成框架，通过几何-外观统一VAE将几何和外观编码到单一潜在空间中，实现单阶段直接生成，解决了传统两阶段方法中的几何-纹理不对齐问题。

Motivation: 传统3D生成方法采用两阶段流程（先几何后外观），容易产生几何-纹理不对齐问题且成本高昂，需要更高效统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出几何-外观统一VAE，将高分辨率稀疏特征压缩为紧凑的UniLat潜在表示；基于此表示训练单一流匹配模型，直接从高斯噪声映射到UniLat。

Result: 在公开数据集上训练，UniLat3D能在数秒内从单张图像生成高质量3D资产，具有优越的外观保真度和几何质量。

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一的潜在表示和单阶段生成流程，显著提升了3D资产生成的效率和质量，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务。评估发现当前最先进模型在时间排序和空间关系方面存在系统性缺陷，甚至在基础计数和几何比较上也会出错。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但研究不足的能力，需要专门的基准来系统评估和诊断模型在这方面的表现。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务。基于两个辅助数据集TallyBench(2000张计数图像)和HistCaps(515张历史图像)构建。评估了闭源API(OpenAI、Gemini、Claude)和开源模型(Qwen2.5-VL和Qwen3-VL系列)。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但模型存在关键局限：即使最强模型也持续在时间排序和空间关系上失败，经常在人类看来简单的计数和几何比较上犯错。视觉比较是当前VLMs的系统性盲点。

Conclusion: CompareBench通过提供受控、多样化和诊断性评估，为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础，揭示了当前模型在视觉比较推理方面的系统性不足。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR是一种在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法，通过在统一的潜在向量空间中搜索来实现跨模态推理，无需微调高质量推理数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调，存在局限性。

Method: 在统一的潜在向量空间中联合推理图像和文本，通过策略梯度方法搜索离散图像和文本标记的向量表示，由图像质量评判器指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均达到最先进水平，在知识密集型WISE上总体得分0.63，比基线提高80%。

Conclusion: 在统一潜在空间中进行联合推理是MILR强大性能的关键，该方法在时间和文化推理方面展现出非凡能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UESA-Net是一种用于乳腺和甲状腺超声图像分割的U型网络，采用多方向收缩注意力机制，在TN3K和BUSI数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺和甲状腺癌症负担日益增加，超声成像虽然成本效益高，但存在斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱的问题。现有网络难以平衡高级语义与低级空间细节，需要开发能够弥合全局上下文与局部细节语义差距的分割框架。

Method: 提出UESA-Net，采用编码器-解码器架构。编码块中，注意力模块沿水平、垂直和深度方向操作以利用空间细节，收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征。解码器镜像编码器但应用成对收缩机制，结合先验低级物理线索与相应编码器特征来增强上下文建模。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上表现优异：TN3K数据集（3493张图像）IoU为0.8487，BUSI数据集（780张图像）IoU为0.6495，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过有效聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: PartCo是一个新的广义类别发现框架，通过引入部分级视觉特征对应关系来增强类别发现能力，能够无缝集成到现有GCD方法中并显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分紧密相关类别所需的关键部分级线索。

Method: 提出PartCo框架，利用部分级视觉特征对应关系来捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签和部分级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT是一种高效的文本到图像模型微调框架，通过将权重矩阵更新分解为两个可训练矩阵：在低秩子空间补集上的投影和低秩更新，实现了在个性化、多任务统一和可编辑性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像模型在高效微调中面临的挑战：如何在有限图像中学习新概念、保持多任务统一能力以及维持可编辑性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出分解式高效微调框架DEFT，将预训练权重矩阵更新分解为两个组件：使用单个可训练低秩矩阵定义子空间，另一个可训练低秩矩阵在该子空间内实现灵活参数适应。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus、InsDet和VisualCloze数据集上的实验表明，DEFT在个性化、对象场景适应和视觉上下文学习方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持模型可编辑性的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频生成评估方法局限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，或仅提供粗略分析，无法全面捕捉视频质量评估的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行强化学习，以增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: VideoScore2在内部基准VideoScore-Bench-v2上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个外部基准上平均性能达到50.37（提升4.32），同时提供可解释的评估结果。

Conclusion: VideoScore2通过有效的奖励建模为Best-of-N采样提供了可解释的评估，弥合了评估与可控生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

TL;DR: TRUST是一种新的测试时自适应方法，专门针对状态空间模型(SSMs)，通过利用多种遍历排列生成输入图像的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来指导参数更新，显著提升了在分布偏移下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型(SSMs)作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法，利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签更新Mamba特定参数，并通过权重平均整合不同遍历扫描中学到的信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST持续提升了鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的方法，有效解决了状态空间模型在分布偏移下的泛化问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

TL;DR: MMPB是首个用于评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准测试，包含10k图像-查询对和111个可个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四大类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉个性化在面向用户的AI系统中至关重要，但现有大型视觉语言模型在适应个体用户方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的MMPB基准测试，将个性化分为三种主要任务类型，使用23个广泛使用的视觉语言模型进行三阶段评估：概念注入、多轮对话和个性化查询。

Result: 大多数视觉语言模型在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在保持对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难。

Conclusion: MMPB揭示了视觉语言模型个性化面临的挑战（如拒绝行为和长上下文遗忘），为未来研究提供了有价值的见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的错误分类结果。该方法结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法大多依赖不切实际的白盒假设、非目标攻击目标或产生视觉上明显的补丁，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种能够同时确保真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性的攻击框架。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，实现语义感知的定位。攻击者可以自由选择输入图像和目标类别，精确控制错误分类结果。

Result: 在卷积网络（DenseNet-121、ResNet-50）和视觉变换器（ViT-B/16、Swin-B/16等）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到最先进性能，攻击成功率（ASR）和目标类别成功率（TCS）均持续超过99%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅超越了先前的白盒攻击和非目标基线，还优于产生可检测伪影的现有非现实方法，为对抗性鲁棒性研究建立了新基准，弥合了理论攻击强度与实际隐蔽性之间的差距。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Motivation: 传统的时间显著性检测后处理方法计算成本高，而现有声称可解释的模型往往在标准基准测试中表现不佳。需要一种既能有效捕捉时间显著性又能保持高性能的平衡方法。

Method: 提出CrossScaleNet架构，结合基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，在训练过程中嵌入注意力机制来提供内在的时间可解释性。

Result: 在合成数据集和公共基准测试中验证了方法的鲁棒性。在真实世界预测任务中，该模型持续优于大多数基于Transformer的模型，在不牺牲预测准确性的情况下提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet填补了现有模型的空白，提供了一种平衡的方法，能有效捕捉时间显著性，同时在各种复杂度的数据集上提供最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，精确分割PET/CT图像中的IGTV对移动肿瘤的放射治疗至关重要，但面临标注数据有限和肿瘤边界PET信号强度衰减的挑战。

Method: 使用在大量GTV数据集上预训练的多模态交互感知网络，在私有IGTV数据集上进行微调；引入切片交互模块(SIM)在2.5D分割框架中建模切片间关系，集成通道和空间注意力分支与深度卷积。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和SIM模块在提高IGTV分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力，对肺癌放射治疗规划具有重要意义。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR，首次将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）集成到基于隐式神经表示的可变形图像配准中，通过随机基函数采样策略降低计算成本，在多个医学影像数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的医学图像配准方法需要大量训练数据且精度有限，而隐式神经表示方法虽然精度高但需要实例特定优化，计算效率和稳定性是关键挑战。

Method: 将KANs集成到隐式神经表示配准框架中，提出随机基函数采样策略减少所需基函数数量，同时保持配准质量。

Result: 在肺部CT、脑部MRI和心脏MRI三个数据集上，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在所有评估模态和解剖结构中实现了INR方法中最高的精度，计算开销最小且学习稳定性最佳。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR在消除额外训练时间复杂度的同时，性能略优于可学习基函数索引的模型，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

Conclusion: CST是一种有效的图像集合处理架构，支持预训练和迁移学习，发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST在红外小目标检测任务中实现了最先进的性能，具有良好的泛化能力和实时推理能力，为国防和监控应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

TL;DR: 提出基于连续子流形场的3D高斯泼溅嵌入表示方法，解决原始高斯参数在神经网络中学习困难的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的原始参数表示存在非唯一性和异构性问题，直接用于神经网络学习会产生高度数据依赖的模型，需要一种能保持颜色和几何结构、确保唯一映射和通道同质性的表示方法

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建3D高斯泼溅的嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的本质信息

Result: 该方法能够更好地支持3D高斯泼溅的学习

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法为3D高斯泼溅在神经网络中的学习提供了更原则性的解决方案

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出soft embeddings方法，将一步生成器的离散token输出转换为可微分的连续表示，解决了现有一步生成器无法进行对抗训练、奖励微调等后蒸馏优化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从掩码扩散模型蒸馏的一步生成器存在两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散token输出阻断梯度流动，无法进行后蒸馏优化。

Method: 引入soft embeddings，用生成器输出分布的期望嵌入替换离散token，保持表示保真度的同时提供完全可微分的连续替代表示，与教师骨干网络和tokenizer解码器兼容。

Result: 在多个MDM教师模型上，Soft-Di[M]O实现最先进的一步生成效果：改进的类别到图像性能，在ImageNet-256上通过GAN优化达到1.56的FID，文本到图像任务获得更高的GenEval和HPS分数，并通过TTEO获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: soft embeddings使一步生成器端到端可训练，支持GAN优化、可微分奖励微调和TTEO，显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

TL;DR: FishAI 2.0是一个智能海洋鱼类识别框架，通过多模态少样本深度学习和图像生成技术解决稀有物种数据稀缺问题，在家族、属和物种级别都取得了优异的识别准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 传统海洋生物图像识别面临数据集不完整和模型精度不足的问题，特别是在稀有物种的少样本条件下，数据稀缺严重影响了性能表现。

Method: 使用分层海洋鱼类基准数据集，利用大语言模型DeepSeek生成高质量文本描述，通过Stable Diffusion 2进行图像增强，采用分层扩散策略构建多模态特征空间，最后基于CLIP模型进行少样本图像识别。

Result: FishAI 2.0在家族级别达到Top-1准确率91.67%和Top-5准确率97.97%，在属和物种级别分别达到87.58%和85.42%，显著优于基线CLIP和ViT模型。

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ICH的AI解决方案开发受限于碎片化的公开数据，需要建立一个统一、细粒度的基准数据集来支持多任务学习和AI辅助诊断系统的设计。

Method: 收集2012-2024年间的372个头部CT检查，采用双读工作流程进行详尽标注，包括五类ICH亚型的分类标签、边界框、像素掩码和体素掩码，并通过神经外科医生裁决保持低评分者间变异性。

Result: 使用标准卷积和transformer架构进行微调，轻量级模型MobileViT-XS在二元分类中达到87.8%的F1分数，U-Net与DenseNet161编码器在病变分割中达到85.5%的Dice分数。

Conclusion: Hemorica数据集提供了高质量标注和足够样本量，支持多任务学习、课程学习，并促进AI辅助ICH检测和量化系统的设计。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

Result: 在公共数据集上的广泛定性和定量实验表明，该方法在性能上可与基于扩散模型的最先进视图合成方法相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: ARSS框架证明了自回归模型在视图合成任务中的有效性，能够生成一致的多视角视图，代码将在论文接受后发布。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非动态人体运动，这种静态偏置导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中表现不佳

Method: 使用偏置流和无偏置流之间的统计独立性损失，结合场景预测损失

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏置，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性

Conclusion: 通过分离动态和静态信息并引入适当的损失函数，可以有效缓解动作识别模型的静态偏置问题

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Desensitized Adversarial Training (DesenAT)的方法，通过特征脱敏和自蒸馏框架来减轻DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，从而提高模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于场景复杂性、传感器不准确性和处理不精确性，点云损坏是不可避免的。DNN对输入特征的过度依赖是其脆弱性的根本原因，但尚不清楚这个问题是否存在于涉及点云的3D任务中，以及减少对这些特征的依赖是否能增强模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DesenAT方法：1）使用Shapley值量化DNN对点云特征的敏感性；2）通过消除高贡献成分的数据点和使用空间变换模拟损坏场景来生成对抗样本；3）在自蒸馏框架中进行对抗训练，将干净样本的知识转移到对抗样本中。

Result: 在ModelNet-C和PointCloud-C上的大量实验表明，该方法能有效提高模型的鲁棒性，同时不会降低在干净数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: DesenAT方法通过平滑特征敏感性，成功减轻了DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，显著提高了模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性，为3D点云处理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用统一多模态模型进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Result: DPM能够可靠地检测侵权内容，并构建了CIDD数据集用于标准化基准测试。

Conclusion: DPM为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供了可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级多模态预训练变换器Presto的传感器灵活洪水检测方法，能够使用SAR、多光谱或两者组合数据进行洪水制图，在Sen1Floods11数据集上表现优于大型基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前洪水监测中的操作挑战：单传感器方法受天气依赖和数据可用性限制，多传感器融合方法需要大量计算资源和标注数据。

Method: 通过微调轻量级多模态预训练变换器Presto（约0.4M参数），处理SAR和多光谱数据的像素级洪水检测，支持单一或组合传感器输入。

Result: 在传感器融合场景下F1得分0.896、mIoU 0.886，优于Prithvi-100M基准；在多光谱场景下F1 0.893，SAR场景下F1 0.718，表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种参数高效、传感器灵活的方法为需要即时洪水范围评估的实际灾害场景提供了可访问且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

### [42] [GeLoc3r: Enhancing Relative Camera Pose Regression with Geometric Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23038)
*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化(GCR)增强位姿回归方法，在训练时利用深度信息生成3D-2D对应关系并计算几何一致位姿，创建一致性损失来提升回归网络性能，在保持快速推理的同时接近基于对应关系方法的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R内部表示的几何不一致性问题，克服回归方法速度与基于对应关系方法精度之间的权衡困境。

Method: 使用几何一致性正则化(GCR)：训练时利用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致位姿，创建一致性损失来训练回归网络。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升到40.45%(相对提升16%)，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升到68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升到50.45%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过在训练时教授几何一致性而非推理时强制执行，实现了回归方法的速度与对应关系方法几何理解能力的结合，代表了神经网络学习相机几何的新范式。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供既忠实又最小化的解释，既能保留模型行为又能去除不相关区域，提高可解释性。

Method: 训练轻量自编码器生成二值掩码，结合多层激活匹配（KL散度和交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积、二值化惩罚、总变差）和溯因约束，确保解释的忠实性和必要性。

Result: 生成小而清晰的二值掩码，保留分类器行为同时去除不相关区域，提供实用且忠实的最小化解释。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成忠实且最小化的解释，提升模型决策的可解释性，适用于各种预训练分类器。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

TL;DR: 提出Mask What Matters框架，通过文本引导的可控掩码策略改进自监督医学图像分析，在多种医学影像模态上显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 医学影像领域标注数据稀缺，现有自监督掩码图像建模方法依赖随机高比例掩码，导致效率低下和语义对齐不佳。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，对诊断相关区域应用差异化掩码，减少背景区域冗余。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部CT和肺部X光等多种医学影像模态上，分类准确率提升达3.1个百分点，检测性能提升1.3 BoxAP和1.1 MaskAP，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Motivation: 航拍图像中小目标检测面临视觉线索有限和全局上下文建模困难的挑战，现有方法存在上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足的问题。

Method: 使用WeKat骨干网络通过小波变换增强全局低频上下文感知，采用Kolmogorov-Arnold网络进行自适应非线性建模；引入轻量级CPF模块减少冗余；使用MDFC模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在基准航拍数据集上达到最先进性能，参数更少。在VisDrone数据集上比基线提升6.5% AP和8.2% AP50。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航拍小目标检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局信息，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

TL;DR: 本文研究图像修复中的偏好对齐问题，通过直接偏好优化方法和公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集，发现奖励模型存在可观察的偏见，通过简单集成方法能有效缓解这些偏见，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图像修复中实现偏好对齐的基本问题，而不是引入新方法，旨在建立一个简单而坚实的基准线。

Method: 利用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，使用公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集，在九个奖励模型、两个基准测试和两个不同结构的基线模型上进行实验。

Result: 发现大多数奖励模型能提供有效的奖励分数来构建偏好数据；偏好数据在候选扩展和样本扩展方面表现出稳健趋势；奖励模型存在亮度、构图和色彩方案等可观察偏见；通过简单集成这些模型能获得稳健和可泛化的结果。

Conclusion: 基于这些观察，对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人工评估中显著优于先前模型，无需改变模型结构或使用新数据集，为这一有前景的领域设定了简单而坚实的基准。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理高倍数图像计算成本高，难以在临床环境中部署。需要开发轻量级模型以在资源受限的临床环境中实现实时病理AI集成。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包含双级知识转移（全局图像表示对齐和局部空间标记映射），使用紧凑主干网络完全在5x放大倍数下运行，比现有方法减少11.3倍图像块需求。

Result: 在6个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，XMAG的诊断准确率与大型基础模型相差不到1%，同时实现30倍处理加速，达到每分钟处理8.8张全切片图像的速度。跨机构验证显示良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型能力的可行方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过增强视觉语言模型中的空间表示来改进空间定位能力，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。语言流中现有方法主要关注主要名词短语，忽略了上下文标记；视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像模态的空间表示：对于语言，构建包含空间线索的混合文本特征；对于视觉，从中间层提取补丁级图像特征，其中空间结构得到更好保留。这些增强特征融合到聚类图像-文本相似度图CoMap中，实现精确掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上显著改进了零样本参考图像分割的空间定位能力（提升2-7 mIoU），无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有的未开发空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于条件依赖耦合策略的统一多阶段生成框架，通过多阶段插值轨迹分解生成过程，在保证准确分布学习的同时实现端到端优化，整个过程建模为单一扩散Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在计算与保真度之间存在权衡：基于VAE的模型存在信息损失、细节有限且不支持端到端训练；像素空间模型计算成本过高；级联模型虽降低计算成本但阶段分离阻碍端到端优化和知识共享。

Method: 采用条件依赖耦合策略，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，整个框架建模为单一扩散Transformer，避免模块分离并支持知识共享。

Result: 在多个分辨率下实现了高保真度和高效率，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了现有模型在计算效率与生成质量之间的权衡问题，实现了端到端优化和准确分布学习。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Conclusion: 展示了自监督模型在卒中诊断中的优势，同时分析了当前方法的限制，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂地球观测任务时能力有限，现有代理方法局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建基于MCP工具生态系统的代理框架，支持动态调用跨模态的专家工具和模型，实现RGB和光谱数据的统一处理。

Result: 开发了Earth-Bench基准测试，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像，涵盖光谱、产品和RGB模态，并采用双级评估协议评估推理轨迹和最终结果。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为地球观测分析建立了新范式，推动了LLMs在地球观测中科学基础化、下一代应用的发展。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像修复方法通常依赖任务特定的物理先验，其狭窄的焦点限制了在多样化真实天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容；提出亮度退化引导模块(LDGM)通过频域幅度调制注入退化先验；引入难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块增强语义一致性。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中达到了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一的非配对框架成功解决了多天气条件下的图像修复问题，无需依赖复杂的天气物理建模，展现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 提出多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，并利用这些稀疏关键点估计密集运动以实现时间一致和真实纹理的视频合成，同时集成顶点预测器学习人体顶点几何。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人体动画和沉浸式娱乐。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Conclusion: 这项工作为可扩展的AI驱动车轴计数系统迈出重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的领域泛化能力和校准性能，同时保持编码器冻结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在应用于医学体积数据时存在领域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(1)通过特征Fisher信息惩罚(FIP)减少编码器对领域偏移的敏感性；(2)通过置信度错位惩罚(CMP)惩罚过度自信的体素级错误；仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提升准确性和校准：在BraTS扫描仪分割上，DSC相对提升+7.4%，HD95减少-26.9%，ECE减少-39.5%；在ATLAS-C上，DSC相对提升+5.3%，ECE减少-32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM为脑MRI分割提供了改进的领域泛化能力和更好的校准不确定性估计，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

Motivation: 现有的无监督在线3D实例分割方法（如UNIT）在训练多样性、时间采样灵活性和对噪声伪标签的依赖方面存在限制，需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 通过合成点云序列生成丰富训练分布，采用灵活的时间采样策略结合相邻和非相邻帧，并使用动态加权损失强调置信度高的样本。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过增强训练多样性、改进时间建模和优化损失函数，显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Motivation: 人脸识别系统面临对抗攻击的安全威胁，但现有攻击大多局限于数字域或需要白盒访问。需要开发在黑盒设置下仍能有效攻击的物理可转移对抗补丁。

Method: 使用查询高效的零阶贪婪算法，通过逐步添加高斯斑点来迭代构建对称灰度模式。仅利用替代FR模型的余弦相似度分数来指导优化，最大化降低身份识别准确率。

Result: 在约10,000次查询黑盒ArcFace模型后，GaP在数字和真实世界物理测试中都实现了高攻击成功率。攻击表现出强转移性，成功欺骗了完全未见过的FaceNet模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一个实际且严重的漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建出鲁棒且可转移的攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，相比标准密集模型反演(DMI)和稀疏模型反演(SMI)更高效且性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏模型反演(SMI)方法在ViT模型上过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但实际上这些patch通过持续反演也能获得可迁移知识，导致效率低下和特征提取不充分。

Method: PRI方法在反演过程中逐步分离最重要的patch来构建稀疏图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化以供后续选择，实现渐进式稀疏化。

Result: PRI比标准DMI快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上持续优于SMI，与DMI性能相当。

Conclusion: PRI通过渐进式patch分离策略有效平衡了类无关和类特定知识，实现了高效且高性能的模型反演。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督，提供可扩展且高效的解决方案，能有效利用无标签数据减少幻觉

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and

compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像在ADAS中具有优势，但面临数据集有限和模拟器代表性不足的问题，现有RGB到热成像转换方法局限于一对一映射。

Method: 使用多模态翻译框架，提出组件感知自适应实例归一化(CoAdaIN)，相比原始AdaIN的全局风格应用，CoAdaIN能针对不同图像组件单独调整风格。

Result: 生成了更真实和多样化的热成像图像转换结果。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法有效提升了RGB到热成像图像转换的质量和多样性，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据生成方案。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper
published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is

Motivation: LiDAR点云提供隐私保护且对光照鲁棒的活动识别方案，需要开发直接从点云几何中提取紧凑可解释特征的方法，作为端到端深度学习的替代方案。

Method: 将LiDAR帧映射为邻近图(epsilon-graph)，计算拉普拉斯谱，使用特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，通过滑动窗口的时间统计生成固定向量，用支持向量机和随机森林进行分类。

Result: 在MM-Fi数据集(40个受试者，27种活动)上，采用严格受试者独立协议，在13类康复活动上达到94.4%准确率，所有27种活动达到90.3%准确率，超越了基于骨架的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种直接从点云几何中提取的紧凑可解释特征集，为人体活动识别提供了准确高效的端到端深度学习替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

TL;DR: OracleGS是一个新颖的稀疏视图高斯溅射框架，通过"提议-验证"机制结合生成模型的完整性和回归模型的几何保真度，利用3D感知扩散模型生成完整场景，再用多视角立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图新视角合成存在严重的几何模糊性，现有方法在生成完整性和几何保真度之间存在权衡：回归模型几何忠实但不完整，生成模型能补全场景但常引入结构不一致性。

Method: 首先使用预训练的3D感知扩散模型合成新视图来提议完整场景，然后重新利用多视角立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的3D不确定性，通过注意力图揭示多视角证据支持的区域和高不确定性区域，使用不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射模型的优化。

Result: 该方法在Mip-NeRF 360和NeRF Synthetic等数据集上优于最先进方法，能够过滤幻觉伪影，同时在约束不足的区域保留合理的补全。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验条件化于多视角几何证据，实现了生成完整性和回归保真度的协调统一。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，通过添加对抗扰动明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制，完全破坏运动合成同时保持输入图像的语义保真度。

Result: 实验证明该方法提供了出色的保护效果，免疫后的图像生成静止或接近静止的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防止I2V生成模型滥用的有前景方向，为鲁棒和主动防御提供了重要思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下因噪声严重和信息稀疏而表现不佳，需要利用生成先验来补充纹理信息。

Method: 首先使用ETFI从低光照脉冲流中聚合稀疏信息，然后作为ControlNet的输入条件生成高速场景图像，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升质量。

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上的表现证明了Diff-SPK的优越性，建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集。

Conclusion: Diff-SPK成功解决了低光照高速场景下脉冲相机重建的挑战，为脉冲视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型表面上具备文化能力，但实际上依赖肤浅的模式匹配而非真正的文化理解，需要开发评估框架来揭示这种局限性。

Method: 通过分类和解释分析，测试多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景等火主题文化图像上的推理能力。

Result: 模型存在系统性偏见：能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现不佳，经常提供模糊标签或将紧急情况危险地误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和泛化性的优势，为开放世界目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息基础，导致推理路径偏离图像内容并产生错误结论。

Method: 采用无需训练的解耦方法：强大的LLM负责高层推理，策略性地询问LMM以获取所需视觉信息；LMM专门作为视觉问答引擎按需提供感知细节。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，能有效解决LMMs在长推理链中视觉信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

*Kaile Du,Zihan Ye,Junzhou Xie,Fan Lyu,Yixi Shen,Yuyang Li,Miaoxuan Zhu,Fuyuan Hu,Ling Shao,Guangcan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类别特定的正负提示词解耦语义，并引入渐进置信度解耦策略来抑制假阳性，解决了多标签类增量学习中的语义混淆和部分标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于提示的方法在单标签类增量学习中表现良好，但直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)效果不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆和部分标注引起的真负假正混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含两个核心组件：1) 类别特定的正负提示词来解耦语义；2) 渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略，这是一种受课程学习启发的解耦方法，用于抑制假阳性。过去提示词被冻结作为知识锚点，层间提示提高了效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，DDP始终优于先前方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准下超过80% mAP和70% F1的无回放MLCIL方法。

Conclusion: DDP框架有效解决了多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过语义解耦和渐进置信度解耦策略实现了显著的性能提升，为无回放MLCIL方法设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LRPO框架，首次将在线强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复任务，通过似然正则化策略优化解决传统方法中的细节缺失和身份模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人脸恢复面临解空间大的挑战，传统方法容易产生细节缺失和身份模糊等伪影，需要一种能平衡感知质量和保真度的新方法。

Method: 使用LRPO框架，包含三个关键策略：1) 针对人脸恢复评估的复合奖励函数，2) 真值引导的似然正则化，3) 噪声级别优势分配。

Result: 大量实验表明，LRPO在基线方法基础上显著提升了人脸恢复质量，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: LRPO框架成功将强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复，通过精心设计的奖励机制和正则化策略，有效平衡了感知质量和保真度，实现了优异的恢复效果。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在口腔医学中主要专注于单一任务，难以满足临床实践中复杂的多模态需求，需要开发能够综合解读多种成像模式的智能诊断系统。

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的双语大规模数据集，开发能够解读7种2D口腔成像模式的多模态视觉语言模型。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，在错颌畸形诊断上高27.9%。临床研究中，在36个任务中的21个任务上优于13名初级牙医，在12个任务上优于12名高级牙医。协作工作流中可将初级牙医水平提升至高级水平，诊断时间减少15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，能够提升基层牙科护理质量，缓解医患资源不平衡，并在家庭口腔健康管理、医院智能诊断和多智能体协作等场景中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: Dynamic-TreeRPO提出了一种树结构采样策略，结合动态噪声强度和LayerTuning-RL训练范式，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在文本到图像生成中的方法存在探索效率低、采样策略无效的问题，需要一种能有效平衡探索多样性和计算效率的解决方案。

Method: 采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树结构搜索，结合动态噪声强度和GRPO引导优化，通过共享前缀路径降低计算开销，并整合SFT和RL范式形成LayerTuning-RL训练方法。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中分别超越现有最佳方法4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升近50%。

Conclusion: 树结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式能够有效提升文本到图像生成的质量、多样性和训练效率，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面表现优异。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

### [83] [Test-time Uncertainty Estimation for Medical Image Registration via Transformation Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23355)
*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种与任何预训练配准网络兼容的测试时不确定性估计框架，无需重新训练或架构修改，通过变换等变性原理分析网络预测的方差来估计配准不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构修改或重新训练，限制了其在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性特性，通过空间扰动输入图像并分析网络预测的方差，理论分解为内在扩散（反映认知噪声）和偏置抖动（捕捉系统性误差漂移）两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上的实验表明，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，并能突出需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转变为风险感知工具，使医学图像配准更接近在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的增强方法，通过将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，使用GRPO来弥合分布差异，包括长度、多语言和多模态偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在大规模检索系统中表现优异，但在输入分布与训练语料不同的任务中表现不佳。现有方法使用LLM进行查询重写，但由于缺乏监督信号，无法生成最优的重写结果。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，利用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，使用语料相对排序奖励来抑制虚假分数膨胀，优化与排序指标对齐。

Result: 在多语言差异（Flickr30k-CN、CVLUE、XM3600）、长度差异（Wikipedia）和多模态差异（CIRR）等分布偏移下，GRAPE在Recall@10上平均提升了4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE能有效提升在分布偏移下的检索性能，通过排序感知的策略优化解决了LLM查询重写中的分数膨胀问题。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个使用级联网络和知识蒸馏的点云补全框架，通过两阶段协同工作：形状重建生成辅助信息，融合补全利用这些信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界采集的点云通常由于传感器分辨率限制、单一视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，需要点云补全技术来预测整体形状并重建缺失区域。

Method: 采用级联网络结构，分为形状重建阶段和融合补全阶段，通过知识蒸馏将教师模型在更密集点云上训练的完整-不完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集的不同难度设置下，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入与完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

TL;DR: UniPose是一种统一的跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D姿态标注从RGB数据集迁移到3D领域，无需3D关键点标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量人工标注3D关键点的问题，利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D姿态标注进行弱监督学习。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动），通过2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互增强学习过程。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上，UniPose达到与全监督方法相当的性能，结合大规模无标签数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）在挑战性条件下性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: UniPose在无需3D标注的情况下实现了有效的3D人体姿态估计，其提出的3D提升方法达到了最先进水平，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 体型条件化的自接触先验能够有效提升自接触姿态的建模和估计精度。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了驾驶场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正负惊喜基准上高度相关；惊喜加权帧采样在五个下游基准上相比均匀采样获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLM跟踪信念并注册惊喜，为构建更鲁棒的模型铺平道路，使模型能够根据新信息修正理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

*Mohammed Alsakabi,Wael Mobeirek,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-SIREN和FM-FINER，通过为周期性激活函数分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，减少隐式神经表示中的特征冗余，提升信号重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子，导致层内神经元捕获重叠的频率分量，限制了多层感知机的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法启发，为周期性激活函数分配神经元特定的频率乘子，引入频率多样性而不需要超参数调优或增加网络深度。

Result: 将特征冗余减少近50%，在1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成等任务中持续提升信号重建性能，优于基线方法同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 这种简单而原则性的修改有效减少了特征冗余，提升了隐式神经表示在各种任务中的表达能力。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE是一个基于LLM的扩散编辑框架，通过引入参考坐标系来改进文本到图像生成中的空间理解，特别针对非相机视角的空间描述进行图像调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时存在显著性能差距，需要将长期被忽视的参考坐标系概念整合到多模态模型中。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，使用视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测语言与视觉的对齐情况，并应用新颖的潜在空间操作来调整生成图像的朝向和深度。

Result: 在专门评估参考坐标系空间理解的两个基准测试中，FoR-SALE仅通过单轮校正就将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了高达5.3%。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE成功地将参考坐标系整合到文本到图像生成中，显著改善了模型对空间描述的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心的规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，便于运动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，创建视角依赖的运动信号，这使健康监测和运动科学等应用中的比较分析变得复杂。

Method: 提出3DPCNet模块，使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测连续的6D旋转，映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。模型在MM-Fi数据集上通过合成旋转姿态进行自监督训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，该方法产生的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet能够有效消除视角变异性，实现物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动监测提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示时经常遗漏或误表示特定对象和属性，需要改进组合忠实度

Method: 将输入提示分解为语义概念，在全局和概念级别评估对齐，使用细粒度CLIP计算概念对应关系，通过迭代提示优化循环改进生成

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了概念覆盖率和人类评估的忠实度

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，优于标准测试时优化和基础模型

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸反欺诈方法在检测未见过的目标域攻击时表现不佳，而域自适应方法在多模态场景中尚未被探索。

Method: 1) 从其他模态提取互补特征来替代缺失模态；2) 利用多模态预测不确定性生成可靠伪标签；3) 设计自适应机制动态调整损失权重以防止模型退化。

Result: 大量实验证明MFAS-DANet的有效性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈在域自适应场景下的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RestoRect方法，通过潜在校正流特征蒸馏解决图像修复中性能与速度的权衡问题，结合Retinex理论、可学习各向异性扩散和三角色彩空间极化，实现快速高质量的图像修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像修复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型速度太慢，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构的动态特征生成过程。

Method: 应用校正流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，学生通过潜在空间中的可学习轨迹学习合成教师质量特征。结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像修复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示优越结果，实现更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持修复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect方法成功解决了图像修复中性能与速度的权衡问题，通过新颖的潜在校正流特征蒸馏框架实现了高效高质量的图像修复。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模无约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场，然后提出方向感知超高斯表示，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入统一概率状态，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验表明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实动态场景中优于主流方法，具有卓越的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的表示方法，有效解决了复杂动态场景的4D重建问题。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 该研究通过大规模实证分析发现，多模态基准测试中存在显著的模态依赖不平衡问题，许多旨在减少文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖，且模型规模增大可能掩盖多模态推理能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单模态依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和跨模态依赖（模态间关系）的相互作用对推进多模态学习至关重要，但目前基准评估中这些依赖的性质和交互关系尚未得到充分表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型对23个视觉问答基准进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域。

Result: 研究发现视觉、文本及其交互的依赖程度在不同基准间和基准内差异显著；许多旨在缓解文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖；这种特征在不同模型规模下持续存在，大模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能而掩盖多模态推理能力的缺乏。

Conclusion: 研究为多模态数据集提供了量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了一个鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，在临床和自动化诊断系统中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

Conclusion: 虽然低分辨率训练的视频模型作为强通用基线，但我们的自适应框架代表了安全关键应用中可靠性至关重要的最先进解决方案。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for

achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced

open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)作为神经辐射场(NeRF)的高效替代方案，在SLAM、远程呈现、机器人操作和3D内容生成等领域展现出优势，平衡了真实感渲染、几何保真度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3DGS如何在不同领域替代NeRF方法，探索其技术优势、适应性以及现有局限性，为神经渲染在感知、交互和内容创作中的应用提供路线图。

Method: 通过系统比较领域特定流程，围绕统一研究问题组织综述，分析3DGS的技术优势、多模态输入适应能力和领域约束处理能力。

Result: 3DGS在真实感渲染、几何保真度和计算效率方面达到良好平衡，正逐渐取代基于NeRF的方法，支持高质量渲染、快速优化和任务驱动的场景理解。

Conclusion: 3DGS为神经渲染在图像合成、感知、交互和内容创作中的应用提供了有效路径，能够跨越真实和虚拟环境实现统一解决方案。

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺部位（头、体、尾）分割的联邦学习方法，解决了胰腺疾病区域异质性和数据稀缺问题，在保护隐私的前提下实现了多机构协作训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（头部分癌症高发，尾部慢性胰腺炎导致组织损失），需要精确分割胰腺部位以支持精准诊断和治疗规划，但MRI中胰腺分割因形态多变、软组织对比度差而极具挑战性。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构协作训练，使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描；系统评估三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合；引入基于解剖学知识的损失函数，优先考虑MRI中区域特异性纹理对比度。

Result: 发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合最适合处理胰腺异质性；该方法在分布式异构数据集上训练仍能达到临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为胰腺部位分割提供了首个联邦学习解决方案，成功解决了数据稀缺和隐私保护问题，为精准胰腺疾病诊断和治疗规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通过将大脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来引导生成过程，这掩盖了不同大脑区域对最终重建输出的贡献影响。

Method: NeuroAdapter框架直接基于大脑表征条件化潜在扩散模型，并开发了图像-大脑双向可解释性框架(IBBI)，通过分析扩散去噪步骤中的交叉注意力机制来揭示不同皮层区域如何影响生成轨迹。

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时提供了大脑信号如何塑造生成过程的更大透明度。

Conclusion: 端到端大脑到图像解码具有潜力，并为通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型建立了路径。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

Conclusion: RobuQ成功解决了DiTs在极低比特量化中的核心挑战，为DiTs的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案，证明了系统化QAT框架在复杂Transformer架构量化中的有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的单步扩散框架和训练策略，有效解决了视频人脸增强的关键挑战，实现了高质量、高效率的人脸增强效果。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模拟图像的方法包含大量无关信息（如背景、噪声），严重影响迁移信息质量。本文探索使用具有强物理意义和可解释性的前向散射中心模型来迁移更纯净的关键目标知识。

Method: 提出多层次异构知识迁移网络：1）任务关联信息选择器分离非信息知识；2）目标通用知识迁移模块使用最大判别散度度量函数；3）类别关系知识迁移模块利用类别关系一致性约束。

Result: 在两个由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的新数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移，确保了迁移FSCM知识的完整性，有效解决了模拟与实测数据不平衡导致的优化偏差问题。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: 传统Mamba架构依赖预定义扫描路径，无法适应不同的图像退化情况，限制了修复性能和计算效率。需要开发能够自适应不同退化类型的方法。

Method: 提出了两个关键创新：1) QCLAM使用FIFO缓存存储历史表示，通过LoRA适配特征与缓存特征的相似性指导智能融合；2) GPS-SS2D使用Vision Transformer生成得分图估计像素重要性，通过贪心策略确定最优扫描路径。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than

PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced

Conclusion: VMDiff能有效解决图像融合中的共存和偏差问题，生成具有更好视觉质量和语义一致性的融合图像。

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功解决了图像增强中效率与表示能力的权衡问题，实现了实时处理与高质量增强的结合。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理3D场景中与可移动物体的文本控制交互生成，解决了物体识别、多样化交互和碰撞避免等挑战。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

TL;DR: DiffInk是一个用于全行手写生成的潜在扩散Transformer框架，通过InkVAE和InkDiT组件实现高效的文本到手写轨迹生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注字符或单词级别的手写生成，在全行文本生成时效率低下且缺乏整体结构建模。

Method: 提出InkVAE（带有OCR损失和风格分类损失的变分自编码器）和InkDiT（潜在扩散Transformer），在潜在空间中分离字符内容和书写风格。

Result: DiffInk在字形准确性和风格保真度上优于现有最先进方法，同时显著提高了生成效率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了全行手写生成的效率和结构建模问题，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过内省训练和递归推理机制赋予掩码扩散视觉语言模型自我纠错能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自我纠错能力，无法修正生成token中的错误，这限制了模型的可靠性和准确性。

Method: 1. 内省训练：引入内省模型来识别生成序列中的错误，包括语法、拼写和逻辑错误；2. 递归推理：采用解掩码→内省→重掩码的交替过程，递归执行直到获得可靠结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RIV模型实现了最先进的性能，优于大多数现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: RIV模型通过内省训练和递归推理机制成功解决了掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自我纠错能力的问题，显著提升了模型的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测在机器人应用中很重要，但面临域偏移问题。现有的多任务UDA方法主要依赖对抗学习，效果不如自训练技术。

Method: 集成分割和深度基础模型到自训练范式中，生成目标域的高质量伪标签，将鲁棒泛化能力蒸馏到单个高效学生网络中。

Result: 在标准合成到真实UDA多任务学习基准和新的日间到夜间自适应任务上达到最先进性能，轻量级变体比基础模型小10倍以上。

Conclusion: FAMDA适合为资源受限的机器人应用创建域自适应和高效模型。

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

TL;DR: MotionVerse是一个统一的框架，利用大语言模型理解和生成单人与多人人体运动，通过运动分词器和延迟并行建模策略实现高效运动表示和生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理人体运动时面临模态干扰、计算效率低等问题，需要统一的框架来同时处理运动理解和生成任务。

Method: 使用带残差量化的运动分词器将连续运动序列转换为多流离散标记；提出延迟并行建模策略，在时间上错开残差标记流的编码；设计双塔架构，使用模态特定参数减轻运动与语言间的模态干扰。

Result: 综合消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明MotionVerse在多种运动相关任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过创新的运动表示和建模策略，成功实现了高效的人体运动理解和生成，在单人和多人场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本编码器的嵌入来提升文本到图像扩散模型的公平性，采用协作距离约束去偏策略和两阶段文本引导采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要对扩散模型进行全参数训练或依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练负担重且性能不理想。本文发现文本编码器作为最可微调的前端模块，其输出在CLIP空间中存在显著偏差，且噪声预测网络会进一步放大这种不平衡。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略来平衡嵌入距离以改善公平性，无需辅助参考；同时引入两阶段文本引导采样策略，限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机以避免影响原始生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，该方法仅需1/4的训练负担即可达到最先进的去偏效果，采样负担几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的公平性提升方法，通过针对性微调文本编码器嵌入，在保证生成质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL通过线性复杂度设计显著提升了计算效率，同时在性能上超越了现有的多实例学习方法，证明了高效序列模型在计算病理学中的有效性。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇综述系统回顾了自动驾驶中拓扑感知感知的四个核心研究方向：矢量化地图构建、拓扑结构建模、先验知识融合和基于语言模型的感知，揭示了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性。需要转向动态感知方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图构建）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构建模）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验知识融合）和基于预训练语言模型的多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些方法共同推动了更适应性强、可扩展且可解释的自动驾驶系统的发展，实现了从静态地图到动态实时感知的转变。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知感知的四个研究方向共同促成了从静态预建地图到动态传感器驱动感知的范式转变，为自动驾驶系统提供了更强的适应性、可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制存在局限性，需要更精确的内容和位置指导来实现精细控制

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考只需单张图像，提供对象和部件级别的显式简单控制

Result: 在各种图像合成任务中展示了其有效性

Conclusion: 该方法实现了多图像布局控制，能够精确指定内容及其在图像中的位置

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，使用表面锚定和视域分区来突破分辨率限制，在保持几何一致性的同时保留纹理高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视图一致性导致纹理撕裂或漂移，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而丢失精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建；表面锚定采用可学习的上采样策略将体素约束到网格表面；视域分区引入图像块引导的体素分区方案，仅在可见局部块上进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 表面锚定消除了传统体素上采样中70%以上的冗余体素；显著减少了高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗；在保持几何一致性的同时保留了纹理中的高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up框架通过创新的表面锚定和视域分区策略，有效解决了3D纹理建模中的高频细节丢失问题，实现了内存效率和高保真度的平衡。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下新颖物体的鲁棒6D姿态估计问题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的光照不变颜色对特征表示，为初始估计阶段提供RGB-D视图与物体3D网格的鲁棒配准，为跟踪阶段验证时间对应关系，使轻量模型能够可靠回归物体运动。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使在突然姿态变化下也能保持。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架通过共享特征表示成功实现了准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪的协同，特别适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Conclusion: ReWatch数据集和ReWatch-R1模型有效解决了视频推理中的数据瓶颈问题，通过创新的多智能体ReAct框架和RLVR训练方法，显著提升了复杂视频推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉token数量庞大，严重阻碍推理效率，且许多token不重要可以安全剪枝。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层注意力图估计token重要性，采用分层剪枝策略：全局保留阶段按区域保留重要token，局部保留阶段在窗口内保留最重要token。

Result: LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的首次token时间分别降低50.0%和55.1%，token生成吞吐量分别提升60.9%和47.3%，准确性不损失甚至在某些基准上有所提升。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持更好准确性的同时提供更高的推理效率，优于先前工作。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出STIM-TM方法，通过时空分离的令牌合并策略显著降低手术视频理解的计算成本，在保持精度的同时减少65%以上的GFLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer模型在手术视频理解中计算成本过高，且现有令牌合并方法未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性。

Method: 采用时空分离策略：时间维度通过显著性权重合并连续帧的对应空间令牌；空间维度基于时间稳定性分析优先合并静态令牌，保护动态区域。

Result: 无需训练即可实现超过65%的GFLOPs减少，同时在各种手术视频任务中保持竞争力精度，支持长序列手术视频的高效训练。

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的令牌合并方法，有效解决了计算瓶颈问题，为手术应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了区域理解指数(RCI)，这是首个基于模型的评分方法，用于直接量化数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度，揭示了大多数多模态基准测试偏向局部推理并存在显著空间偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉语言基准测试中表现优异，但不清楚这些基准是否真正评估了全局推理能力，还是仅通过局部视觉线索就能成功。现有评估方法无法明确区分这一点，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向实际应用的模型开发。

Method: 引入区域理解指数(RCI)，通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解，还是可以通过部分或局部视觉线索解决。

Result: 将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准测试，发现大多数基准偏向局部推理并表现出显著的空间偏差，表明在实际应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了一个可操作的工具，用于诊断和缓解这些偏差，使得能够构建促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，通过双向空间感知和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，解决3D多模态图像分割中全局注意力机制计算复杂度高的问题，在保持高计算效率的同时提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度全局注意力机制捕获长距离依赖，导致非线性计算复杂度和高资源消耗。知识蒸馏和稀疏注意力机制虽能提高效率，但在复杂任务中难以达到高分割精度。平衡模型性能与计算效率是重要挑战。

Method: 集成双向空间感知分支捕获大脑区域的长距离空间上下文依赖，并包含强大的非线性特征提取机制。提出多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，增强分层特征表示并改善不同分辨率级别的语义信息传递。

Result: 在多个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，MSD-KMamba在分割精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面持续优于最先进方法，同时保持高计算效率和良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba框架通过双向空间感知和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，有效缓解体积分割中的二次计算复杂度瓶颈，同时解决全局感知不足的限制，实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

TL;DR: QuantSparse是一个统一框架，结合模型量化和注意力稀疏化来压缩扩散变换器，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用量化或注意力稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重性能下降，需要一种统一的压缩方法。

Method: 提出QuantSparse框架，包含多尺度显著注意力蒸馏（提供全局结构指导和局部显著监督）和二阶稀疏注意力重参数化（利用二阶残差的时间稳定性恢复稀疏化丢失的信息）。

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时实现3.68倍的存储减少和1.88倍的端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: QuantSparse成功解决了量化和稀疏化结合时的性能下降问题，为扩散变换器的实际部署提供了高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖五种常见家庭安全隐患，通过动态第一人称视角图像评估视觉语言模型在家庭安全检查中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键限制：使用文本描述而非视觉信息，以及使用静态单一视角，这阻碍了基于视觉语言模型的具身代理的准确评估，并可能导致某些安全隐患被遗漏。

Method: 构建包含12,900个数据点的基准测试，涵盖火灾、触电、坠落物、绊倒和儿童安全五种安全隐患，提供模拟家庭环境中的动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身代理自由探索房间。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过融合多种骨干网络的SSD模型，使用加权框融合方法显著提升了武器检测的鲁棒性，在具有遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景的挑战性条件下实现了更好的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全需要可靠的武器检测系统，但现有单模型检测器在遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3等不同骨干网络训练多个SSD模型，然后采用加权框融合(WBF)方法结合这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 使用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的平均精度(mAP)，比最佳单模型相对提升了2.948%，且优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 融合策略与模型多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制，为监控应用中的实时武器检测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁交互和实时要求带来的严格带宽限制问题，同时弥补LiDAR焦点实现中性能不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；双分支检测路由方案解耦协作相关和不相关实例；跨智能体局部实例融合模块聚合局部混合实例特征。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上分别实现13.23%和33.08%的精度提升，同时将通信带宽降低至现有最优方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT框架在显著降低通信带宽需求的同时，实现了优于现有方法的协作感知性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法虽然能处理物体效果（如阴影、反射），但在统一模型中应用分类器自由引导来处理物体效果的性能影响尚未充分探索，且复合编辑效率有待提升。

Method: 在单一模型中联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入，在分类器自由引导方案中利用这些嵌入，增强物体及其效果的移除，并在插入时实现物体效果的可控合成。

Result: 实验表明CrimEdit实现了优越的物体移除、可控效果插入和高效物体移动，无需额外训练或分离的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过统一的模型和引导技术，在物体编辑任务中实现了高效且高质量的性能，为复合编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

Motivation: 帕金森病诊断流程复杂且严重依赖神经科医生专业知识，导致早期检测延迟和及时干预机会错失，需要自动化诊断解决方案。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识和多级约束，实现了高效准确的帕金森病自动化诊断，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Conclusion: DiffPCN通过结合扩散模型的强大生成能力和专门设计的点云处理模块，成功实现了高质量的点云补全。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

*Shubhang Bhatnagar,Andy Xu,Kar-Han Tan,Narendra Ahuja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LUQ（层间超低位量化）方法，针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行超低位（<4位）量化，通过选择性对量化容忍度更高的层应用超低位量化，显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要巨大内存和计算资源，虽然后训练量化已成功将语言模型压缩至1位精度，但其在多模态LLMs中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LUQ方法：1）分析发现多模态令牌具有更高统计方差和熵，对超低位量化容忍度较低；2）识别量化容忍度更高的层；3）选择性应用超低位量化；4）使用混合多模态令牌进行PTQ提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上测试9个VQA基准，LUQ模型比4位模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准上性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法有效实现了多模态LLMs的超低位量化，在显著减少内存使用的同时保持可接受的性能损失。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一个基于ViT的多尺度视觉分词器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，实现从低分辨率全局语义特征到高分辨率结构细节的信息渐进流动。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样生成多尺度token序列，并结合尺度因果注意力机制来促进信息流动。

Result: 相比单尺度方法，rFID提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)，下游生成任务收敛速度提升1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%(16.4→13.3)，最佳rFID达0.45，gFID达1.82。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个多尺度ViT分词器，通过更平滑均匀的潜在空间显著提升了视觉生成任务的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点云图，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，导致重建效果受限。

Method: 采用序列化输入，使用基于transformer的门控更新模块维护空间记忆，将场景划分为子图进行局部对齐，并通过相对约束将所有子图注册到统一世界坐标系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架在保持实时性能的同时实现了优越的重建精度。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和全局一致性优化，显著提升了密集场景重建的质量和一致性。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征学习和特征尺度一致性约束，有效解决了类无关异常检测中的特征相关性问题，实现了优异的跨类别泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Conclusion: 自我精炼过程能有效提升视觉指向性能，强化学习训练的方法具有良好效果，相关代码和模型已开源

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Conclusion: GenView++通过改进正样本对构建和质量评估机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉语言任务上的性能，证明了高质量样本对构建和差异化处理的重要性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ模型在视觉先验建模中的关键问题，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性的影响，这限制了模型在现实场景中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)方法，使用组特定文本提示作为组代表，为每个目标类构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的组也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于完全微调整个网络的方法，而仅训练了网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调后视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，同时保持参数高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Motivation: 现有基于图像的方法生成多样化布局但缺乏几何连续性和可扩展性，基于图的方法捕获结构关系但忽略地块语义，需要结合几何和语义的城市建模方法。

Method: 融合几何和语义属性，引入边权重，在图结构中嵌入建筑高度，将2D布局扩展到逼真的3D结构，支持用户通过语义属性直接控制输出。

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven
planning and design.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理和文本理解方面表现出色，但在理解隐私概念方面存在严重局限性，需要测试这些模型理解和执行隐私原则的能力。

Method: 引入了一个全面的多级视觉隐私分类法，用于捕捉广泛的隐私问题，并评估了多个最先进的视觉语言模型的能力。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在理解上下文隐私方面存在显著不一致性，表明当前AI系统在隐私意识方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发更强大、更具隐私意识的AI系统，本文为未来研究提供了基础分类法和当前模型局限性的关键基准。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一4D场景理解和生成的视觉语言模型框架，通过共享表示和架构实现时空感知的4D视觉语言统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法在场景理解和生成任务上存在范式差距，无法在动态4D设置中统一处理这两个任务，特别是时空建模至关重要。

Method: 1) 提取语义特征用于理解和噪声注入的外观特征用于生成，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合成时空感知的视觉表示；2) 在Transformer骨干上构建自回归和扩散模型，集成到单一LLM中，配备任务特定头。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Uni4D-LLM相比最先进模型取得了竞争性或更优的结果，实现了4D场景理解和生成的真正统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过共享表示和架构设计，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一，为物理世界的视觉语言建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

TL;DR: 评估Segment Concept (SeC)框架在MOSEv2数据集上的零样本性能，无需微调即在复杂视频对象分割挑战中排名第二


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在视觉剧烈变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战下鲁棒性有限，缺乏对目标的高层次概念理解

Method: 使用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标的深度语义理解，实现更持久的视频对象分割

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上获得39.7 JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二

Conclusion: SeC框架通过语义理解提升了视频对象分割的鲁棒性，在零样本设置下表现出色

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Motivation: 现有文本到3D质量评估存在基准过时、碎片化、粒度粗，以及客观指标设计局限导致特征提取不具代表性和鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 构建包含5个组件12个子组件的组合提示基准，生成3600个纹理网格；提出Rank2Score两阶段训练评估器，第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性映射方法只能突出重要区域但需要用户自行解释含义，而基于概念的方法虽然能分解预测但很少能同时揭示学习的概念、相关区域及其贡献。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入。通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，并基于对分类分数的影响量化其贡献。

Result: 方法在定性和定量评估中优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现优异，无需标注数据集即可处理任意概念。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念，无需标注数据集。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个新颖的混合框架，结合CNN和ViT的优势来提升面部美观度预测的准确性和公平性，同时通过对抗性去偏机制减少算法偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部美观度预测方法存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度的问题。CNN擅长局部纹理但忽略全局和谐，ViT能建模长距离依赖但可能遗漏细节细节，且模型容易学习社会偏见。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架：CNN分支提取局部特征，ViT分支建模全局上下文，并引入对抗性去偏机制，使特征提取器产生对受保护属性不变的表示。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN实现了皮尔逊相关系数0.9230和RMSE 0.2650的新SOTA，公平性方面种族子群间的性能差距减少了82.9%，对抗分类准确率降至52.1%。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了稳健、透明且更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Sim-DETR方法，通过约束解码器层中的自注意力机制和添加查询-帧对齐，解决了DETR在时序语句定位任务中的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型的DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有提升性能，反而可能降低性能。通过系统分析识别出两个根本原因：相似目标时刻查询之间的冲突，以及全局语义与局部定位之间的内部查询冲突。

Method: 在标准DETR解码器层中进行两个小修改：(1) 基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；(2) 添加查询-帧对齐以桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: 实验表明Sim-DETR能够充分释放DETR在时序语句定位任务中的潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线。

Conclusion: Sim-DETR是一个简单而强大的基线方法，通过解决DETR在时序语句定位中的特定问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放导致跨时间步的补丁间信息不一致，这些不一致会分散引导信号，使其偏离条件信息，留下模糊不忠实的特征。

Method: 提出信息锚定引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力自适应地增强采样过程中的信息丰富补丁，确保引导与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG能够生成更清晰、更连贯且语义更准确锚定的图像，为基于自回归的方法设立了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG机制有效解决了自回归图像生成中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义准确性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉MLLM在真实场景中对无关视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较局部图像块和完整图像输入的性能变化来系统量化MLLM的鲁棒性。

Result: 评估19个先进MLLM发现大多数模型对背景噪声脆弱，仅InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现一致鲁棒。

Conclusion: PCRI能够严格比较上下文鲁棒性，为模型选择和未来架构开发提供指导，支持稳健的实际部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 所提方法显著改进了相关半监督3D目标检测方法，实现了自动化和自适应的伪标签选择

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖配对数据且泛化能力差，扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，自监督方法在不同剂量间泛化性能下降严重。

Method: 设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，使用像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度。

Conclusion: SuperDiff仅需LDCT投影域数据进行训练和测试，通过双域策略级联实现自监督LDCT去噪，具有优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

*Tatsuro Banno,Takehiko Ohkawa,Ruicong Liu,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个用于双手机器人活动的无标记3D手-身体基准数据集，通过多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合方法提供可靠的手部和上半身3D注册，证明手-身体联合建模比单独使用手部或身体信息能更好地识别双人活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手部或身体姿势，而基于标记的运动捕捉方法会引入视觉伪影，限制了模型在自然无标记视频上的泛化能力。双人活动涉及手部和身体的协调运动，但这种协调对活动理解的影响尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 构建从同步多视角视频进行3D姿势标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，获得可靠的手部和上半身3D注册。验证不同输入表示（视频、手部姿势、身体姿势或手-身体姿势）在图卷积或时空注意力模型上的表现。

Result: 基于姿势的动作推断比视频基线更高效和准确。手部和身体线索的联合建模比单独使用手部或上半身能更好地进行动作识别，突出了建模相互依赖的手-身体动态对于双人活动整体理解的重要性。

Conclusion: AssemblyHands-X基准数据集填补了双人活动理解中手-身体协调研究的空白，证明了联合建模手部和身体动态对于准确识别双人活动的重要性。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘(CCU)框架，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离三个组件，解决多模态应用中视觉遗忘导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用中视觉模态最易泄露隐私，现有遗忘方法在视觉遗忘时会破坏跨模态知识和类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能下降。

Method: CCU框架包含：(a)选择性视觉遗忘：使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原语义；(b)跨模态知识保留：通过语义一致性保持其他模态的判别性；(c)双集对比分离：隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动以保持模型性能。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CCU相比最佳基线方法，准确率提升7.12%，且仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU框架能有效解决多模态视觉遗忘中的跨模态知识损失和结构稳定性问题，显著提升性能并减少计算开销。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

TL;DR: 提出Q-FSRU模型，结合频率谱表示融合和量子检索增强生成技术，用于医学视觉问答任务，在VQA-RAD数据集上表现优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决需要图像和文本理解的临床难题是医疗AI的主要挑战，现有方法在处理复杂医学推理时仍有局限。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将医学图像和文本特征转换到频域，结合量子检索系统从外部知识源获取医学事实，融合频域特征进行推理。

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上评估，Q-FSRU模型优于早期模型，特别是在需要图像文本推理的复杂病例上表现突出。

Conclusion: 频率和量子信息的结合提高了性能和可解释性，为构建智能、清晰的医疗AI工具提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于医学影像基础模型的持续学习框架，通过结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固，避免存储患者样本，实现隐私保护和高效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要随时间适应，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制，需要一种既能保护隐私又能持续学习的方法。

Method: 使用紧凑的Vision Transformer骨干网络，结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固，避免存储患者样本，在八个MedMNIST v2任务和CheXpert数据集上评估。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少超过30%的遗忘，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知的持续适应提供了一条实用路径，分析显示遗忘与重放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移两个可测量因素相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效解决联邦学习中医疗图像模态异构问题，提升模型在多个域上的泛化能力

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统性地从基准测试到奖励建模再到强化学习训练，证明了高保真、领域专业化的奖励模型是释放强化学习在图像编辑领域全部潜力的关键。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Conclusion: MoReact方法有效解决了文本驱动的人类反应生成问题，通过解耦轨迹和运动生成实现了更好的语义对齐和互动真实性。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

Motivation: 多任务学习潜力常因任务干扰导致的优化不平衡而受限，现有优化方法在不同数据集上表现不一致，且先进架构仍需依赖昂贵的网格搜索损失权重。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，验证现有优化方法性能，研究视觉基础模型和数据量的影响，分析优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数的相关性，并提出基于梯度范数的损失缩放策略。

Result: 发现优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数强相关；基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略能达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能；视觉基础模型和增加数据量对解决优化不平衡效果有限。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是解决多任务学习优化不平衡的更直接路径，而非开发日益复杂的方法。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本引导图像修复中占主导地位，但其在潜在空间建模整个图像的特性导致结果难以与提示细节良好对齐并保持背景一致性。

Method: 使用掩码自回归模型，引入双流编码器信息融合（DEIF）在频域融合文本和背景的语义和上下文信息，以及自适应解码器注意力增强（ADAE）来增强对引导标记和修复标记的注意力分数。

Conclusion: Token Painter方法在无需训练的情况下，能够生成与文本提示忠实对齐且与背景和谐的修复内容，显著提升了文本引导图像修复的性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Motivation: 深度视觉网络将概念表示为潜在空间中的方向（概念嵌入），但现有的矩阵分解、自编码器或字典学习方法依赖特征重建，无法直接获取编码-解码方向对。恢复这些方向对有助于理解、调试和改进模型。

Method: 通过方向聚类识别解码方向，通过信号向量估计编码方向，并利用网络权重通过不确定性区域对齐技术揭示影响预测的可解释方向。

Result: 在合成数据上恢复了真实方向对；在真实数据上，解码方向映射到单语义可解释概念且优于无监督基线；信号向量通过激活最大化验证了编码方向的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效恢复编码-解码方向对，为理解模型全局行为、解释个体预测以及进行干预生成反事实或纠正错误提供了应用可能。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Method: 1) 构建SAR-GEOVL-1M数据集，包含12万张图像和135个城市；2) 使用层次认知思维链生成对齐的结构化文本；3) 设计自一致迭代优化机制，通过对比、匹配和重建学习的自监督闭环增强跨模态对齐

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP的大规模多模态数据、可迁移模型架构和综合实验基准将显著推动SAR多模态基线模型的发展

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Conclusion: AutoPrune证明了复杂度自适应剪枝策略的有效性，能够显著降低视觉语言模型的计算需求，同时保持高性能，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动汽车损伤检测流程，通过将2D掩码提升到3D空间进行损伤分割，并引入无需学习的单视图3D高斯泼溅分割方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车保险行业需要快速准确的损伤评估，现有方法多基于2D图像分析，而3D重建方法能提供更全面和几何精确的损伤表示。3D高斯泼溅技术能从有限视角生成准确连贯的3D重建。

Method: 使用结构从运动获取相机参数，将高斯投影到图像平面，通过Z缓冲和深度、不透明度的正态分布模型进行过滤，实现单视图3D高斯泼溅分割。

Result: 该方法在汽车损伤检测等挑战性场景中特别有效，特别是当目标物体（如划痕、小凹陷）仅在单个视图中清晰可见时，多视图一致性方法不适用的情况。

Conclusion: 提出的无需学习方法能够有效处理单视图3D分割问题，特别是在汽车损伤检测等实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在视觉质量和时间一致性方面有所改进，但在准确建模人类指定动作方面的能力仍有待探索。直接应用强化学习后训练方法面临大规模偏好标注成本过高和构建基于规则的视频验证器不可行的问题。

Method: 使用逆向动力学模型将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过从生成视频中恢复输入动作来提供可验证的奖励信号，并采用组相对策略优化进行优化。

Result: 在自回归和扩散范式上的实验显示，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量改善高达10%，并获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，在多个指标上均取得显著改进。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道提供了最先进的甲状腺超声分类，具有强大的泛化能力和适合临床集成的实用运行特性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

TL;DR: 提出VFSI方法，在扩散采样过程中通过能量引导强制执行物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通仿真的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通仿真虽然逼真，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹存在碰撞、偏离道路等问题，需要解决物理有效性这一根本局限。

Method: 采用基于能量的引导方法，将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，在扩散去噪过程中引导生成物理有效的轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo数据集200个城市场景中，VFSI将碰撞率降低67%（24.6%到8.1%），整体有效性提高87%（50.3%到94.2%），同时改进真实度指标（ADE从1.34m降至1.21m）。

Conclusion: 在推理过程中显式强制执行约束对于物理有效的交通仿真既是必要的也是充分的，模型无关的方法证明了这一点。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，这会增加计算开销和学习负担。

Method: 采用注意力专业化路由机制，根据注意力头的内在行为将其分配到不同模式；提出渐进式训练策略，从时间一致退化开始训练，逐步转向不一致设置。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，相比SeedVR2等一步扩散基线模型提供6.2倍加速。

Conclusion: OASIS通过减少冗余和有效保留预训练知识，使扩散模型更好地适应视频超分辨率任务，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法利用基础模型的零样本鲁棒性，实现了无需训练的360度深度估计，并保持了3D结构完整性。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance

TL;DR: TREAT-Net是一个多模态深度学习框架，利用超声心动图视频和临床记录预测急性冠脉综合征的治疗方案，旨在替代侵入性的冠状动脉造影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉造影虽然是诊断急性冠脉综合征的金标准，但其侵入性和资源密集性可能导致治疗延迟。需要开发非侵入性的替代方法，特别是在医疗资源有限的地区。

Method: TREAT-Net整合了表格引导的交叉注意力机制来增强视频解读，并使用后期融合机制对齐不同模态的预测。模型在9000多例ACS病例数据集上训练。

Result: 模型表现优于单模态和非融合基线，平衡准确率达到67.6%，AUROC为71.1%。跨模态一致性分析显示介入治疗预测准确率为88.6%。

Conclusion: TREAT-Net有潜力成为非侵入性的患者分流工具，特别是在冠状动脉造影资源有限的欠服务人群中实现及时准确的患者分类。

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Motivation: 当前方法缺乏通过文本对表情进行细粒度、直观控制的能力，难以从单张图像生成高保真3D头部化身。

Method: 提出新颖的条件调节方案融合图像身份特征和文本语义嵌入，引入基于预训练表情分类器的感知表情损失函数来正则化生成过程。

Result: 在单张消费级GPU上显著提升了可控性和真实感，在身份保持和表情保真度方面优于竞争方法。

Conclusion: SIE3D框架成功实现了从单张图像和文本生成高质量、表情可控的3D头部化身，解决了现有方法在细粒度控制方面的不足。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

TL;DR: FrameMind是一个通过强化学习训练的端到端框架，使用帧交错思维链(FiCOT)让模型在推理过程中动态请求视觉信息，显著提升了视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型使用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现欠佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，采用多轮推理方式，模型在文本推理和主动视觉感知之间交替，使用工具提取目标帧或视频片段；提出动态分辨率帧采样(DRFS)和DRFS-GRPO算法来训练动态采样策略。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推进了灵活高效视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求机制，实现了更灵活高效的视频理解，为自适应视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高光谱图像的广义类别发现框架，通过原型子空间建模来更好地捕捉类别结构，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略无法很好地适用于高维且具有复杂光谱结构的高光谱图像

Method: 使用一组基向量为每个类别建模子空间表示，而不是单个原型向量，并施加基向量正交性和重构约束

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境下的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Motivation: 解决雾霾天气条件下物理信息退化和行人交互建模无效的问题，为智能交通系统在恶劣环境中的可靠感知提供新范式。

Method: 构建可微分大气散射模型解耦雾霾浓度与光衰减，设计自适应扫描状态空间模型进行特征提取，开发异构图注意力网络建模多粒度行人交互关系。

Result: 在浓雾场景下，minADE/minFDE指标分别降低37.2%和41.5%，推理速度比原生Mamba提升78%。

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣环境下的智能交通系统可靠感知提供了有效的建模范式，在雾霾天气行人轨迹预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer马赛克数据上学习图像重建，相比传统的后ISP sRGB图像处理，能获得更优的重建效果，并通过真实雨天场景数据集验证了该方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP处理会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围和模糊细节，这些损失是可以避免的。

Method: 使用原始Bayer马赛克数据进行学习，创建Raw-Rain真实雨天场景基准数据集，引入信息守恒评分(ICS)作为颜色不变性评估指标。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型将sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快且计算量减半。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持低层视觉采用ISP后处理范式，为端到端可学习相机管线打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Motivation: 现有超像素方法通常独立于聚类任务进行分割，产生的分区与后续聚类目标不一致，且子空间聚类在HSI分析中计算和内存成本高。

Method: 基于展开ADMM的自表示网络提供模型驱动信号，指导可微分超像素模块，联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类，每个超像素学习独特的紧凑度参数。

Result: 在基准HSI数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的聚类方法始终获得更优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架通过联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类，实现了聚类感知的分割，显著提升了HSI聚类性能。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在预训练视觉模型上使用单一任务数据进行剪枝，不仅能保持该任务性能，还能保留模型在未见任务上的零样本能力。微调剪枝后的模型可以同时提升原始任务性能并恢复未见过任务的性能。

Motivation: 预训练视觉模型虽然具有可迁移性，但计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，但当下游任务未知时面临挑战。本文旨在研究数据如何影响预训练模型的剪枝效果。

Method: 使用预训练视觉模型，在单一任务数据上进行剪枝初始化，然后评估模型在原始任务和未见任务上的零样本性能，以及微调后的性能恢复情况。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在单一任务上剪枝的模型仍能保持其在未见任务上的零样本性能。微调这些剪枝模型不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复未见过任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于大规模数据集预训练诱导的有利损失景观，表明预训练模型具有内在的鲁棒性，使得基于有限数据的剪枝仍能保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Result: 发现Grounding IDs能加强相关组件间的注意力，改善跨模态接地，减少幻觉，并作为符号机制解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，为模型可解释性和鲁棒性提供了实用改进。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Motivation: 质疑传统视频生成中逐帧预测的合理性，认为帧可能不是视频自回归的自然原子单元，需要探索更合适的预测单元。

Method: 提出VideoAR框架，支持多种预测单元：完整帧、关键细节帧、多尺度细化、时空立方体，特别关注时空立方体作为预测单元，允许自回归模型在空间和时间维度上同时操作。

Conclusion: 这项工作鼓励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方式，打破了逐帧约束的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩展输入帧和分割token，结合高效的压缩策略，显著提升了RVOS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Conclusion: EYE-DEX框架在视网膜疾病诊断中实现了专家级性能，通过可视化解释增强了临床医生的信任度，为AI辅助医疗诊断提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific
regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted
diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI系统在塑造审美规范中的偏见问题，即使从表面平衡的数据源也可能引入偏见，特别关注AI面部美感预测中的种族偏见。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验、事后Dunn分析）和跨数据集验证，在平衡的FairFace数据集上评估预测差异。

Result: 两个模型在不同族裔群体间都表现出显著的预测差异（p < 0.001），交叉验证显示算法放大了社会美感偏见而非缓解，仅4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均等标准。

Conclusion: 当前AI美感预测方法存在不足，需要制定缓解策略来开发更公平的美感技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法虽然采样步骤已减少到一步，但在推理效率方面仍有很大优化空间。

Method: 设计f16 VAE结构（空间压缩比为16），采用像素重排和通道复制进行上采样，提出下界引导训练策略使训练更稳定。

Result: 实验结果显示，FastVSR相比多步模型加速111.9倍，相比现有一步模型加速3.92倍。

Conclusion: FastVSR在保持视频超分辨率性能的同时，显著提升了推理效率，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧弯需要冠状面和矢状面评估，现有无辐射方法主要针对冠状面，矢状面评估仍依赖电离辐射

Method: 采用双阶段架构：先估计侧位脊柱结构，再合成X光片；引入基于注意力的FFC模块整合解剖特征，以及空间变形网络建模形态变化

Result: 生成解剖准确的X光片，在视觉保真度和定量指标上优于现有GAN方法

Conclusion: 为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了全面的AIS评估

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本信息量特别具有挑战性。

Method: 引入多方面信息量度量，结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性。差异-混淆不确定性量化局部特征融合时的类别方向性和结构稳定性，然后进行不确定性加权聚类以多样化不确定样本，最后校准多样性以最大化所选样本的全局多样性同时保持局部代表性。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集上的26个不同实验设置中，该方法相比最先进方法实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: DECERN方法能有效感知细粒度图像间的区分性并评估样本价值，在主动细粒度图像分类中表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 医疗图像分析中由于隐私问题难以获取大规模数据集，现有生成模型在3D医学图像上输出多样性有限，无法准确表示真实图像。

Method: 使用放射组学特征作为生成条件，GAN模型生成肿瘤掩膜，扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，支持用户指定大小、形状、纹理等特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成多样化的肿瘤图像，支持肿瘤移除、操作和重定位，在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于实现精准医疗，为乳腺癌治疗规划提供支持。

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出TaSe框架，通过解构语言表示来解决视觉语言模型在复杂查询感知方面的局限性，显著提升了基于语言的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在感知涉及描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时能力有限，主要源于文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其描述属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1）构建分层合成字幕数据集；2）Talk in Pieces模块将文本嵌入解构为对象、属性和关系三个子空间；3）See in Whole模块学习将解构组件聚合成分层结构化嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过解构语言表示并构建分层结构，TaSe框架增强了语言结构的归纳偏置，为基于语言的目标检测提供了细粒度的多模态表示。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种高效的3D深度学习框架T1C-RFlow，能够从多参数MRI预对比图像生成T1对比增强图像，避免了钆基对比剂的使用，并显著提高了生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中常用于增强病灶可视化，但存在肾源性系统性纤维化风险，且对比剂注射的变异性会导致成像不一致。因此需要开发无对比剂的替代方法。

Method: 提出3D潜在校正流(T1C-RFlow)模型：首先将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像输入预训练的自编码器获取潜在空间表示，然后在潜在空间中训练校正流扩散模型。使用BraTS 2024数据集进行训练。

Result: T1C-RFlow在定性和定量评估中均优于基准模型(pix2pix、DDPM、DiT-3D)，在胶质瘤、脑膜瘤和转移瘤数据集上获得优异指标，且去噪时间显著更快(6.9秒/体积)。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的合成T1C图像与真实图像高度相似，且生成时间远少于传统扩散模型，有望发展为脑肿瘤无对比剂MRI的实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total

TL;DR: BALR-SAM是一个边界感知低秩自适应框架，通过三个组件增强SAM在医学图像分割中的性能：细节增强网络、低秩适配器和低秩张量注意力机制，仅更新1.8%参数即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型如SAM在医学图像分割中表现不佳，需要高效的领域自适应方法，在保持高性能的同时最小化资源需求。

Method: 结合三个定制组件：互补细节增强网络（CDEN）捕获边界特征；低秩适配器优化医学上下文特征表示；低秩张量注意力机制减少内存使用。

Result: 在标准医学分割数据集上，无需提示即可超越包括完全微调的MedSAM在内的多个SOTA方法，仅更新11.7M参数（1.8%）。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM框架有效解决了SAM在医学图像分割中的领域适应问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%

Conclusion: Forge4D能够高效地从无标定稀疏视角视频重建时间对齐的4D人体表示，支持新视角和新时间合成。

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感视频面部分析领域数据有限，且扩展特性对多模态学习的影响尚未充分探索，同时需要更好地捕捉模态内和模态间的相关性。

Method: 采用双掩码策略、增强的模态编码器设计、迭代音频-视觉相关性学习模块，以及渐进式语义注入策略，将训练分为三个阶段。

Result: 在17个数据集上覆盖三个主要AVFA任务，实现了持续的最先进性能，消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++成功解决了AVFA中的扩展和相关性建模挑战，为情感分析系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world

Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频是构建有效世界模型和机器人基础模型的关键步骤，需要更好地利用动作参数来指导视频生成过程。

Method: 1. 动作缩放分类器自由指导：根据动作幅度动态调整指导强度，增强对运动强度的可控性；2. 动作缩放噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地与期望运动动态对齐。

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用显式动作参数来指导扩散模型的推理过程，可以有效提升机器人视频生成的动作一致性和视觉逼真度，为构建更好的世界模型和机器人基础模型提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR)新范式，在视觉嵌入空间进行自回归推理，显著提升感知密集型视觉问答任务的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将推理限制在语言空间，视觉信息被视为静态前提条件，存在根本性限制

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉标记，训练语言模型生成能重构关键视觉标记的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有显著提升

Conclusion: LVR显著改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力，为多模态推理提供了新的方向

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Motivation: 传统图像编解码器为人类视觉系统优化，不适合多模态大语言模型的需求。压缩失真对不同层级图像特征影响不均，导致下游任务性能下降。

Method: 编码器利用CLIP浅层注意力生成重要性图进行比特分配，保护关键语义区域；解码器集成轻量适配器，使用多级损失函数确保低层细节和高层语义的忠实重建。

Result: 在MLLM任务上保持相同性能的同时，实现了高达35.99%的码率节省，优于之前的SOTA神经编解码器。

Conclusion: CoTAM方法有效解决了MLLM的压缩需求，通过自适应特征保护和多级重建策略显著提升了压缩效率。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Result: 在视觉和非视觉任务上的广泛实验表明，S²NN在性能和效率上都优于现有的量化SNN。

Conclusion: S²NN在性能和效率方面表现出色，有望应用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对这些干扰敏感，配准精度降低。

Method: 集成骨架结构到配准过程中，结合损坏点云对齐和骨架对齐的变换结果；设计分布距离损失函数来强制源骨架和目标骨架的一致性。

Result: 在多种损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种损坏场景下（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: CEGC为挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一种可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging

Motivation: 解决3D分割中标注数据获取困难的问题，传统方法需要多视角图像、3D模型标注或文本描述，这些方式要么难以收集，要么标注成本高，要么描述不精确。

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高质量的3D分割，克服了传统方法的局限性，在分割精度和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

Motivation: 现有LVLMs在长视频推理中存在统一帧采样和静态文本推理的局限性，导致效率低下且难以处理视觉密集型视频任务。

Conclusion: FrameThinker通过迭代式视频推理和精心设计的训练策略，在长视频理解任务中实现了前所未有的效率和效果，为LVLMs的长视频推理能力提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa是一个端到端框架，联合优化三角形网格和2D高斯溅射，通过灵活的绑定策略解决室内无纹理区域几何重建不准确的问题，并集成网格约束和单目法线监督来正则化几何学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限性：(i) 在无纹理室内区域几何重建不准确；(ii) 网格提取与优化分离，错失了利用网格几何指导溅射优化的机会。

Method: 提出OMeGa框架，通过灵活绑定策略联合优化三角形网格和2D高斯溅射，将高斯溅射的空间属性表达在网格框架中，纹理属性保留在溅射上。集成网格约束和单目法线监督，并提出启发式迭代网格细化策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的室内重建基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比2DGS基线将Chamfer-L1降低了47.3%，同时保持有竞争力的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前在室内无纹理重建中的局限性，证明了联合优化网格和溅射的可行性。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

<details>

Motivation: 冷冻电镜断层扫描(cryo-ET)的原位结构可视化受到注释稀缺、严重噪声和泛化能力差的限制，需要开发能够有效应对这些挑战的基础模型。

Method: 1) 开发CryoEngine合成数据生成器，产生904k个子断层图；2) 设计APT-ViT模型，通过自适应相位标记增强等变性；3) 提出NRCL策略，在严重噪声条件下稳定表示学习。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了冷冻电镜断层扫描中子断层图分析的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为基础模型在该领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征度量方法可能遗漏复杂的互相关关系，而相关度量方法由于处理4D相关图导致计算成本高昂。需要一种既能建模复杂相关性又保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 采用选择性状态空间模型，实现相似性感知的选择性扫描机制，基于Mamba的线性复杂度算法有效优化4D相关图，同时保持特征图分辨率和感受野。

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中，MambaMatcher实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MambaMatcher通过选择性状态空间模型成功克服了传统方法的局限性，在语义对应任务中取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能农业中拥挤场景下动物计数困难的问题，特别是由于遮挡和有限相机视角导致的计数不准确。

Method: 使用三平面融合的多视角鸡只计数框架，提取单视角特征，通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: 在真实养殖条件下构建首个多视角丝羽鸡数据集，实验显示TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，在密集遮挡场景下达到95.1%的准确率和强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TP-MVCC模型在智能农业中具有实际应用潜力，能够有效解决拥挤场景下的动物计数问题。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR通过将AR模型的输入输出约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了VAE潜在空间中异质方差导致的方差崩溃问题，在图像生成任务中显著提升了自回归模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续token自回归模型在图像生成中通常落后于潜在扩散和掩码生成模型，主要原因是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在AR解码过程中被放大，特别是在分类器无关引导下容易导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，核心设计是将所有AR输入输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE，通过超球面约束移除尺度分量来稳定AR解码。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务中，SphereAR-H（943M）达到FID 1.34，创下AR模型新纪录；较小的SphereAR-L（479M）和SphereAR-B（208M）分别达到FID 1.54和1.92，超越或匹配了更大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个在可比参数规模下，纯next-token自回归图像生成器在光栅顺序上超越扩散和掩码生成模型的工作，证明了超球面约束对稳定AR解码的有效性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自反思、自改进的多智能体框架，用于解决农业视觉问答中多图像输入和外部知识缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像互补视角和生长阶段信息的真实农业场景，且缺乏对外部农业知识的动态获取能力。

Method: 构建包含检索器、反思器、回答器和改进器的四角色多智能体框架，通过协作实现上下文丰富、反思推理、答案草拟和迭代改进。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和知识缺失问题，通过自反思和自改进机制提升系统性能。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一个隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频。该框架包含两个阶段：基于超网络的标记器将视频编码为神经参数空间，以及隐式扩散变换器在潜在INR权重上进行去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频标记器将视频编码为逐帧特征图，而NeRV-Diffusion将视频整体压缩并生成为一个统一的神经网络，避免了去噪器中的时间跨帧注意力，并通过专用解码器解码视频潜在表示。

Method: 1) 超网络标记器将原始视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2) 隐式扩散变换器在潜在INR权重上进行去噪；3) 重用瓶颈潜在跨所有NeRV层，重新设计权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标；4) 引入SNR自适应损失加权和计划采样。

Result: NeRV-Diffusion在真实世界视频基准测试（UCF-101和Kinetics-600）上达到了优于先前INR基模型的视频生成质量，与最近最先进的非隐式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的视频合成，并带来了平滑的INR权重空间，便于帧间或视频间的无缝插值。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的多器官分割方法存在计算成本高和局部细节提取不足的问题，需要重新设计特征提取模块来平衡性能和复杂度。

Method: 提出U型网络LamFormer，使用线性注意力Mamba模块捕获多尺度长距离依赖，构建并行层次特征聚合模块整合不同层次特征，设计简化Transformer全局建模上采样特征。

Result: 在7个复杂多样的数据集上优于现有分割方法，在模型性能和复杂度之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: LamFormer通过创新的模块设计有效解决了Transformer在医学图像分割中的计算成本和局部细节问题，展现出优异的性能表现。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种通过破坏梯度共识来增强对抗鲁棒性的防御方法，使用可学习滤波器集合来最大化梯度分歧，在保持自然预测的同时显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，现有防御在梯度可估计时容易失效。研究发现梯度共识是导致对抗可迁移性的关键因素，攻击者利用这种共识构造跨变换有效的扰动。

Method: 提出DRIFT防御框架，使用轻量级可学习滤波器随机集成，通过共识分歧训练策略结合预测一致性、雅可比分离、logit空间分离和对抗鲁棒性，主动破坏梯度共识。

Result: 在ImageNet上对CNN和Vision Transformer均取得显著鲁棒性提升，在自适应白盒攻击、迁移攻击和梯度无关攻击下优于现有预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法。

Conclusion: 梯度分歧作为对抗防御的实用且可泛化原则，DRIFT以可忽略的运行时和内存成本实现了实质性鲁棒性改进。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于共享自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这源于图像和文本底层统计特性的根本差异。

Method: 采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数进行高级语义融合。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了优越的训练效率；扩展到3B参数时，匹配或超越了7B基于AR的UMMs，在图像生成、文本和视觉理解任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出R²M框架，通过模型融合解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新伪造方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，使得数据收集和重新训练变得不切实际。模型融合自然适合深度伪造检测，因为不同伪造方法的检测器共享相同的二元决策，仅在伪造特征上有所不同。

Method: 提出Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M)：通过低秩分解估计共享的真实成分，将每个专家模型分解为真实对齐部分和伪造残差，使用层级秩截断对残差去噪，并通过每任务范数匹配聚合以防止单一生成器主导。

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他融合基线。框架具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家模型并重新融合，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: R²M提供了一种高效且可扩展的深度伪造检测解决方案，通过模型融合有效适应不断演变的伪造技术，同时保持检测性能。

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based

consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as

Method: 使用DINOv2提取图像视觉特征，在patch级别融合视觉和几何特征，提出混合位置编码来同时编码图像空间和点云空间的位置信息。

Conclusion: DINOReg通过充分融合视觉和几何信息，显著提升了点云配准性能，证明了视觉基础模型在3D计算机视觉任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，通过问题改写和问题字幕生成两种策略，从现有的问答对中合成更丰富的监督信号，以提升视频问答模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视频问答监督信号是孤立的问答对，这种"事实袋"方法无法捕捉事件的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深层理解。

Method: 1. 问题改写：将视频现有问答对中的多样化问题合成为重建视频事件结构的整体叙事段落；2. 问题字幕生成：为每个问题生成细粒度的视觉理由，将答案基于具体的相关证据。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性：将3B模型在STAR上的准确率提升至72.5%（+4.9%），将7B模型在NExT-QA上的准确率提升至80.8%。

Conclusion: 从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和基于理由的数据合成，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级遥感图像缺乏足够高质量标注数据集，现有标注方法不可靠或成本过高，限制了大规模土地覆盖制图的应用。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多实例同时标注的MCAE方法。

Result: 构建了HiCity-LC数据集，覆盖中国5个主要城市，分类精度超过85%，是首个公开的亚米级城市级土地覆盖基准。

Conclusion: MCAE方法具有可扩展性和实用性，为大规模亚米级制图提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出将欧几里得几何问题解决作为空间智能的代理任务，构建了包含3万个平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，通过GRPO方法微调多模态大语言模型，显著提升了模型在多个空间推理基准测试中的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能（包括形状可视化、物体心理旋转、位置关系判断等）是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，需要找到有效方法来提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 构建Euclid30K多模态数据集，包含约3万个几何问题；使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法微调Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型，让模型学习识别形状、计数、关联实体并进行基于欧几里得原理的多步演绎推理。

Result: 经过Euclid30K训练的模型在四个空间推理基准测试（Super-CLEVR、Omni3DBench、VSI-Bench、MindCube）上实现了显著的零样本性能提升。所有评估模型的VSI-Bench平均准确率从34.5%提升到40.5%，提高了5.5个百分点。其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%的准确率，超越了之前的SOTA模型Spatial-MLLM。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明，以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型赋予广泛可迁移的空间技能，欧几里得几何问题解决是提升多模态大语言模型空间推理能力的有效代理任务。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督框架，用于解决程序视频学习中的背景片段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界教学视频包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这种变异性违反了传统对齐方法的强单调性假设。现有方法仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 使用正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输(R-FPGWOT)，联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，结合序列间对比学习稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，同时产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN能够有效处理教学视频中的噪声和变异性，保持关键步骤顺序并过滤噪声，在程序学习任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入实现了有效的3D场景理解，无需依赖外部3D数据，为3D多模态大语言模型的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶出租车的商业部署，需要可靠检测弱势道路使用者（如行人、骑自行车者等），而高质量数据对于训练和评估此类系统至关重要。

Method: 基于SMIRK合成数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK数据集，使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）将多维场景特征转换为特征模式，并与MoreSMIRK中的条目进行匹配。

Result: 在包含150多个手动标注行人过街视频的真实世界数据集PIE上评估，PCICF能成功识别和分类复杂的行人过街情境，即使行人群体合并或分离时也能有效工作。

Conclusion: PCICF通过计算高效的组件（如SFCs）具有在自动驾驶出租车上用于ODD检测的潜力，并提供了开源复现包。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然生成质量优秀，但模型规模和复杂性限制了在边缘设备上的部署。现有的后训练量化方法会导致性能下降，需要一种有效的量化方法来平衡压缩效率和性能保持。

Method: 1. 交叉块校准(CBC)：获取更准确的校准数据；2. 正交平滑(OBS)：量化通道异常值并使用块Hadamard矩阵平滑；3. 跨层参数搜索(CLPS)：搜索最优参数。

Result: 成功将模型压缩到W4A4量化，视觉质量和指标仅有轻微下降，实现3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了扩散变换器的量化问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了部署效率，为边缘设备上的DiTs应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域数据集质量评估的系统性研究仍然有限。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集分析常见质量问题，集成CleanVision和Fastdup工具，引入自动阈值选择等增强功能，将低质量图像检测建模为二分类任务。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下将F1分数从0.6794提升到0.9468，在双扰动下从0.7447提升到0.8557；去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升到0.7928。

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络对模糊和严重下采样等掩盖关键视觉特征的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程有效提升了数据质量评估效果。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射方法在遮挡区域存在冗余，缺乏遮挡感知导致渲染效率和质量不足

Method: 使用快速代理系统生成精确遮挡深度图，指导锚点和高斯剔除，并在训练期间引导表面致密化

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，渲染速度比Octree-GS快2.5倍以上，渲染质量显著提升

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过遮挡感知有效解决了3D高斯溅射中的冗余问题，实现了渲染速度和质量的双重提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了MMRQA框架，将多模态大语言模型与信号处理结合，用于MRI质量评估，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI质量评估方法存在局限性：基于信号的方法缺乏语义理解，而深度学习方法牺牲了可解释性。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强的稳健指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对、通过LoRA实现参数高效融合。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，该框架生成临床可解释的输出，增强了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFlow是一个新颖的无监督跨模态光流估计框架，采用解耦优化策略和跨模态一致性约束，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计的问题，特别是处理模态差异和几何不对齐的挑战。

Method: 提出解耦优化策略，协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；使用几何感知数据合成流程和抗异常值损失；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: 实验结果表明DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异和几何不对齐问题，在无监督设置下表现出色。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UI2V-Bench，一个专注于语义理解和推理的图像到视频生成模型评估基准，包含空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理四个维度，使用MLLM进行自动评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，但忽略了模型对输入图像特定主题语义的理解能力以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识。

Method: 设计了基于多模态大语言模型的两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解管道和基于反馈的推理管道，包含约500个精心构建的文本-图像对。

Result: 评估了多个开源和闭源的I2V模型，人类评估与提出的MLLM指标高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了I2V评估在语义理解和推理能力方面的关键空白，为未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需构建世界概念的启发，旨在创建可根据用户探索动态渲染高真实感区域的虚拟世界，克服传统全局世界生成或2D幻觉方法的局限性。

Method: 采用混合场景结构：关键前景对象使用完整3D表示，背景和非交互区域使用2D合成；结合先进的表示学习和对象到3D技术，支持自然语言命令控制对象外观和动态。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法；能够随着用户交互逐步展开虚拟世界，提供动态、沉浸式的视觉连贯探索体验。

Conclusion: NeoWorld框架成功实现了从单张图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界，通过混合3D/2D表示在保证效率的同时提供灵活视角操控和物理合理的场景动画，为用户带来渐进式展开的沉浸式探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出基于知识蒸馏的双模型集成方法，通过教师-学生架构结合编码器-解码器和编码器-编码器模型，实现工业异常检测和语义异常检测的统一框架，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测方法存在领域偏差问题，工业检测方法难以泛化到语义异常检测，反之亦然。现有通用异常检测方法对数据集设置敏感，且主要针对单类别任务。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏的双模型集成框架：教师模型指导两个学生模型——编码器-解码器模型专注于工业异常检测中的局部缺陷，编码器-编码器模型优化语义异常检测。两者共享DINOv2预训练编码器，通过Noisy-OR目标联合学习，结合局部和语义异常分数得到最终异常分数。

Result: 在8个公开基准测试中评估，包括MVTec-AD、MVTec-LOCO、VisA、Real-IAD（工业检测）和CIFAR-10/100、FMNIST、View（语义检测）。在单类别和多类别设置下均达到最先进性能：MVTec-AD图像级AUROC 99.7%，CIFAR-10达97.8%，优于现有通用模型甚至部分专业模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了跨多个异常检测领域的泛化能力，在工业检测和语义异常检测任务中均表现出色，为通用异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于Laban运动分析的零样本推理时优化方法，用于在文本引导的运动生成模型中实现细粒度的表达性运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法在实现细粒度表达性运动控制方面存在挑战，主要由于数据集缺乏运动风格多样性和自然语言难以表达定量特征。受Laban运动分析的启发，希望实现可解释的表达性运动控制。

Method: 提出了零样本推理时优化方法，将Laban Effort和Shape组件的量化方法无缝集成到文本引导的运动生成模型中，通过在采样步骤更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入来引导生成具有所需Laban组件的运动。

Result: 该方法能够生成多样化的表达性运动质量，同时保持运动身份，成功根据目标Laban标签操纵运动属性。

Conclusion: 通过集成Laban运动分析方法，实现了对运动生成的可解释和表达性控制，解决了细粒度运动控制的挑战。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要贡献者，促进二手市场发展具有重要意义。机器学习方法在大规模评估二手服装价值方面发挥重要作用，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，捕捉服装的关键特征和内部变异性。提出基于邻域同质性一致性得分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非特征性样本。在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上评估。

Result: 通过战略性修剪和选择图像的代表性向量，实现了性能与效率的权衡。检索系统在保持接近最优准确性的同时，通过减少添加到向量数据库的图像数量大幅降低计算成本。异常值去除方法应用于聚类技术可获得更高的检索性能。

Conclusion: 选择性表示框架能够有效缩小二手服装图像数据库规模而不牺牲检索准确性，为二手市场的可扩展性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的视觉幻觉问题，即生成的回答与视觉证据相矛盾。现有的直接偏好优化方法难以捕捉细粒度语义差异并容易导致捷径学习。

Method: 构建基于语义难度排序的课程偏好对数据集，采用动态参考模型和双向对称目标，从文本和视觉偏好同时学习。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中，SCPO将幻觉率降低了高达62.9%，在保持通用能力的同时提高了事实准确性。

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的MLLM对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在模态依赖不平衡问题，当主导模态在真实场景中退化时，整体性能显著下降，因此模态平衡成为实际多模态分割的关键挑战。

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块实现模态均衡编码，设计自引导模块通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过平衡模态贡献和引入相互引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench是首个针对不同临床就诊间患者状况变化分析的基准测试，挑战大型视觉语言模型在时序医学图像上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要基于单次就诊图像分析患者状况，这与临床实践中医生参考患者历史状况进行综合评估的现实不符。

Method: 构建包含三个任务（视觉问答、报告生成、图像对选择）的测试集和超过17,000个实例的知识语料库，评估6个专有和6个开源LVLM。

Result: 大多数LVLM缺乏分析时序医学图像中患者状况变化的能力，在闭卷设置中很大比例仅达到随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有不足。多模态检索增强比无检索和仅文本检索带来更高性能提升。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时序医学图像推理方面的局限性，并指出多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多目标场景中的图像编辑经常失败，无法有效处理目标数量和空间布局的约束。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：ILFM将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；CMAM将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入并改善指令跟随。

Result: 在构建的QL-Dataset基准测试中，QL-Adapter在数量和布局一致的图像编辑任务上达到最先进性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过融合布局先验和跨模态特征增强，有效解决了复杂多目标场景中的图像编辑挑战。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本数学问题转换为视觉形式来评估视觉语言模型在数学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉数学推理基准往往局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，并且很少评估跨多图像的推理能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程结合人工标注，将GSM8K文本数据集中的样本系统性地映射为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示现有VLM在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和泛化VLM的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在扩散预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提高训练稳定性和效率，在多个数据集上实现最先进的少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型如一致性模型和平均流模型虽然能实现少步生成，但训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。从预训练扩散模型初始化仍有挑战，需要将无限小步转换为长跳跃映射。

Method: 引入中间训练概念，在扩散预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段。CMT训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，获得轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的两步FID：CIFAR-10为1.97，ImageNet 64x64为1.32，ImageNet 512x512为1.84。相比一致性模型，节省高达98%的训练数据和GPU时间。在ImageNet 256x256上，一步FID达到3.34，总训练时间比从头训练平均流模型减少约50%。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原则性、高效且通用的框架，显著提高了训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进掩码生成和语义编码策略，有效提升了3D场景理解的性能，特别是在复杂环境中的表现。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种模型进行了统一的理论和实验验证，证明了Diffusion Bridge的成本函数更低，能引导系统走向更稳定和自然的轨迹，而Flow Matching在小训练数据下效果会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种方法在任意分布转换中表现优异但缺乏统一理论比较的问题，澄清哪种方法更优以及各自优缺点。

Method: 通过随机最优控制理论重新构建两种模型框架，从最优传输角度分析Flow Matching的插值系数问题，并设计基于潜在Transformer的新型Diffusion Bridge架构，在相同结构下与Flow Matching进行公平比较。

Result: 在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、转换和风格迁移等任务上的综合实验表明，Diffusion Bridge在分布差异较大时表现更好，而Flow Matching在小训练数据下效果下降，实验结果与理论预测完全一致。

Conclusion: 研究明确了两种模型的相对优劣：Diffusion Bridge成本函数更低、轨迹更稳定自然，而Flow Matching在小训练数据下插值系数效率降低，为实际应用提供了指导依据。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合大气散射物理先验的雾天人群计数方法，通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，提升复杂气象条件下的计数精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对雾天环境中人群计数面临的长距离目标模糊、局部特征退化、图像对比度衰减等关键挑战，需要开发能够应对复杂气象条件的鲁棒计数方法。

Method: 1) 引入可微分大气散射模型，采用透射率动态估计和散射参数自适应校准技术；2) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理设计MSA-KAN，构建可学习边缘激活函数；3) 提出天气感知GCN，利用MSA-KAN提取的深度特征动态构建空间邻接矩阵。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，在浓雾场景下，该方法相比主流算法在MAE指标上实现了12.2%-27.5%的降低。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理机制与数据驱动的有效融合，显著提升了雾天环境下人群计数的准确性和鲁棒性，为解决复杂气象条件下的视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的新型后门攻击方法，通过微妙地破坏模型对对象关系的理解能力，而非强制生成固定目标内容，实现更隐蔽的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法使用固定目标模式，容易被检测，因为模型会在训练数据中记忆这些频繁模式并表现出过度自信。需要开发更隐蔽的后门攻击方法。

Method: 在训练期间向选定样本注入视觉触发器，并同时交换对应文本回答中关键标记的语法角色。采用自适应标记加权损失来强调交换标记的学习，将视觉触发器与词袋行为关联起来。

Result: 在多个基准测试和各种LVLM架构上，TokenSwap实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的规避性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap通过关注LVLM的组合理解能力，而非强制固定目标内容，提供了一种更隐蔽的后门攻击方法，突显了现有防御机制的局限性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一种基于扩散模型的类别级物体姿态估计方法，利用DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，无需离散类别标签，在合成训练和真实世界应用中都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，机器人会遇到未知物体，需要语义理解来泛化到已知类别及之外。现有方法依赖离散类别标签，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征与逼真训练数据，通过交叉注意力注入连续语义先验，学习跨物体实例的规范化坐标系系统。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，5°5cm指标相对提升31.9%；在两个实例级数据集上展示了超越已知类别的泛化能力，抓取未知类别物体的成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验有效缩小了Sim2Real差距，实现了对已知和未知类别物体的准确姿态估计，为开放环境中的机器人操作提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Motivation: 解决面部-颅骨配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足以及颅面畸形患者代表性不足的问题，为远程诊断、手术规划等医疗应用提供支持。

Method: 构建包含正常和罕见颅面状况的数据集；提出密集射线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性；开发双向面部-颅骨可变形模型，通过共享系数空间实现形状推断并建模组织厚度变化。

Result: 实验证实了方法的鲁棒性和准确性，能够从单张图像进行3D面部-颅骨重建并支持手术规划预测。

Conclusion: BFSM模型在医疗应用中具有巨大潜力，解决了数据稀缺和配准精度问题，特别关注了颅面畸形患者的代表性。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了YOLOv11模型在细粒度外周血涂片检测中的表现，创建了包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大规模数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析既耗时又主观，而深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等最先进模型在细粒度PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大规模标注数据集（16,891张图像，12个外周血细胞类别），对五个YOLOv11变体（从Nano到XLarge）进行综合评估，采用两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10），使用mAP、精确度、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等多重性能标准。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。较大模型（Large和XLarge）仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加。8:1:1分割在所有模型中始终优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11，特别是Medium变体，是自动化细粒度PBS检测的高效框架。公开的数据集为血液学中血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

<details>

Motivation: 传统运动分析依赖人工标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种能够自动提取相关动力学变量的鲁棒时序分割方法。

Method: 将结构化最优传输（SOT）概念应用于注意力时空图卷积网络（ASTGCN），实现上下文感知的时序分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无人监督方法。发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种有效的无人监督时序分割解决方案，特别适用于需要精细生物力学分析的体育项目。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练即可实现强大的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器，这限制了它们的通用性和实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段检索：首先从模型直接获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态大语言模型经过精心利用后，无需训练即可作为强大的检索引擎，填补了其作为通用模型角色的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，测试人类和视觉语言模型重新排列片段为连贯序列的能力。结果显示VLMs与人类表现存在显著差距，且更依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在事件推理方面存在不足，需要专门的基准来评估其在时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理等多维度的能力。

Method: 从COIN教学视频数据集中筛选3,381个视频，分为12个类别和180个子类别，分割成11,423个事件片段。让人类参与者和VLMs重新排列这些片段，评估其推理能力。

Result: 人类表现显著优于VLMs。文本描述能提升模型准确率但不影响人类表现，表明模型更依赖语言先验。VLMs在时间因果推理主导的视频中表现较好，在日常任务中优于专业任务。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉推理方面仍面临挑战，特别是在空间和上下文推理方面。需要开发更强大的视觉理解能力，而不仅仅是依赖语言先验。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

TL;DR: RIFLE是一个基于扩散模型的框架，专门用于去除屏幕照片中的闪烁条纹（flicker-banding）伪影，同时保留图像细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 屏幕照片中的闪烁条纹伪影严重影响可读性和感知质量，但该问题研究不足，需要专门的恢复方法。

Method: 提出闪烁条纹先验估计器（FPE）预测关键条纹属性并注入恢复网络，使用掩码损失（ML）集中监督条纹区域，并提供模拟管道合成训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，RIFLE在定量指标和视觉比较中始终优于现有图像重建基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究闪烁条纹模拟和去除的工作，为后续研究在数据集构建和去除模型设计方面奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,

Abstract: This paper introduces Volterra Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(VNODE), a piecewise continuous Volterra Neural Network that integrates
nonlinear Volterra filtering with continuous time neural ordinary differential
equations for image classification. Drawing inspiration from the visual cortex,
where discrete event processing is interleaved with continuous integration,
VNODE alternates between discrete Volterra feature extraction and ODE driven

requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and
Imagenet1K.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分类器中心的自适应框架，通过轻量级文本适配器和分层非对称初始化来增强分类组件，从而显著提升开放词汇伪装目标分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇伪装目标分割对模型泛化能力要求极高，现有方法的分类组件严重影响整体分割性能，需要针对性改进。

Method: 采用分类器中心的自适应框架，通过轻量级文本适配器和分层非对称初始化技术来增强分类组件。

Result: 在OVCamo基准测试中，相比OVCoser基线，cIoU从0.443提升到0.493，cSm从0.579提升到0.658，cMAE从0.336降低到0.239。

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为提升伪装目标分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于nnUNet框架的自动分割管道，用于在T1加权MRI扫描中检测和分割中重度创伤性脑损伤(TBI)病灶，在AIMS-TBI 2025挑战赛中排名前六。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中重度创伤性脑损伤(TBI)病灶在神经影像中识别和分割具有挑战性，这些病灶在大小、数量和偏侧性方面存在极端异质性，影响了图像配准和脑分区等下游处理任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 开发了一个有效的自动分割管道用于TBI病灶分割，Python实现已公开可用，该方法在挑战赛中表现优异。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SANA-Video是一个小型扩散模型，能够高效生成720x1280分辨率、分钟级时长的视频，具有快速生成速度和良好的文本-视频对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、生成速度慢的问题，实现低成本的分钟级高质量视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制(Linear DiT)和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 在64个H100 GPU上仅需12天训练，成本仅为MovieGen的1%，生成速度比同类模型快16倍，可在RTX 5090 GPU上部署。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过显式推理物理不合理性来引导视频生成，提高物理逼真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖大规模文本-视频数据集隐式学习物理推理，成本高、难以扩展，且容易产生违反物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 使用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导策略，包括同步方向归一化和轨迹解耦去噪。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提高了物理保真度，同时保持照片真实感，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的即插即用的物理感知视频生成范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IWR-Bench基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型从视频重建交互式网页的能力，包含113个任务，涵盖100个真实网站和1001个交互动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中关键的动态交互特性。

Method: 构建包含用户交互视频和静态资源的基准，采用代理评判框架和综合指标系统自动评估生成网页的功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 对28个LVLM的广泛实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅为36.35%，功能正确性（24.39%）远低于视觉保真度（64.25%）。

Conclusion: 当前模型在推理时间动态性和合成事件驱动逻辑方面存在严重局限，IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究设立了具有挑战性的前沿。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了偏振成像在分割水面漂浮碎片方面的效果，发现偏振线索能提高低对比度物体的分割精度并抑制反射导致的误报，但会增加计算负担和新的误报风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受到水面反光和户外光照变化的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: 在公开数据集PoTATO上对最先进的融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的误报，提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差，但增加了模型大小和计算负载。

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究人员判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Motivation: 解决现有医学视觉语言模型在影像模态多样性和多语言临床数据方面的局限性，特别是PET/CT数据和越南语的缺乏。

Method: 构建大规模越南语多模态医学数据集，并引入包含数据增强和专家验证测试集的训练框架。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试将推动医学影像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境中，提升在越南医疗中的临床相关性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的三模态（RGB、深度、热红外）目标跟踪任务，构建了RGBDT500数据集，并开发了RDTTrack跟踪器，通过正交投影约束和提示学习技术融合三模态信息，在复杂场景中显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法（如RGB-D或RGB-T）在复杂场景中因输入模态有限而面临挑战，需要更丰富的多模态信息来提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RDTTrack跟踪器，利用预训练的RGB跟踪模型和提示学习技术，通过正交投影约束融合热红外和深度模态，然后将其与RGB信号整合作为提示输入基础跟踪模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂场景中的跟踪精度和鲁棒性显著优于现有的双模态方法。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪能够有效利用互补信息，在复杂场景中提供更鲁棒的跟踪性能，为多模态跟踪研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，统一了通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter，用于极端3D高斯溅射压缩，可实现超过100倍的压缩比同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射压缩方法要么依赖昂贵的优化过程，要么采用无训练的剪枝和量化，在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。需要一种能克服这种权衡的数据驱动方法。

Method: ExGS框架包含两个核心组件：UGC执行无重优化的剪枝来减少高斯基元，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化来从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。

Result: 该框架可实现超过100倍的压缩（从354.77 MB压缩到约3.31 MB），同时保持保真度，并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Motivation: 解决大型视频语言模型在长视频理解中面临的时空感知冲突问题，即均匀帧采样机制无法同时兼顾时间线索和空间细节，导致次优解。

Method: 提出自适应缩放机制：先提供小分辨率密集采样帧，当需要空间细节时，模型可以基于推理放大感兴趣的视频片段；采用多步推理过程，通过38k高质量CoT数据微调，并使用解耦强化微调优化内部缩放能力。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1比基线Qwen2.5-VL平均提升3.1%，慢-快自适应帧采样机制在采样密度和帧分辨率之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 自适应缩放机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时空感知冲突，多步推理和解耦强化微调显著提升了模型的缩放推理能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究发现多模态大语言模型中的视觉相关功能解码分布在不同解码层，每个视觉功能集中在特定2-3层（视觉功能层VFL），且不同VFL的深度顺序在不同模型中呈现一致模式，与人类认知行为相符。基于此提出了Visual Token Swapping分析框架和VFL-LoRA、VFL-select等应用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态大语言模型中视觉相关功能在不同解码层的分布规律，探索模型内部视觉处理的机制，为开发更高效、可解释和鲁棒的模型提供理论基础。

Method: 提出了Visual Token Swapping分析框架，通过修改特定的KV缓存条目来精确阐明解码过程中的层特定功能。基于VFL发现，开发了VFL-LoRA（选择性训练与训练数据功能对齐的VFL）和VFL-select（通过分析特定VFL消融后的性能差异自动按功能分类数据）。

Result: 发现每个视觉功能（如计数、定位、OCR识别）集中在特定2-3个VFL层，且不同VFL的深度顺序在不同MLLMs中呈现一致模式（如识别先于计数，计数先于定位）。VFL-LoRA优于全LoRA训练且防止域外功能遗忘。VFL-select仅用20%数据即可达到98%全数据性能，在数据选择上超越人类专家。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，揭示了视觉功能在解码层中的分布规律，提出的VFL-LoRA和VFL-select方法为构建更高效、可解释和鲁棒的多模态模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter是一个模块化框架，通过适配冻结的文本到图像扩散模型来实现反事实图像生成，能够对目标属性进行因果干预并保持图像核心身份不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而没有明确的因果结构，无法精确控制属性修改并保持图像身份。需要一种能够进行因果干预并保持图像核心身份的方法。

Method: 使用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入（将因果属性与文本嵌入对齐以实现精确语义控制）和条件令牌对比损失（解耦属性因子并减少虚假相关性）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，在Pendulum数据集上MAE减少91%，在ADNI数据集上FID减少87%，实现了高保真MRI图像生成。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合拓扑数据分析和图像过滤技术的3D物体分类方法TACO-Net，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，并对噪声输入具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D物体分类在计算机视觉、机器人和自动驾驶等领域具有重要应用价值，但由于点云的无序性、不规则性和噪声，实现高精度分类仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将点云转换为体素化二进制3D图像，提取区分性拓扑特征，然后使用轻量级一维卷积神经网络进行训练。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ModelNet10数据集上分别达到99.05%和99.52%的准确率，在真实世界OmniObject3D数据集上表现稳健，对10种不同类型的损坏输入具有强弹性。

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑数据分析与图像过滤技术，为3D物体分类提供了新的SOTA解决方案，具有高精度和强鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极度不受约束的野外2D照片重建高保真3D穿衣人像，支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要"干净"的输入（如全身图像、最小遮挡或良好校准的跨视角捕捉），而UP2You旨在直接处理原始、非结构化的照片，这些照片可能在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面差异很大。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效地将不受约束的输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；提出姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA），选择性融合多参考图像信息；使用感知器基础的多参考形状预测器，无需预捕获的身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕捉数据集上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%、P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%、LPIPS-46%）方面均优于先前方法，效率高（1.5分钟/人）。

Conclusion: UP2You高效、多功能，适用于人类被随意捕捉的真实世界场景，为这一未充分探索的任务的未来研究提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的视觉语言模型token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感性，选择互补的视觉token，显著提升推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在冗余视觉token导致推理成本高的问题，现有剪枝方法要么依赖不稳定的注意力分数，要么基于多样性选择但可能丢失关键区域

Method: 使用零阶扰动在投影层估计token敏感性，通过轻量前向传播衡量小随机扰动对投影输出的影响，选择高敏感性且互补的视觉token

Result: 在多个VLMs和基准测试中表现优异，能剪枝高达94.4%的token，保持准确性的同时显著提升效率，端到端推理速度提升达2.30倍

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需训练的token剪枝解决方案，通过敏感性估计和互补性选择平衡了准确性和效率

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

<details>

Motivation: 现有rPPG方法在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，且大多缺乏理论依据，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 从Navier-Stokes方程推导rPPG物理模型，设计PHASE-Net包含：零FLOPs轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控时序卷积网络。

Result: PHASE-Net在实验中达到最先进性能，同时保持高效率，提供理论支撑且易于部署的rPPG解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于物理原理的rPPG方法能显著提升性能，PHASE-Net为rPPG测量提供了理论依据和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

TL;DR: 提出ELPG-DTFS模型，一种先验引导的自适应时频图神经网络，用于基于EEG的抑郁症诊断，在MODMA数据集上达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症的及时客观筛查至关重要，但现有诊断依赖主观量表。EEG提供低成本生物标志物，但现有深度模型将频谱视为静态图像、固定通道间图结构并忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出ELPG-DTFS模型，包含：(1) 带跨频带互信息的通道-频带注意力机制；(2) 可学习邻接矩阵用于动态功能连接；(3) 残差知识图谱路径注入神经科学先验。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越2025年最先进的ACM-GNN。消融实验显示移除任何模块会使F1降低多达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于EEG的下一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制启发，旨在开发能够提升语义分割模型在恶劣条件下鲁棒性的预处理方法。

Method: 在RGB、灰度和对立颜色通道上应用Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)滤波来增强局部对比度，这种预处理是模型无关且轻量级的。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持分布内性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种模型无关的轻量级预处理方法有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在实时流式场景中因历史视觉特征存储限制和时空推理不足而效果有限的问题。

Method: 提出持久事件记忆森林机制，基于时间距离、内容相似性和合并频率的惩罚函数自适应组织视频帧为事件级树结构；引入细粒度时空窗口捕获短期视觉线索；创建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%；在极端视觉token压缩（1024个token）下仍能保持默认设置96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流式视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、高效性和泛化能力，为实时视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用时面临环境上下文有限、数据缺失或损坏、以及难以可靠反映用户意图等显著限制，需要改进以更好地利用多模态公开数据集。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件化能够提高卫星图像基础模型的性能，该模型在下游任务中具有应用潜力，同时构建了首个结合三种不同媒介数据的公开可用多模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步校准的RGB-热成像图像对稀缺，阻碍了视觉-热成像传感器融合和跨模态任务的发展，需要从丰富的RGB数据集中合成热成像图像用于训练。

Method: 提出自适应基于流的生成模型ThermalGen，包含RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，并构建了8个公共数据集和3个新的大规模卫星-航空RGB-T数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中，ThermalGen实现了与现有GAN和扩散方法相当或更优的翻译性能，能够合成反映视角、传感器特性和环境条件显著变化的热成像图像。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成反映多种变化因素的热成像图像的RGB-T图像翻译模型，为跨模态任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Result: 实验显示中毒输出可能比干净对应物具有更高的视觉质量，挑战了中毒必然降低保真度的假设。潜在空间中毒可以保持甚至增强输出美学。

Conclusion: 精心优化的扰动可以在生成器输出中产生一致、隐蔽的效果，同时保持视觉不显眼，这对图像生成管道的完整性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS是一个增强3D高斯溅射的稀疏视图合成框架，通过深度估计、虚拟视图生成和遮挡区域修复来解决稀疏输入下的几何失真和结构不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的新视角合成存在过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整的问题，3D高斯溅射在稀疏输入下会产生漂浮伪影和结构不一致。

Method: 提出混合损失深度估计模块、双向变形虚拟视图合成方法和遮挡感知重建组件，整合结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全。

Result: 在LLFF、Blender和DTU基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，PSNR最高达21.13 dB，LPIPS为0.189，保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过集成多视图一致性约束和遮挡区域恢复，显著提升了稀疏视图下的3D高斯溅射性能，实现了高质量的实时新视角合成。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出DAM框架，通过整合视觉-语言模型的多模态监督来补充稀疏的人工标注，在源自由主动域适应中实现双向知识蒸馏，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将ViL模型和数据监督视为独立来源而缺乏有效融合的问题，旨在利用多模态监督来增强稀疏人工标注的效果。

Method: 提出DAM框架，初始化稳定的ViL引导目标，采用双向蒸馏机制在迭代适应过程中促进目标模型与双重监督之间的知识交换。

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中，DAM始终优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DAM框架通过有效融合多模态监督和人类标注，在源自由主动域适应任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估的深度学习框架，能够同时预测椎体上下终板角度和坐标，通过SVD分析椎体形态直接计算角度，无需预设曲线模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间差异，现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法处理临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取，使用SVD从椎体形态直接分析角度预测。

Result: 在630张全脊柱前后位X光片上达到83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55°的平均绝对误差，在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 引入的椎体楔形指数(VWI)与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Attention Surgery框架，将预训练视频扩散模型中的注意力机制线性化或混合化，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力机制的二阶计算成本限制了长序列和高分辨率视频的生成效率。现有线性注意力方法无法在不重新训练的情况下达到softmax注意力的表达能力。

Method: 结合软注意力和线性注意力的混合注意力机制，配合轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，以及成本感知的块率策略来平衡表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用，注意力计算成本降低高达40%（FLOPs），在VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量。

Conclusion: 首次实现了具有竞争力的次二阶注意力视频扩散模型，为高效视频生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏系统结构和真实应用挑战，限制了统一多模态模型的性能发展。

Method: 结合分层任务分类法和自动化数据生成，利用结构化资源池和GPT-4o构建包含80k高质量指令-图像对的数据集，涵盖11个主要领域和51个子任务。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升，编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon on GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SID是一种目标导向的语言引导导航学习方法，通过自我改进的演示来增强智能体的探索能力，在未知环境中无需逐步指令即可导航到指定目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体，导致在未知环境中的探索能力不足。

Method: SID首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹。这些轨迹提供更强的探索策略演示来训练更好的智能体，形成迭代自我改进的管道。

Result: SID显著提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性能，在REVERIE和SOON等目标导向语言导航任务中实现了新的最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%的成功率，比之前领先方法高出13.9%。

Conclusion: 迭代自我改进管道能够扩展到新环境，产生的演示可以跨各种语言引导导航任务迁移，提升了目标导向导航任务的性能上限。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器或回归器，对于结构特定干预（如改变左肺面积）效果不足，会产生全局不良影响，且需要用户提供繁琐的分割标签。

Method: 提出Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT)，在标量值结构特定变量上进行干预，同时生成局部一致的反事实图像。

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法能够有效生成局部一致的反事实图像，无需用户提供繁琐的分割标签，在医学图像分析中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络（GANs）的可扩展性原则，借鉴其他生成模型在可扩展性方面的成功经验。

Method: 在紧凑的VAE潜在空间中训练，采用纯transformer生成器和判别器，并针对扩展问题提出轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整。

Result: GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96的FID分数，仅需40个epoch，比强基线少6倍训练轮次。

Conclusion: 通过潜在空间训练和transformer架构，GANs可以实现可靠的可扩展性，并在大规模生成任务中达到SOTA性能。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和稀疏任务相关信息的特点，现有LLM方法在捕获任务关键信息时难以同时保证完整性和效率。

Method: 采用MGPA模拟人类视觉分散和集中注意力来捕获任务相关信息，VERA验证感知的关键线索以减少幻觉并优化后续感知策略，通过交互过程探索最小化但信息丰富的任务相关线索。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上的实验显示，CogniGPT在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，在EgoSchema上仅用11.2帧就超越现有无训练方法，性能与Gemini 1.5-Pro相当。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进视觉认知的交互框架，有效解决了长视频理解中信息捕获的完整性和效率问题。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Motivation: 在医学影像等高风险领域，深度学习模型的精确置信度估计至关重要，过度自信的误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 开发定制CNN并在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟真实世界不确定性，使用温度缩放进行后处理校准。

Result: 温度缩放在所有噪声条件下都显著降低了ECE和NLL，同时保持了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 温度缩放是增强医学AI系统决策置信度的有效且计算高效的方法，使模型输出在噪声或不确定环境中更加可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略了场景中的人类，且缺乏标注的人-环境关系数据，同时现有方法通常只能从单帧图像中捕获开放词汇关系，限制了建模超出观察内容的长期交互能力。

Method: 引入Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类及其属性、活动与环境的关系，包括局部和远程关系，并创建了包含合成环境和全面人-场景关系标注的新基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法提高了人类活动预测能力，并改善了人-环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建具有社会智能的机器人铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光照和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且事件数据空间信息有限，缺乏标注数据集

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力整合RGB数据指导特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习从无标签事件数据中学习特征

Result: 在真实E-SIE数据集和合成WFLW-V基准测试中，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了事件数据空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏的问题，实现了优越的面部关键点对齐性能

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑胶质瘤治疗前后扫描的鲁棒分割对于肿瘤监测和治疗规划很重要，但训练通用模型需要大量高质量标注数据，而这类数据往往有限。数据增强可以缓解这个问题，但存储大量增强的3D数据计算成本高。

Method: 基于nnU-Net框架，提出在线数据增强策略，在训练过程中动态使用预训练的GliGANs插入合成肿瘤。评估了三种模型及其集成：无外部增强的基线模型、常规在线增强模型和定制在线增强模型。

Result: 在BraTS 2025在线验证平台上，三种模型的集成取得了以下病变级Dice分数：ET 0.79、NETC 0.749、RC 0.872、SNFH 0.825、TC 0.79、WT 0.88。

Conclusion: 该方法在BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1-成人胶质瘤分割中排名第一，证明了在线数据增强策略在脑胶质瘤分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This
work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Wan-Alpha框架，通过联合学习RGB和alpha通道来生成透明视频，使用变分自编码器将alpha通道编码到RGB潜在空间，并构建高质量RGBA视频数据集训练扩散变换器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGBA视频生成方法往往忽视视觉质量，限制了实际应用。需要开发能够生成高质量透明视频的新方法。

Method: 设计有效的变分自编码器将alpha通道编码到RGB潜在空间，构建高质量RGBA视频数据集，训练扩散变换器模型。

Result: 相比最先进方法，在视觉质量、运动真实感和透明度渲染方面表现出优越性能，能够生成各种半透明物体、发光效果和头发丝等精细细节。

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha框架能够有效生成高质量的透明视频，在多个关键指标上优于现有方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

### [325] [SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980)
*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间中预测关键点热图来充分利用预训练扩散先验，在少量训练下达到与Sapiens相当的性能，并在跨域基准上创下新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供了丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法如Marigold和Lotus主要关注密集预测，而SDPose旨在充分利用扩散先验进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的图像潜在空间中预测关键点热图以保留原始生成先验；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射为关键点热图；3. 引入辅助RGB重建分支以防止过拟合并增强域外鲁棒性；4. 构建COCO-OOD数据集评估域偏移下的鲁棒性。

Result: 仅使用Sapiens在COCO上训练计划的五分之一，SDPose在COCO验证集上与Sapiens-1B/2B达到同等水平，在跨域基准HumanArt和COCO-OOD上创下新的最先进水平。同时展示了在可控生成任务中的零样本姿态标注能力。

Conclusion: SDPose成功展示了预训练扩散模型作为人体姿态估计强大骨干的潜力，通过保留生成先验和轻量级设计，在少量训练下实现了优异的性能和跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

*Yuyang Yin,HaoXiang Guo,Fangfu Liu,Mengyu Wang,Hanwen Liang,Eric Li,Yikai Wang,Xiaojie Jin,Yao Zhao,Yunchao Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X是一个用于高保真可控全景视频生成的新框架，支持多样化的相机轨迹，通过球面感知扩散Transformer架构解决了全景数据与视频扩散先验不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于窄视场角或相机可控性不足，无法生成连续完整的360度可探索视觉世界。

Method: 首先在Unreal Engine中模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径数据集，然后提出球面感知扩散Transformer架构，将等距柱面特征重投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高质量的可控全景视频。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

*Tooba Imtiaz,Lucy Chai,Kathryn Heal,Xuan Luo,Jungyeon Park,Jennifer Dy,John Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Local View Transformer (LVT)架构，通过局部注意力机制避免标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题，实现大规模场景重建和新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度限制了其在大规模3D场景重建中的应用，需要找到更高效的注意力机制来处理大规模场景。

Method: 使用局部邻域注意力机制，基于相对几何变换的位置编码，将场景解码为3D高斯泼溅表示，包含颜色和透明度视角依赖性。

Result: 能够单次前向传播重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景，解决了传统方法在大场景中的扩展性问题。

Conclusion: LVT通过局部视图处理和几何感知的位置编码，为大规模3D场景重建提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

TL;DR: CLASP是一个无需标注数据或微调的轻量级无监督图像分割框架，使用自监督ViT编码器提取特征，通过谱聚类和自适应参数选择实现分割，在COCO Stuff和ADE20K上达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大型未标注数据集（如数字广告和营销工作流中的品牌安全筛选、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核）提供易于复现的无监督分割基线方法。

Method: 使用自监督ViT（DINO）提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用全连接DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上取得了竞争性的mIoU和像素精度，与近期无监督基线方法性能相当。

Conclusion: CLASP的零训练设计使其成为大型未标注语料库的强大且易于复现的基线方法，特别适用于数字广告和营销工作流。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在自然图像领域展现出强大的推理能力，但其在地球观测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。地球观测任务面临独特挑战，需要任务感知的推理能力。

Method: 采用后训练框架，融入任务感知奖励机制，使基于推理的强化学习模型能够有效适应各种地球观测任务。

Result: 在多个地球观测基准测试中，相比最先进的通用和专业视觉语言模型，该方法都取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该训练策略增强了遥感图像的推理能力，稳定了优化过程，并提高了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

*Xiaoxiao Ma,Haibo Qiu,Guohui Zhang,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE是一个用于自回归图像生成的稳定强化学习框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励解决GRPO算法中的梯度冲突和策略熵不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO算法在自回归图像生成中存在训练不稳定问题，容易破坏预训练模型能力，导致收益有限、图像质量下降和泛化能力差。

Method: 提出STAGE框架：1）优势/KL重加权：相似性感知重加权缓解冲突更新；2）熵奖励：基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习过程。

Result: 实验表明STAGE在多个基准测试中持续改善视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化能力，相比基线GRPO表现更好。

Conclusion: STAGE通过缓解token间冲突和稳定训练过程，减少对预训练分布的破坏，改善泛化能力并更好地迁移到其他基准测试。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL是一个新颖的少样本学习框架，通过大语言模型和视觉-文本桥接技术，构建精确的跨模态提示，解决了传统方法中语义与视觉证据不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法在融合语义信息时容易产生与视觉证据矛盾的幻觉语义，导致噪声指导和昂贵的修正成本。

Method: 提出跨模态迭代提示(CIP)和跨模态几何对齐(CGA)。CIP基于类名和支持图像迭代生成精确的类描述，CGA通过最小化三维平行六面体的核化体积来对齐文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个不同的基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，包括标准、跨领域和细粒度少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化和一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline.
In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.
Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high
accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to
calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能与图像采集能力同步扩展，需要解决大规模图像配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出IO感知的非GEMM融合内核，结合分布式框架，优化非GEMM瓶颈，实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Conclusion: FFDP框架在大规模图像配准方面实现了前所未有的能力，显著提升了计算效率和内存利用率，能够处理比现有方法大得多的配准问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

TL;DR: GEM是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的冷冻电镜重建框架，在保持高效率的同时直接在实空间操作，相比现有方法实现了更快的训练速度、更低的内存使用和更高的分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模庞大（通常超过10万张粒子图像），传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销呈立方增长。

Method: GEM使用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质，每个高斯仅用11个参数化。设计了新颖的梯度计算来优化对每个体素有贡献的3D高斯，显著减少了内存占用和训练成本。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM实现了高达48%的训练加速和12%的内存使用降低，同时局部分辨率提升高达38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image

geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MANI-Pure对抗性净化框架，通过频率自适应噪声注入有效抑制高频脆弱区域的对抗扰动，同时保留低频语义内容，在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性净化方法依赖均匀噪声注入，会无差别扰动所有频率，破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动并非均匀分布，主要集中在高频区域，且不同频率和攻击类型具有异质性强度模式。

Method: MANI-Pure框架利用输入的幅度谱指导净化过程，自适应地应用异质性、频率定向的噪声，有效抑制脆弱高频低幅度频带中的对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验验证了MANI-Pure的有效性：将干净准确率差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒准确率提高2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒准确率，超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应噪声注入策略，在保持高干净准确率的同时显著提升对抗鲁棒性，为对抗性净化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文将分数蒸馏(SiD)方法扩展到预训练的文本到图像流匹配模型，证明分数蒸馏技术可以统一应用于扩散模型和流匹配模型，实现高效加速生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成质量高但采样速度慢，流匹配与扩散模型在理论上等价，但不确定蒸馏技术是否可以直接迁移到流匹配模型。

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导统一高斯扩散和流匹配，将分数身份蒸馏(SiD)扩展到预训练文本到图像流匹配模型。

Result: 实验表明SiD在多种流匹配模型上开箱即用，无需教师模型微调或架构更改，在数据自由和数据辅助设置下均有效。

Conclusion: 分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，统一了扩散和流基生成器的加速技术，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够从事件相机数据中高效构建表示的方法，利用事件数据的稀疏性，对噪声和事件率变化具有鲁棒性。

Method: 结合多分辨率哈希编码和深度集合思想，将事件表示为连续时空体积中的多通道图像，通过预测未来事件来学习表示。

Result: 在光学流估计、语义分割和单目度量深度估计等任务上获得最先进性能，支持120Hz HD和440Hz VGA分辨率处理，下游任务预测可达25-75Hz HD分辨率。

Conclusion: F³方法能够高效处理事件相机数据，在多种机器人平台、光照条件和环境下都表现出色，为事件相机的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可改善多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然有限。研究发现这是由于注意力机制中视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法在不同帧中一致识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 将稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达性质与Transformer中的注意力机制联系起来，提出VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索，将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升，例如在VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）上，使用InternVL2-8B和Qwen2.5VL-72B分别获得了3.2%和4.6%的改进。定性分析展示了更连贯的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过利用子空间亲和性有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理中的局限性，为改善视觉注意力机制提供了一种新颖的方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing方法解决流式视频生成中的错误累积问题，通过联合去噪、注意力池和高效训练算法，实现高质量、低延迟的长视频流生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重的错误累积问题，导致长时域视频质量显著下降，需要一种能够最小化错误累积的新技术。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧而非逐帧采样；2. 注意力池机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: Rolling Forcing能够在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频流，显著减少错误累积，提升视频质量。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing通过创新的联合去噪和注意力池设计，有效解决了流式视频生成中的错误累积问题，实现了高质量长视频流生成。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从零训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，可提供更好的语义表示

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1)冻结编码器，训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2)联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3)精炼解码器提升重建质量

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，标记器加速扩散模型收敛，64轮达到gFID 1.90；在LAION上，20亿参数文本到图像模型在相同训练步数下优于FLUX VAE

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

TL;DR: PICO是一个视觉上下文学习框架，利用扩散变换器实现个性化视觉任务，无需重新训练即可从单个标注示例推断并应用变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在个性化任务上表现不佳，现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据流水线，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出四面板框架PICO，构建多样化数据集VisRel，并引入注意力引导的种子评分器来提高推理可靠性。

Result: PICO在性能上超越了微调和合成数据基线，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非规模驱动鲁棒泛化，PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

TL;DR: 提出LayerCD方法，通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成与输入图像内容不一致的输出。研究发现浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低层信息，不足以支持高层推理

Method: LayerCD（层对比解码），通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征分别生成的输出分布来过滤幻觉

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上进行了广泛实验，LayerCD显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: LayerCD通过对比不同层次视觉特征生成的输出分布，有效解决了多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，同时保持目标物体不存在，从而发现模型特定的幻觉漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即模型会感知图像中不存在的物体。现有研究使用静态基准测试，无法发现模型特定或未预料的幻觉漏洞。

Method: GHOST方法在图像嵌入空间进行优化，误导模型同时保持目标物体不存在，然后引导扩散模型生成自然图像。生成的图像保持视觉自然性，但包含微妙的误导线索。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上，GHOST实现了超过28%的幻觉成功率，远高于之前数据驱动方法的约1%。为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o中诱导幻觉的成功率达66.5%。

Conclusion: GHOST既是诊断工具也是纠正工具，通过在其生成的图像上进行微调可以减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，无需从头训练，通过轻量级嵌入对齐和少量LoRA微调实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在高分辨率（如4K）生成时面临效率挑战，而现有研究很少处理潜在空间中的内在冗余问题。

Method: 采用后训练流程，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练弥合表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调来解锁基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证，DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上减少4K图像生成延迟53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后单张NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，总延迟减少138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够显著加速文本到图像扩散模型，同时保持与基础模型相当的质量，为高分辨率图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for

temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有重要潜力，结合生成先验和可微分渲染实现了高质量的可变形3D重建。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V通过潜在偏移和傅里叶引导解决图像到视频生成中的条件图像泄漏问题，在仅有1.3B参数的情况下超越了更大模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法存在条件图像泄漏问题，导致运动缓慢、颜色不一致等性能下降，并且在域外数据上表现不佳。

Method: 提出潜在偏移（从噪声潜在中减去条件图像信息）和傅里叶引导（使用傅里叶变换的高频特征加速收敛和细节调整）。

Result: 在Vbench-I2V上获得53.01的动态度分数，超越了CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P等更大模型。

Conclusion: FlashI2V有效克服了条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现了最佳泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

### [352] [Visual Jigsaw Post-Training Improves MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25190)
*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的视觉中心后训练框架，通过将视觉输入分割、打乱并要求模型用自然语言重建正确排列来增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练范式主要是文本中心的，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。需要开发视觉中心的后训练方法来增强模型对视觉信号的内在理解。

Method: 将视觉输入分割、打乱，模型需要生成正确的排列顺序作为自然语言输出。该方法与可验证奖励的强化学习对齐，无需额外视觉生成组件，自动获取监督信号。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上的实验显示，在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在多模态大语言模型后训练中具有巨大潜力，有望激发更多视觉中心预文本设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VGGT-X方法，解决了3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的内存消耗和输出质量问题，实现了无需COLMAP的密集视图合成和姿态估计的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和3DGS的新视角合成方法依赖SfM获取的准确3D属性，但SfM在低纹理或低重叠场景中速度慢且脆弱。3D基础模型虽然速度快，但在密集视图设置中存在内存负担大和输出不完善的问题。

Method: VGGT-X包含三个核心组件：内存高效的VGGT实现（可扩展到1000+图像）、用于增强VGGT输出的自适应全局对齐，以及鲁棒的3DGS训练实践。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管线的质量差距，在无需COLMAP的密集新视角合成和姿态估计中达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的应用提供了有效解决方案，并分析了与COLMAP初始化渲染的剩余差距，为未来3D基础模型和密集NVS的发展提供了见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

*Alessandra Urbinati,Mirko Lai,Simona Frenda,Marco Antonio Stranisci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的无监督方法来评估内容审核模型对弱势群体的偏见，使用保形预测技术计算模型置信度，发现某些预训练模型对少数群体标注的预测准确率高但置信度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在内容审核中存在种族和社会偏见问题，虽然已有基准语料库，但公平性测量仍是一个开放问题。需要评估模型对弱势群体标注的不确定性来揭示偏见。

Method: 使用保形预测技术计算模型不确定性作为偏见代理指标，评估11个模型对女性和非白人标注者的偏见程度，并与基于性能的F1分数进行比较。

Result: 结果显示某些预训练模型对少数群体标注的预测准确率高但置信度低，通过测量模型置信度可以识别哪些标注者群体在预训练模型中得到更好表示。

Conclusion: 通过测量模型置信度能够揭示预训练模型对不同群体的表示偏差，为模型去偏过程提供指导，确保在正式使用前进行有效的去偏处理。

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media.
Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task,
but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if
several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this
issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open
issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models
on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people
belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the
conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models
against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges
from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show
that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from
minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore,
by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of
annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing
process of these models before their effective use.

TL;DR: AccessEval基准评估了21个闭源和开源LLM在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型中的表现，发现对残疾相关查询的回应更负面、刻板印象更强、事实错误更多，反映了模型行为中根深蒂固的残疾歧视。


<details>

Motivation: 系统调查LLM在不同残疾情境下处理现实生活查询的差异，揭示模型偏见如何转化为对残疾用户的实际伤害。

Method: 使用配对的普通查询和残疾相关查询，在6个现实世界领域和9种残疾类型上评估21个LLM，采用情感、社会认知和事实准确性指标分析模型输出。

Result: 对残疾相关查询的回应通常语气更负面、刻板印象增加、事实错误率更高，这些影响因领域和残疾类型而异，听力、言语和行动障碍受影响尤为严重。

Conclusion: 模型行为中存在的残疾歧视偏见可能在日常应用中造成实际伤害，强调了在技术评估和用户影响之间建立联系的重要性，以及减轻偏见的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains
but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To
systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we
introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark
evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9
disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We
evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and
factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have
a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared
to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and
disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility
disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of
ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we
better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for
disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation
and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day
applications. Our dataset is publicly available at:

*Kaishuai Xu,Wenjun Hou,Yi Cheng,Wenjie Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAR²框架，通过联合学习改进推理增强检索和检索增强推理，解决复杂医学问题中RAG方法推理能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理需要深度推理的复杂医学问题时表现不佳，因为表层输入无法反映任务的真实知识需求，且缺乏对推理过程的显式建模。

Method: 构建思维过程揭示隐含知识需求，指导检索和答案生成；使用混合偏好对数据集和DPO训练；设计两种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在多个生物医学问答数据集上实验证明，RAR²优于带或不带微调的RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: RAR²框架通过联合优化检索和推理过程，有效提升了处理复杂医学问题的能力，为医学LLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse
medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world
clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key
approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating
external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical
questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails
to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically
focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process,
limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge.
In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both
Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$
constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and
uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset
of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to
train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to
explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets,
outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

*Jiho Park,Jongyoon Song,Minjin Choi,Kyuho Heo,Taehun Huh,Ji Won Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRUEBench是一个专门为LLM生产力助手设计的新基准测试，通过12种语言输入、隐式约束和多轮对话等真实场景，对LLM的指令遵循能力进行更严格的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM真实世界指令遵循能力方面存在不足，包括缺乏多语言性、未能捕捉用户请求中的隐式约束，以及忽视多轮对话的复杂性。

Method: 引入TRUEBench基准测试，特征包括：12种语言的输入提示、实例内多语言指令、捕捉显式和隐式约束的严格评估标准、具有累积约束和上下文切换的复杂多轮对话场景，并使用LLM验证器精炼约束以确保评估可靠性。

Result: 广泛实验表明TRUEBench比现有基准测试更具挑战性，即使是像OpenAI o1这样的强模型也仅达到69.07%的总体通过率。

Conclusion: TRUEBench为LLM在实际生产力场景中提供了严格且真实的评估，突出了它们的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity
assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their
real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i)
lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints
inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn
dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic
assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation
Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity
assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12
languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing
rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints,
and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating
constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in
evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater
challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI
o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and
realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting
their capabilities and limitations.

*Sadia Abdulhalim,Muaz Albaghdadi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态注意力融合(DAF)框架，结合文本和语音特征进行情感分析，无需微调预训练模型即可在基准测试中超越单模态和静态融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态情感分析仅依赖文本，忽略了语音语调等非语言线索，无法准确捕捉真实情感意图。

Method: 使用冻结的预训练语言模型文本嵌入和语音编码器特征，通过自适应注意力机制为每个话语动态加权不同模态。

Result: 在大型多模态基准测试中，DAF模型在F1分数上显著提升，预测误差降低，消融研究证实动态加权策略对建模复杂情感输入至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合语言和非语言信息，该方法为情感预测提供了更稳健的基础，对情感计算应用具有广泛影响。

Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely
on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody
that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic
Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text
embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a
speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality
per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed
DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on
a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and
reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that
support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for
modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and
non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for
sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing
applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more
natural human computer interaction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种在扩散语言模型中近似联合采样的方法，通过轻量级采样器层在单次前向传播中生成多个token，平衡生成速度与分布准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散语言模型并行生成多个token时会偏离真实联合分布，导致准确性下降。需要一种方法在保持生成速度的同时近似联合采样。

Method: 在现有大型扩散LM上添加轻量级单层采样器，训练该采样器模拟冻结主模型的精确联合采样，实现单次主模型前向传播后通过多次采样器前向传播生成多个token。

Result: 在4个token并行去噪时，MAUVE得分达到0.87（相比边际基线0.31），在语言建模和数学编程任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了扩散语言模型中的近似联合采样，在保持生成速度的同时显著提升了生成文本的分布准确性。

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on
all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked
diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and
potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct
underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking
in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the
further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the
resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a
way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution
in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight
single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward
pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only
this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained
to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the
effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only
(Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language
modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each
full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of
0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint
distribution.

*Sasha Cui,Zhongren Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了无痛激活引导（PAS），一种完全自动化的激活引导方法，无需手动构建提示对或特征标注，就能利用任何标注数据集进行语言模型行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的权重后训练方法耗时昂贵，提示引导方法不够精确且需要手动试错，而当前激活引导技术需要手工构建提示对或特征标注，使用不便。

Method: PAS通过自动化的方式构建激活向量，无需提示构建、特征标注或人工干预，可以直接使用任何给定的标注数据集。

Result: 在三个开源模型和18个任务上的评估显示，PAS能可靠提升行为任务性能，但对智能导向任务无效。内省变体iPAS在偏见、道德和对齐任务上分别提升10.1%、5.2%和34.8%。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种快速、轻量级的激活向量构建方法，可以作为实用的自动化语言模型后训练选项，并明确了激活引导适用的场景和局限性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and
behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is
time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and
often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises
a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training
methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or
labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the
plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of
fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled
dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human
intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models
(Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks;
we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for
intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the
strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8%
on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context
Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector
that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results
provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy
it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MIRAGE基准，用于评估多跳问答中的歧义处理能力，并开发了CLARION多智能体框架来解决这一挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多跳问答往往涉及与推理过程本身不可分割的歧义性，这带来了独特的挑战，因为单个问题可能产生多个推理路径，每个子问题都需要独立解决歧义。

Method: 提出了MIRAGE基准，包含1,142个高质量的多跳歧义问题，涵盖句法、一般和语义歧义分类，并通过多LLM验证流程进行严格筛选。同时开发了CLARION多智能体框架来处理歧义。

Result: 实验表明，即使是当前最先进的模型在MIRAGE基准上也表现不佳，证实了结合歧义解决和多步推理是一个独特且显著的挑战。CLARION框架显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多跳推理中的歧义处理是一个重要挑战，CLARION框架为开发更自适应和鲁棒的推理系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is
inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a
distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single
question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is
ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a
single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the
reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in
this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing
incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce
MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE),
a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of
ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142
high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a
taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a
rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even
state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity
combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To
establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning
and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly
outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and
robust reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 虽然FishSpeech表现最佳，但仅依赖单一TTS模型构建数据集可能会限制泛化能力。

Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between
real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that
have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have
focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects.
In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech
dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model
and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide
the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple
models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation
pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern
embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine
learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The
pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on
human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets
through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate.
Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic
voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and
challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for
dataset creation may limit generalizability.

*Kai Zhang,Christopher Malon,Lichao Sun,Martin Renqiang Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EditGRPO是一种混合策略强化学习算法，通过临床动机奖励优化放射学报告生成，在四个主要胸部X光报告数据集上平均提升3.4%的性能指标，并在未见数据集上表现出5.9%的优越泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成中虽然性能有所提升，但其监督微调目标并未明确与临床效果对齐，需要设计专门优化临床效能的训练方法。

Method: 提出EditGRPO混合策略强化学习算法，结合在线策略探索和离线策略指导，在训练过程中注入句子级详细修正，解决RL中的探索困境和采样效率问题。

Result: 在基于Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM的实验中，EditGRPO超越了监督微调和普通GRPO基线，在CheXbert、GREEN、Radgraph和RATEScore四个指标上平均提升3.4%，在未见数据集上平均提升5.9%。

Conclusion: EditGRPO通过临床动机奖励和混合策略强化学习有效提升了放射学报告生成的临床效能和泛化能力，为解决医学图像分析中的文本生成问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis,
effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent
innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown
improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not
explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO,
a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to
optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO
integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting
sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy
approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues
typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO
baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN,
Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation
datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain
generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

*Chi Ruan,Dongfu Jiang,Yubo Wang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL)方法，通过让模型对(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，仅基于最终判断标签是否与真实标签一致来给予奖励。基于此开发了Critique-Coder模型，在标准RL数据中替换20%为CRL数据进行混合训练，在代码生成和逻辑推理任务上均优于仅使用RL的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习主要关注生成响应，缺乏显式培养批判或反思的机制。受CFT和CGD等研究的启发，需要开发能够显式教导LLMs如何进行批判的方法。

Method: 提出CRL方法，模型任务是为给定的(问题，解决方案)对生成批判，奖励仅基于生成的批判的最终判断标签是否与真实判断标签一致。在此基础上开发Critique-Coder模型，使用RL和CRL的混合数据进行训练(用20%的CRL数据替换标准RL数据)。

Result: Critique-Coder在所有评估基准上持续优于仅使用RL的基线模型。Critique-Coder-8B在LiveCodeBench(v5)上达到超过60%，优于DeepCoder-14B和GPT-o1等推理模型。在BBEH数据集的逻辑推理任务上也表现更好，表明CRL在编码数据集上的应用增强了通用推理和批判能力。

Conclusion: CRL作为标准RL的很好补充，能够增强LLM的推理能力。在编码数据集上应用CRL可以提升通用推理和批判能力，这些能力可迁移到广泛的任务中。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm,
particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily
focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster
critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT)
and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly
teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique
Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a
critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely
by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$
of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building
on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a
hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL
data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them
on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show
that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all
the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach
over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like
DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also
demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better
performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that
the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and
critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks.
Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM
reasoning.

*Hwan Chang,Yonghyun Jun,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatInject是一种新型的间接提示注入攻击，通过模仿聊天模板格式和多轮对话说服技术，显著提高了攻击成功率，现有防御措施对此类攻击效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体与外部环境交互增多，出现了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注纯文本注入攻击，但LLM对结构化聊天模板的依赖及其在上下文操纵中的脆弱性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ChatInject攻击方法，将恶意载荷格式化为原生聊天模板样式，并开发了基于说服的多轮对话变体，通过多轮对话引导智能体接受可疑操作。

Result: 在多个前沿LLM上的实验显示：ChatInject平均攻击成功率显著高于传统方法（AgentDojo从5.18%提升至32.05%，InjecAgent从15.13%提升至45.90%），多轮对话在InjecAgent上达到52.33%成功率；聊天模板载荷具有强跨模型迁移性；现有防御措施对此类攻击基本无效。

Conclusion: 当前智能体系统存在严重漏洞，ChatInject攻击暴露了LLM在结构化模板和多轮对话上下文中的安全脆弱性，需要新的防御机制来应对此类威胁。

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that
interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for
adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where
attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing
agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While
previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we
find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on
structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation
through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject,
an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates,
thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies.
Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant
that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute
otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier
LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves
significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt
injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13%
to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong
performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2)
chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models
and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown
template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely
ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn
variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

*Kai Hua,Zhiyuan Feng,Chongyang Tao,Rui Yan,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RSM-DCK模型，通过检测上下文和知识库中的相关部分来改进多轮对话响应选择，解决无用信息干扰问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索式对话系统将所有上下文和知识内容用于匹配响应候选，但其中许多无用信息会影响匹配效果，需要检测相关部分

Method: 使用最近上下文作为查询，在词级和话语级语义上预选相关上下文和知识，然后分别与响应候选交互，最后融合表示再次选择相关知识

Result: 在两个基准数据集上测试，模型性能优于现有方法，能有效检测相关上下文和知识

Conclusion: RSM-DCK模型通过检测相关上下文和知识部分，显著提升了多轮对话响应选择的性能

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great
attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems
have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching
model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the
response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different
parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing
the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic
shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can
influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address
this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election
\textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the
\textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our
model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of
the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level
semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context
and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of
the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant
parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our
proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our
model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can
effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

*Jiaqian Li,Yanshu Li,Ligong Han,Ruixiang Tang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出In-Context Routing (ICR)方法，在注意力对数级别内化可泛化的ICL模式，实现一次性训练可重复使用的隐式上下文学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式上下文学习方法主要依赖注入偏移向量，这些向量通常从标记演示或任务特定对齐构建，未能充分利用ICL的结构机制且泛化能力有限。

Method: ICR提取ICL过程中出现的可重用结构方向，并采用可学习的输入条件路由器来相应调节注意力对数，实现一次性训练可重复使用的框架。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ICR始终优于需要任务特定检索或训练的先前隐式ICL方法，并在现有方法难以处理的域外任务上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ICR能够推动ICL实用价值的边界，为隐式上下文学习提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm
that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language
Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost.
However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into
residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or
task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural
mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address
this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that
internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It
extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a
learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly,
enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world
datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR
consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific
retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to
out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position
ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对45个大语言模型进行了大规模认知偏见评估，分析了280万条响应，发现LLMs在17.8-57.3%的情况下表现出与人类相似的认知偏见行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地嵌入现实世界决策过程，有必要系统评估它们是否表现出人类常见的认知偏见，这对确保AI决策的公正性至关重要。

Method: 开发了基于选择题的新型评估框架，与心理学家合作手工策划了220个决策场景数据集，通过控制提示变体生成多样化提示，评估了8种经典认知偏见。

Result: LLMs在锚定、可得性、确认、框架、解释、过度归因、前景理论和代表性等偏见中表现出偏见一致性行为。模型规模和提示详细程度显著影响偏见易感性：更大模型（>32B参数）在39.5%情况下减少偏见，更详细提示最多减少14.9%偏见（除过度归因偏见增加8.8%外）。

Conclusion: 大语言模型确实表现出系统性的认知偏见，模型规模和提示设计是影响偏见程度的重要因素，这对开发更可靠的AI决策系统具有重要启示。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world
decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which
they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology,
cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human
judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight
well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million
LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this,
we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks,
hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive
biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for
generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis
shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances
across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring,
availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect
theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt
specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger
size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt
detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case
(Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络和transformer的混合方法，结合词典特征来预测阿拉伯语文档可读性，在文档级别融合两种方法的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更准确的阿拉伯语文档可读性预测系统，通过结合图结构和上下文表示来提升预测性能。

Method: 将文档建模为句子级图，节点包含句子和词元，边捕获词汇共现和类别关系。使用GNN和transformer两个独立分支，通过后期融合结合预测结果，文档级预测采用最大池化聚合句子级输出。

Result: 混合方法在多个可读性指标上优于单独的GNN或transformer分支，融合在文档级别具有优势，但GNN单独方法在句子级可读性预测上更精确。

Conclusion: 融合方法在文档级可读性预测中表现更好，而GNN方法在句子级预测上更精确，展示了不同方法在不同粒度任务中的优势。

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict
document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained
Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a
sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges
capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class
membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as
well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph
neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two
independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at
inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated
using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results
show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches
across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that
fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach
remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

TL;DR: HEART框架通过情感驱动提示进行迭代自我修正，利用基于六种基本情感的情感反馈来改进语言模型的推理能力，在验证器指导下能显著提升推理深度和准确性，但在无验证器设置中效果不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理学研究启发，当前的自反思策略主要关注逻辑或结构优化，未能利用情感反馈的引导潜力。研究表明情绪可以调节认知表现，因此探索情感反馈对语言模型推理能力的影响。

Method: HEART框架使用基于Paul Ekman六种基本情感的情感驱动提示进行迭代自我修正。通过系统变化反馈的情感语调，引导模型逃离错误推理路径并探索更有希望的替代方案。

Result: 在OlympiadBench、Humanity's Last Exam和SimpleQA等挑战性推理基准上，当有oracle验证器指导时，情感迭代协议能解锁更深层推理，准确率相比最先进基线有显著提升。但在无验证器设置中难以稳定利用这些增益。

Conclusion: 机器推理的下一个前沿不仅在于精炼逻辑，还在于理解和利用模型的'内心'（情感方面）。情感反馈是提升推理能力的重要方向，但需要解决无验证器环境下的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance
of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning.
However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical
or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of
affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions
can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that
uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides
feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise,
emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by
Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback
across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths
and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on
challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam,
and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by
an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly
deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy
over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also
identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free
setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a
key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in
machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding
and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Motivation: 现有聊天机器人和基于LLM的社交代理通常不集成心理理论，而人类社交智能的关键方面就是理解他人的心理状态。

Method: 引入ToMAgent(ToMA)，通过将心理理论与对话前瞻配对，生成对实现对话目标最有用的心理状态。

Result: 在Sotopia交互式社交评估基准上的实验表明，该方法优于多种基线方法，表现出更具战略性、目标导向的推理行为。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明在构建社交智能LLM代理方面，集成心理理论向前迈进了一步。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key
aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents
do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that
explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively.
After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between
dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce
ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM
with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for
achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social
evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range
of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic,
goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while
maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a
step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model
specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves
performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude
larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised
fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of
0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming
GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology
employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces
280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by
parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M
out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel
semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity
in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific
optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while
requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在三个药物基准测试中的表现：药物名称与剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别和药物订单生成，发现模型在所有测试中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在医疗诊断中有应用潜力，但对其在推荐适当药物方案方面的一致性评估较少，需要验证其在药物相关任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o完成三个实验：药物-剂型匹配、药物相互作用识别（使用内部知识和网络搜索）、药物订单生成。通过余弦相似度、Levenshtein相似度、ROUGE指标和临床医生手动评估来量化准确性。

Result: GPT-4o在药物-剂型匹配中表现差，49%的药物正确匹配所有可用剂型；药物相互作用识别中网络搜索比内部知识表现稍好（69.2% vs 54.7%），但无相互作用时表现更差；药物订单生成中65.8%无错误。

Conclusion: 模型在所有测试中表现总体不佳，凸显需要通过临床医生标注的数据集进行领域特定训练，并建立全面的评估框架来基准测试性能。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical
conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending
appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test
GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to
its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its
internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order
sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three
experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine
similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and
ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual
evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation
matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per
medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per
medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all
available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more
formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying
drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the
search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs.
69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there
was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally,
GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with
only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or
abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all
tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through
clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for
benchmarking performance.

Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content
from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for
storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally
expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene
illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a
scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we
consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image
models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply
variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize
illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task
to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of
this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new
resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our
analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we
demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly
evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and
evaluating illustrations.

### [376] [What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22947)
*Mohammed Sabry,Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在等计算量条件下，通过注入前向复制（Induction）、后向复制（Anti）或混合数据来显式训练归纳电路，发现虽然能加速小模型归纳头的出现，但并不能持续改善上下文学习性能。自然文本训练的模型在标准基准测试中表现最佳，且发展出更集中、负载更重的电路结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在预训练中显式训练归纳电路是否能改善上下文学习，还是自然文本在等计算量条件下已经足够。测试目标合成数据是否能加速归纳头出现并增强上下文学习能力。

Method: 引入Bi-Induct轻量级课程，在预训练流中注入前向复制、后向复制或平衡混合数据。在等FLOPs条件下训练0.13B到1B参数模型，评估少样本上下文学习基准、头级遥测和语言建模困惑度。

Result: Bi-Induct在小规模加速归纳头出现，但未能持续改善泛化能力。在标准LM基准上，Bi-Induct与纯自然训练相当；在函数式上下文学习探测中，1B纯自然模型表现最佳。自然模型发展出更早、更广泛的归纳头，且电路更集中、负载更重。

Conclusion: 诱导激活不足以保证上下文学习增益，关键在于这些电路是否变得功能必要。结果强调需要机制感知的预训练诊断和数据混合，以培养负载承载而非仅仅存在的结构。

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve
in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held
constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate
induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight
curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a
balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B
parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii)
head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our
findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation
directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at
small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On
standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on
function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests
(e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these
trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier
induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails
to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data
shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns
with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades
ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating
more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more
redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall,
inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits
becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware
pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely
present, structure.

*Jon Gauthier,Canaan Breiss,Matthew Leonard,Edward F. Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现自监督语音模型在表示英语名词和动词屈折变化时，展现了一种全局线性几何结构，这种结构追踪的是词汇间的分布关系而非直接的语言学单元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解自监督语音模型在噪声环境中识别口语单词时所使用的语言学表示类型，特别是对语音学和形态学现象的表征方式。

Method: 研究针对单词识别优化的S3M变体模型，分析它们如何表示常见英语名词和动词屈折变化中的语音学和形态学现象。

Result: 模型表示展现出全局线性几何结构，可用于连接英语名词和动词与其规则屈折形式，但这种结构不直接追踪语音或形态单元，而是追踪词汇间的分布关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现挑战了语音学和形态学需要独立语言表示的必要性假设，为支持人类口语单词识别的候选表征策略提供了线索。

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken
words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the
types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task.
To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word
recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent
English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a
global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to
their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or
morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional
relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not
always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate
representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition,
challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of
phonology and morphology.

*Yue Zhang,Seiji Maekawa,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过控制变量研究表格表示形式对问答性能的影响，发现不同方法在不同数据格式下各有优劣，没有单一方法在所有条件下都表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的表格问答需要同时处理结构化数据库和半结构化表格，但现有基准测试受限于固定数据格式，未能系统研究表示形式本身对模型性能的影响。

Method: 使用语言化管道生成配对的结枃化和半结构化表格，保持内容不变而改变结构，并引入包含表格大小、连接需求、查询复杂度和模式质量等维度的诊断基准。

Result: 实验显示SQL方法在结构化输入上准确率高但在半结构化数据上表现下降，LLMs具有灵活性但精度较低，混合方法在噪声模式条件下表现最佳。这些效应随表格增大和查询变复杂而加剧。

Conclusion: 表示形式在表格问答性能中起核心作用，没有单一方法在所有条件下都表现优异，研究结果为模型选择和设计提供了实用见解，为开发适应多样化现实世界数据格式的鲁棒混合方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over
both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields.
However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not
systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We
present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table
representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a
verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured
tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support
detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table
size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments
reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on
structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility
but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly
under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more
complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and
we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA
performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and
design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse
real-world data formats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传记推理是事实知识的关键维度但研究不足，需要系统评估LLM在此领域的能力，特别是解决幻觉问题。

Method: 构建覆盖400万人的多语言多模态数据集AdamDB，基于布鲁姆分类法设计认知结构评估AdamBench，并提出针对传记背景的检索增强生成系统AdamRAG。

Result: AdamRAG显著提升开源模型性能，对闭源模型也有适度改善，在低阶推理上效果最明显。流行度强烈影响准确性，人脸图像的多模态输入改进较小且不稳定。

Conclusion: ADAM建立了首个认知、文化和多模态基础的传记评估基准，推动了多语言、准确且抗幻觉的多模态大语言模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating
and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical
reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet
underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a
multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across
geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively
structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels
in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly
for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that
AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits
closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity
strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers
smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the
first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally
grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual,
accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with
large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for
comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis
was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of
topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing
human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human
corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown
Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in
Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic,
Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and
are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are
tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The
subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on
average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on
average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在长上下文问答中面临关键证据分散在数百万token中的挑战，现有的'边读边记'方法存在不可逆的前向处理、信息覆盖丢失和稀疏强化学习信号等问题。

Method: ReMemR1采用回调增强记忆机制，允许从整个记忆历史中选择性检索，支持非线性推理和早期证据重新访问；同时提出强化学习多级奖励(RLMLR)，结合最终答案奖励和密集的步骤级信号来指导有效的内存使用。

Result: 在长文档问答实验中，相比现有基于记忆的方法取得了显著提升，验证了ReMemR1作为长上下文推理代理的有效解决方案。

Conclusion: ReMemR1通过缓解信息退化、改进监督和支持多跳内存利用，为长上下文推理代理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering,
where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens.
Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is
dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the
"memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it
suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through
overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these
challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced
memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and
allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further
strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards
(RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals
that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate
information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory
utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing
memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for
long-context reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在多方辩论系统中的奉承行为，提出了首个针对MADS的奉承行为操作框架，揭示了奉承是导致辩论崩溃的核心失败模式，并提出了设计原则来平衡生产性分歧与合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的奉承行为会破坏多方辩论系统的有效性，导致辩论过早达成共识，影响创新思维和论证精炼。现有研究主要关注用户-LLM奉承，而代理间奉承在辩论中的影响尚未充分理解。

Method: 提出了首个操作框架：1) 为MADS环境定义奉承行为；2) 开发新指标评估代理奉承水平及其对信息交换的影响；3) 系统研究不同奉承水平在分散式和集中式辩论框架中对结果的影响。

Result: 发现奉承是核心失败模式，会在达到正确结论前放大分歧崩溃，导致比单代理基线更低的准确性，并源于不同的辩手驱动和法官驱动失败模式。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了MADS的可操作设计原则，有效平衡代理交互中的生产性分歧与合作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward
excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for
multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to
refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can
collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits
of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the
impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To
address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1)
proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2)
develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on
information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying
levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes
in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal
that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse
before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower
accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven
and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose
actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive
disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Motivation: 获取监督数据成本上升推动了大语言模型的自改进需求。传统自评估方法存在计算开销大和过度自信的问题，而多数投票等无监督信号在不可验证任务中应用受限。

Method: 提出语义投票机制，将硬匹配（精确匹配）放松为软匹配（语义相似度），使用轻量级句子嵌入模型量化语义相似度，避免传统自评估的计算负担和内在偏见。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在计算效率上取得显著提升，在多种模型架构和任务上的整体性能优于自评估方法。

Conclusion: 语义投票为不可验证任务提供了一种轻量级且有效的自改进方法，解决了传统自评估方法的计算开销和偏见问题。

Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest
in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward
unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating
pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable
tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses.
As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy
minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However,
self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead
and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable
tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by
majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic
voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e.,
exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching
is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify
semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and
intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in
computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation
methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG代理开发缺乏过程级监督来有效指导任务分解、检索器调用和逐步决策能力。强化学习存在稀疏奖励问题，现有数据合成方法只能产生思维链推理而无法建模环境交互。

Method: EviPath包含三个核心组件：(1)溯因子任务规划，将问题分解为子问题并基于依赖关系规划最优解决路径；(2)忠实子问题回答，使用支持证据构建代理环境来生成每个子问题的推理思路和答案；(3)对话微调，将完整的代理-环境交互轨迹格式化为适合监督微调的对话格式。

Result: 在广泛使用的问答基准测试中，使用EviPath合成数据训练的8B参数模型显著且持续地优于最先进的基线方法，在开放域问答中实现了14.7%的绝对EM增益。

Conclusion: EviPath使LLM能够直接从合成数据中学习复杂推理和工具使用能力，为RAG代理开发提供了有效的训练数据合成方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of
process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task
decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While
reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse
rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought
rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we
propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG
agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which
decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal
solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful
Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy
environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question;
and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete
agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for
Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and
tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on
widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model
trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of
14.7% in open-domain question answering.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型在创造性任务中的不确定性是一个基本挑战，特别是在存在多个有效输出的情况下，需要量化模型与人类创作变化之间的校准程度。

Method: 使用置信集（概率分布的凸包）几何框架，分析WritingPrompts数据集中500个创意写作提示，每个提示有10个人类续写，评估4个语言模型和5种解码策略，生成10万篇故事。

Result: 置信集分析显示模型在捕捉人类创作变化方面存在显著差距，最佳模型-人类校准仅为0.434（Gemma-2B，温度0.7）。解码策略选择贡献了39.4%到72.0%的总认知不确定性。模型规模与校准质量相关性弱，基础模型和指令调优模型在校准质量上无显著差异。

Conclusion: 几何框架为改进生成系统以实现人机创作对齐提供了可操作的见解，并发布了完整的实验框架。

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental
challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist.
We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of
probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural
text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500
creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human
continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding
strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals
substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best
model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We
decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding
that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total
epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration
quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned
models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable
insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We
release our complete experimental framework.

TL;DR: d²Cache是一个无需训练的双向自适应KV缓存框架，用于加速基于扩散的大语言模型推理，通过两阶段细粒度选择策略识别和更新关键token的KV状态，同时缓存其余token以供重用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的大语言模型依赖双向注意力机制，无法直接受益于自回归模型的标准KV缓存，导致推理效率低下。

Method: 提出d²Cache框架，采用两阶段细粒度选择策略：识别关键token并自适应更新其KV状态，同时缓存其他token的KV状态以供重用。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream两个代表性dLLM上的实验表明，d²Cache不仅实现了显著的推理加速，还带来了生成质量的持续提升。

Conclusion: d²Cache为dLLM提供了一种有效的推理加速方案，同时支持准从左到右生成，缓解了序列末端token的过早过度自信问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising
performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because
dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the
standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle
this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a
training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference.
d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify
tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while
caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore,
d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can
enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in
tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two
representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not
only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent
improvements in generation quality. The code is available at

Motivation: 在少样本设置下，大语言模型使用SMILES表示生成有效分子具有挑战性，而SELFIES表示虽然能保证有效性但性能更差。需要一种方法既能确保分子有效性，又能保持生成质量。

Method: 开发了SmiSelf跨化学语言框架，使用语法规则将无效SMILES转换为SELFIES，利用SELFIES的机制来修正无效SMILES。

Result: SmiSelf确保了100%的分子有效性，同时保持了分子特性，在其他指标上维持甚至提升了性能。

Conclusion: SmiSelf扩展了大语言模型在生物医学中的实际应用，并与所有基于SMILES的生成模型兼容。

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling
the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models
(LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples.
However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is
challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs
can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a
representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid
molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with
SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their
capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language
framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to
SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the
invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while
preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing
performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications
in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code

Result: 在MultiWOZ和τ-bench上的实验显示，当遇到非协作用户时，最先进的工具代理性能显著下降，出现幻觉增加和对话崩溃等问题。

Conclusion: 提供了一个易于扩展的用户模拟框架，帮助研究社区开发工具代理并在具有挑战性的现实条件下预先诊断它们。

Simulation TL;DR: A non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agent.
Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to
accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods
to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user
simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors,
which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the
real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture
that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting
unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing
impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can
simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably
delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our
experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance
degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative
users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each
non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue
breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation
framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively
diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own
services.

TL;DR: TagPR是一个通过标记思维方法增强LLM个性化推理能力的训练框架，在LaMP基准测试上比基础模型平均提升32.65%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用推理方面表现出色，但在个性化推理方面存在困难，需要分析用户历史、推断独特偏好并生成定制化响应

Method: 开发数据驱动管道自动生成和语义标记推理链，然后采用监督微调建立基础推理模式，接着进行多阶段强化学习，使用包含标签约束和个性化奖励模型的复合奖励信号

Result: 在LaMP基准测试和自建数据集上取得最先进结果，平均比基础模型提升32.65%

Conclusion: 结构化、可解释的推理是解锁LLM真正个性化能力的有效途径

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive
general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization
reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique
preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we
introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an
LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the
thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to
automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a
structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a
synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a
unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a
novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve
fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the
public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement
of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that
structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking
genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

*Zichao Yu,Ming Li,Wenyi Zhang,Weiguo Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TReASURe是一种基于树搜索的测试时对齐方法，通过UnmaskBranch分支策略和ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，解决了掩码扩散语言模型中树搜索的两个关键挑战：并行解掩码导致高度相关分支和奖励评估的高方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将树搜索应用于掩码扩散语言模型时面临两个主要挑战：(i)并行解掩码产生高度相关的分支，限制了探索；(ii)通过采样完成进行奖励评估会产生高方差估计，导致剪枝不稳定。

Method: 提出TReASURe方法，包含两个核心组件：(1)UnmaskBranch分支策略，基于首次命中解掩码，通过每个父节点单次模型调用实现令牌内容和揭示顺序的多样化；(2)ResubstituteScore剪枝规则，使用确定性重替换以低方差代理完成来评分部分掩码序列。

Result: 在困惑度、语言可接受性以及情感和毒性控制方面达到最先进结果，在匹配计算预算下优于先前方法，在低NFE（函数评估次数）情况下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: TReASURe通过理论分析和实证验证，证明了在掩码扩散语言模型中应用树搜索的有效性，特别是在分支多样性和奖励评估稳定性方面的改进，为测试时对齐提供了强大的框架。

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning
generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search
to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges:
(i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration,
and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance
estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search
test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i)
UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that
diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per
parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic
resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy
completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs
(number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the
true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove
improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves
state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control
of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute
budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

TL;DR: 提出T2PAM范式，利用用户反馈作为奖励信号来估计最优策略，并通过ROSA算法实现高效的单步参数更新，使模型在对话中自我修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长对话中性能下降，因为它们在静态单轮数据上训练，难以适应实时用户反馈。

Method: 提出T2PAM范式，使用用户反馈作为奖励信号估计最优策略，然后通过ROSA算法进行轻量级单步参数更新。

Result: 理论分析证明ROSA策略会收敛到用户偏好，实验显示在任务效果和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: T2PAM和ROSA有效解决了LLMs在长对话中的性能退化问题，实现了高效的自适应对话能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental
paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often
degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static,
single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user
feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm:
Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes
user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a
latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small
subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling
efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced
One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM.
ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a
single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based
optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous
theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the
preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant
improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

*Boyi Zeng,He Li,Shixiang Song,Yixuan Wang,Ziwei He,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的预训练方法：用潜在思维预训练语言模型。该方法让语言模型在预测每个实际token之前先生成一个中间潜在思维（当前隐藏状态），然后用这个潜在思维来预测实际的下一个token，从而在无约束连续空间中优化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Chain-of-Thought（CoT）在测试时通过扩展生成步骤提升性能的启发，探索是否可以在预训练阶段通过扩展计算步骤来改进每个单独token的生成质量。

Method: 预训练语言模型先生成中间潜在思维（最后一个隐藏状态），然后使用该潜在思维作为输入来预测实际的下一个token。可以生成多个潜在思维形成类似CoT的链来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在相同推理成本下，生成一个额外潜在思维的1.4B参数模型显著优于标准2.8B参数模型。在300B Pile数据上预训练的模型在语言建模和多个下游任务上都超越了标准Pythia-2.8B模型。增加潜在思维数量能持续提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过预训练阶段引入额外的计算步骤生成潜在思维，可以在不增加推理成本的情况下显著提升语言模型的性能，这为改进语言模型预训练提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance
by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a
similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the
generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel
pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our
approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate
latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used
as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational
step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous
space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM
that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard
model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch),
pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla
Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of
general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts
generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to
CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个三阶段框架来诊断、定位和对齐LLM多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，通过手术式微调提高系统可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM多智能体系统在复杂任务中表现出色，但在可靠性关键部署中受到系统级故障模式的限制：在指令冲突时智能体会错误地优先处理系统级规则，而现有的宏观指标无法有效检测这些微观违规行为。

Method: 三阶段框架：(1) 诊断 - 上下文角色遵守评分(CRAS)，将角色遵守分解为四个可测量维度；(2) 定位 - 注意力漂移分析，发现指令冲突主要由中间层注意力头解决；(3) 对齐 - 手术式指令层对齐(SAIL)，仅在定位的焦点层安装LoRA，并使用基于令牌权重的DPO风格偏好目标进行优化。

Result: 在标准基准测试和多智能体框架中，该方法显著提高了指令层次结构的遵守率（例如在AutoGen上MedQA任务中提升+5.60%），且无需全模型微调。

Conclusion: 提出的手术式对齐方法能够有效解决LLM多智能体系统中的指令冲突问题，提高系统可靠性，同时避免了全模型微调的计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly
advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination
in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by
a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts
(system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the
presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g.,
pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable
guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage
framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a
query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into
four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing
that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely
concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction
Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and
optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens
by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS
frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance
(e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

*Nan Wang,Jiaxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过眼动追踪和脑电图数据发现，在自然阅读中，短语结构构建先于句法类别检测，且结构深度比词汇因素更能驱动阅读行为，支持"树形支架"预测性理解模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句法处理时序研究多基于违反范式，混淆了句法类别检测和短语结构构建两个过程，并隐含假设短语结构构建在类别检测之后。本研究旨在自然阅读条件下分离这两个过程并测试其时间顺序。

Method: 使用ZuCo语料库中同时记录的EEG和眼动追踪数据，分析注视转移模式、贝叶斯网络建模以及注视相关电位。

Result: 注视转移显示读者优先在句法核心词间移动；结构深度是偏离线性阅读的最强驱动因素；句法惊奇度在单词出现前(-184到-10ms)和早期整合阶段(48到300ms)影响神经活动。

Conclusion: 短语结构构建可以优先于句法类别检测并主导词汇影响，支持预测性的"树形支架"理解模型，扩展了当前句法处理时序模型。

Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence
processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which
conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase
structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows
category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking
data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their
temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze
transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads,
suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize
scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was
the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical
familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated
that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to
-10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend
current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure
construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences,
supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，经过验证器强化学习训练的推理大语言模型在使用少样本思维链时性能反而比直接回答更差，即使使用高质量演示也会随着示例增加而精度下降。

Method: 提出I2S框架，通过语义分析将演示转化为明确的、可重用的见解，并生成目标特定的推理轨迹；I2S+版本还包含自我精炼步骤以确保推理的连贯性和正确性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，I2S和I2S+始终优于直接回答和测试时扩展基线方法，GPT-4.1在AIME'25上提升14.0%，o1-mini在AIME和GPQA上分别提升2.7%和1.7%。

Conclusion: 通过洞察-精炼-解决框架，可以有效地利用上下文演示来提升推理模型的性能，解决了少样本思维链推理中的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based
reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct
answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from
DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently
degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis
reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where
high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the
exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer
failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and
apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve
(I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into
explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace;
optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+).
Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently
outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open-
and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25,
GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on
GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively
via insight-refine-solve framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究K-pop在全球市场成功背后的语言策略，特别是语码转换和英语歌词使用的作用。

Method: 收集2017-2025年登上Billboard榜单的K-pop歌曲数据集，分析英语和韩语歌词比例、语码转换频率等特征，并进行统计测试和分类任务。

Result: 英语在全球化K-pop歌曲中占主导，语码转换频繁；无显著性别差异，但女性独唱歌手更倾向于使用英语；分类任务F1分数达0.76；Hot 100榜单对英语使用要求更高。

Conclusion: K-pop歌词的语言选择受全球市场压力影响，反映了表演者身份和榜单背景的风格模式。

Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a
defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global
market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic
strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a
focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop
songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to
2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset,
the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching,
and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates
the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and
female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage.
Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although
female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification
task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving
macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted
features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the
Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender
difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in
the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop
lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that
reflect performer identity and chart context.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析Gemma-2语言模型，揭示了模型在生成介词短语时对工具性补语和属性性补语的偏好机制，并实现了通过调控单个注意力头来改变补语功能角色的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言模型在生成介词短语时如何决定补语是作为工具性附加语还是属性修饰语的内在机制，这一决策机制目前尚不明确。

Method: 构建包含with引导的介词短语提示集，通过将激活投影到词汇空间来识别偏好工具性补语的注意力头，然后缩放单个注意力头的值向量来调控补语功能角色的分布。

Result: 模型对工具性补语有强烈偏好（3:4比例），通过调控单个注意力头可将工具性补语降至33%，同时将属性性补语提升至36%。

Conclusion: 语言模型内部存在特定的注意力机制负责介词短语补语功能角色的决策，这种机制可以通过定向干预来调控，为理解模型的语言处理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for
whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the
verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally),
yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly
understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to
uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a
prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts
equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation,
revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To
pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive
complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the
value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of
functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating
attributes to 36%.

Motivation: 现实应用如旅行规划或多阶段数据分析通常涉及多轮对话，现有方法要么将多轮训练简化为孤立单轮样本而忽略任务级规划，要么使用端到端强化学习但存在冗余问题且缺乏明确的进度感知整合。

Method: 提出PARL-MT框架，包含：(1)进度感知生成(PAG)管道，自动构建耦合对话摘要与未来任务规划的数据集；(2)进度感知引导的强化学习(PAG-RL)算法，将进度感知整合到RL训练中，减少上下文冗余并改善局部动作与全局任务完成的对齐。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试上的实证结果表明，PARL-MT显著优于现有方法，突显了进度感知在实现稳健高效多轮函数调用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 进度感知机制对于LLM在多轮函数调用中的表现至关重要，PARL-MT框架通过显式整合进度感知，有效解决了长期任务执行中的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn
function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or
multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In
these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step
but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past
interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task
execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to
isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ
end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks
explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness
into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a
Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs
datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a
Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which
integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy
and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT
significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of
progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function
calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of
current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for
traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a
quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was
constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering
evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert
critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features,
several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This
framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or
Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the
VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings
reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of
VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and
limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks. The

Method: 提出了CLAIRE系统，结合LLM推理与检索来发现潜在不一致声明并提供上下文证据供人工审查。通过随机抽样和CLAIRE辅助分析构建WIKICOLLIDE基准数据集。

Result: 在用户研究中，87.5%的维基百科编辑报告使用CLAIRE时信心更高，参与者在相同时间内识别出64.7%更多的不一致性。研究发现至少3.3%的英文维基百科事实存在矛盾，这些不一致性传播到7.3%的FEVEROUS和4.0%的AmbigQA示例中。

Conclusion: 矛盾是维基百科中可测量的组成部分，基于LLM的系统如CLAIRE可以为编辑提供实用工具，帮助大规模提高知识一致性。

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and
serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is
therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and
introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE,
an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface
potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human
review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported
higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more
inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first
benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with
CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts
contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS
and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset
reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC
of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia
and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help
editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

*Soumick Sarker,Abhijit Kumar Rai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-ExBERT是一个轻量级模块化框架，用于从金融客服通话中提取用户意图相关的句子，采用领域适应的BERT模型和LoRA适配器，通过两阶段训练策略实现高效微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融对话记录具有非正式结构、领域特定词汇和可变意图密度等特点，给句子级信息提取带来独特挑战，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 基于领域适应BERT骨干网络，使用LoRA适配器增强，采用两阶段渐进解冻训练策略（先训练分类头再微调整个模型），并采用基于概率曲率的动态阈值策略。

Result: 在真实世界对话记录上表现出强大的精确度和F1分数，输出可解释性强，适用于下游审计和问答工作流。

Conclusion: 该框架支持批量评估、可视化和校准导出，为金融对话挖掘提供了可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level
information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific
vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight
and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from
annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced
with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using
limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive
unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone,
followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning
rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic
thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection),
avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and
F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable
for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework
supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a
deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2D是一种针对扩散大语言模型的令牌级对齐方法，通过在任何有害内容出现时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，提供对任意解码顺序和预填充攻击的鲁棒性防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的任意顺序生成特性扩大了攻击面，有害内容可能出现在任意位置，且基于模板的预填充攻击可以绕过响应级拒绝机制。

Method: 通过令牌级对齐，在随机掩码条件下训练模型在有害内容出现时发出[EOS]拒绝信号，实现实时监控和自动终止不安全生成。

Result: 在安全基准测试中，A2D将DIJA攻击成功率从80%以上降至接近零（LLaDA-8B-Instruct为1.3%，Dream-v0-Instruct-7B为0.0%），并通过阈值化[EOS]概率实现早期拒绝，安全终止速度提升达19.3倍。

Conclusion: A2D方法有效解决了扩散大语言模型的安全漏洞，提供了对任意顺序和任意步骤攻击的鲁棒防御，同时支持实时安全监控。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this
flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary
positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass
response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a
token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal
whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level
under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order
and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables
real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if
unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents
the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to
near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and
thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x
faster safe termination.

### [403] [Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23291)
*Joseph Marvin Imperial,Harish Tayyar Madabushi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了政策推理轨迹（PRT）方法，通过生成专门的推理链来提升LLM在政策合规评估中的能力，显著提高了HIPAA和GDPR政策的评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政策合规评估需要专家级的分步推理过程，但这种黄金标准的推理过程获取成本高昂，因此需要一种方法来提升LLM的政策合规评估能力。

Method: 引入政策推理轨迹（PRT）作为专门的生成推理链，在推理时和训练时使用这些轨迹来增强LLM的政策合规评估能力。

Result: 实证评估表明，使用PRT显著提升了开源和商业模型的性能，在HIPAA和GDPR政策评估中达到了新的最先进水平，同时提高了政策条款引用的准确性。

Conclusion: PRT通过提供高质量的推理链，有效提升了LLM的政策合规评估能力，不仅提高了准确性，还增强了政策条款引用能力。

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an
input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally
known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step
process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined
in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level
reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy
Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that
serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment
capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for
both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the
performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new
state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also
highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy
clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high
utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SIE框架通过从大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，解决了现有环境在可扩展性、泛化推理和可验证性方面的不足，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学和编码环境依赖专家标注难以扩展，游戏环境学到的技能过于专门化难以泛化，需要构建兼具可扩展性、泛化推理和可验证性的理想LLM推理环境。

Method: 提出结构化上下文环境(SIE)框架，利用大规模结构化数据自动构建推理环境，利用其丰富的组合模式支持泛化推理，并通过显式模式和推理链实现基于规则的可验证性。

Result: SIE框架在领域内结构化推理上取得显著提升，学到的组合推理技能能有效泛化到领域外数学和逻辑推理任务。在信息受限的部分SIE中，LLM能通过环境探索推断缺失信息，实现稳健推理改进和泛化性能。

Conclusion: SIE框架成功构建了兼具可扩展性、泛化推理和可验证性的LLM推理环境，显著提升了推理能力并实现了有效的技能泛化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental
exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the
abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL
finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three
core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability.
However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale
due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in
game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap,
we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment
(SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing
reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich
compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the
explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation
for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not
only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but
also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize
effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We
further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that
LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment,
leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

TL;DR: C-Evolve是一种基于共识的进化算法，通过聚合多个提示的输出并采用多数投票机制来提升AI系统性能，在各类任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示进化算法主要关注单个提示的优化，但很少探索通过聚合多个提示的结果达成共识是否能进一步提升系统能力边界。

Method: 采用基于岛屿的进化算法维持种群多样性，从不同岛屿选择提示组成群体，通过多数投票聚合输出，使用投票评分作为适应度分数而非个体性能。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上，HotpotQA达到70.67%，IFBench达到43.88%，分别比GEPA提升4.95%和2.73%；在GPT-4.1-mini上，IFBench达到47.96%，MATH基准达到95.33%。

Conclusion: C-Evolve通过群体共识机制能够产生和维护具有更高潜力的提示，逐步提升群体性能，在各种任务中表现出竞争优势。

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI
systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether
aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further
advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce
Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group
of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal
performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary
algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands
are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from
single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual
prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for
evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more
likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a
high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving
the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both
open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B,
C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and
2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench
is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These
results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个统一的机器学习遗忘框架，通过在表示空间和参数空间实施双重平滑性来提高鲁棒性和平衡遗忘指标，解决了现有方法中的灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，机器学习遗忘技术需要解决用户隐私、版权侵权和安全问题。现有最先进的遗忘方法存在灾难性遗忘和指标不平衡的问题，且容易受到重新学习和越狱攻击的威胁。

Method: PRISM框架包含两个平滑优化阶段：(1) 表示空间阶段使用鲁棒训练的探针防御越狱攻击；(2) 参数空间阶段解耦保留-遗忘梯度冲突，减少不平衡，并平滑参数空间以缓解重新学习攻击。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRISM在多种攻击下优于现有最先进基线方法，同时在关键指标之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: PRISM通过双重空间平滑性有效解决了机器学习遗忘中的鲁棒性和指标平衡问题，在对话和连续文本设置中均表现出色。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has
emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright
infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning
methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for
example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness,
utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In
addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be
exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in
representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance
unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a
representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend
against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples
retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter
space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE,
across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM
outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better
balance among key metrics.

TL;DR: MedCritical提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架，通过小语言模型自我对抗训练来提升医学复杂推理能力，避免了传统知识蒸馏方法的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域的复杂推理任务（如临床诊断、治疗规划）对小型语言模型具有挑战性，传统基于教师模型的知识蒸馏方法在成本、时间和效率方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段从教师模型提取长链思维模板指导学生模型生成复杂推理；第二阶段通过模型自我迭代协作的直接偏好优化（DPO），让学生模型与微调后的修正轨迹对抗训练。

Result: MedCritical 7B模型在CMExam基准测试中分别超越Taiyi和Huatuo-o1-7B模型3.04%和10.12%，在7B级别小型模型中达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模型自我学习的DPO方法，以较低成本实现了与传统知识蒸馏方法相当的效果，为小型语言模型在医学复杂推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis,
treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant
challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large
language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based
methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction,
but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and
efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework,
MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher
model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and
detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the
student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage,
we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration
collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing
against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This
model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own
error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex
problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation
methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model
outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\%
respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among
7B-class small models.

TL;DR: MetaAPO是一个新颖的偏好优化框架，通过元学习器动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，有效解决离线偏好数据与模型策略之间的分布不匹配问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异且显著降低在线标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理离线偏好数据与演化模型策略之间的分布不匹配问题时，往往使用静态启发式或解耦的在线采样策略，无法适应模型的动态学习状态。

Method: 提出MetaAPO框架，使用轻量级元学习器作为"对齐差距估计器"评估在线采样的潜在收益，指导有针对性的在线生成，并为优化目标分配样本级元权重，动态平衡在线和离线数据的质量与分布。

Result: 在AlpacaEval 2、Arena-Hard和MT-Bench上的实验表明，MetaAPO在各种设置下始终优于现有的偏好优化方法，同时减少了42%的在线标注成本。

Conclusion: MetaAPO通过动态耦合数据生成与模型训练，有效解决了偏好优化中的分布不匹配问题，在提升性能的同时显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is
the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the
evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static
heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to
adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose
Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework
that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a
lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the
potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This
guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the
optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of
online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench
demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference
optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online
annotation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学中常产生临床无依据的描述（医学幻觉），这在要求准确性和图像基础输出的医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: CCD是一个无需训练和检索的推理框架，通过整合来自特定任务放射学专家模型的结构化临床信号，在生成过程中使用双阶段对比机制来优化token级logits。

Result: 在三个数据集和多个模型上的实验表明，CCD持续提升放射学报告生成性能。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上，应用于最先进的RRG模型时，RadGraph-F1指标提升高达17%。

Conclusion: CCD提供了一个轻量级且可泛化的解决方案，有效减轻医学幻觉问题，在放射学中成功桥接专家模型和多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language
understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported
descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in
medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through
empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent
in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To
address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free
and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical
signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage
contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby
enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on
three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves
overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR
dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to
state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and
generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively
bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Motivation: 解决现有防护模型在多语言支持、模型可移植性和流式处理方面的局限性，降低数据和计算需求，促进更负责任的AI生态系统。

Method: 使用参数差异计算安全任务向量，结合流式感知方法，包括基于前缀的训练评估和单令牌输出的分类器设计。

Result: 在标准安全套件上提升了分类质量，支持中文、日文和韩文扩展，无需额外训练或目标语言标签，在Llama和Gemma骨架上实现模型可移植性。

Conclusion: Guard Vector方法有效提升了防护模型的性能、可扩展性和实用性，通过流式感知设计和单令牌输出优化了吞吐量和延迟。

Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter
difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture
pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model
yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware
approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier
that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves
classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety
suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean,
requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also
demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail
backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM
preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior
between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design
increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce
data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation
practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

Motivation: 预训练实验是理解大语言模型学习机制的重要工具，但计算成本高昂限制了实验规模。

Method: 在单次训练运行中同时进行多个预训练实验，使用1.5B参数模型在210B tokens上训练，包含数据污染、中毒、记忆化等实验。

Result: 成功复现了多个先前工作的结果，并进行了知识获取、数学推理和水印等新研究，实验对训练动态和整体性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 单次训练运行中进行多个预训练实验的方法可以在有限计算预算下实现严谨的大模型科学实验。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a
powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large
language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents
a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct
multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments
during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only
train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works
on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel
investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and
watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the
model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of
the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is
minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a
potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with
continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup.
Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments
in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with
large models on a compute budget.

Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在稳定性差、效率低、容易陷入局部最优的问题，需要更高效的优化策略。

Method: 提出GRACE框架，包含门控精炼策略（反馈调节门和更新拒绝门）和自适应压缩策略（提炼核心概念，重构优化轨迹）。

Result: 在11个任务上的实验显示，相比现有方法，GRACE在BIG-Bench Hard、领域特定和通用NLP任务上分别实现了4.7%、4.4%和2.7%的平均相对性能提升，且仅需25%的提示生成预算。

Conclusion: GRACE通过战略性地引入信息损失，在提示优化中实现了显著的性能提升和效率改进，为大规模语言模型的高效利用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large
language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable
alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains
challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved
prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization
easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a
framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and
Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated
refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update
rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective
prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression
strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization
trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss
through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in
performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three
practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general
NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements
of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further
analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt
generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization
efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前机器翻译在处理文化绑定术语时面临挑战，现有方法只关注文本内解决方案，忽略了专业翻译人员在脚注和尾注中使用的副文本工具。

Method: 基于Genette的副文本理论，构建了560个专业对齐的副文本数据集，评估了带和不带推理轨迹的LLM在显化选择和内容方面的表现，使用了内在提示和代理检索方法。

Result: 实验表明该任务具有挑战性，LLM生成的副文本能提高受众理解度，但效果仍远不如翻译人员创作的副文本。统计分析显示专业翻译人员在副文本使用上存在很大差异。

Conclusion: 副文本显化有潜力推动机器翻译超越语言对等，在单语解释和个性化适应方面具有有前景的扩展应用。

Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge
contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of
culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or
cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational
approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text
solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes
employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's
(1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce
the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560
expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical
Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without
reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across
intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of
this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve
audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than
translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis
reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of
paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，探索其在自动评分中的应用，并理解人类和LLM评分员的推理过程，以识别评分不一致的潜在原因。

Method: 使用大规模测试的作文数据，基于二次加权Kappa和归一化互信息评估LLM评分准确性，使用余弦相似度评估理由相似性，并通过主成分分析探索理由的聚类模式。

Result: 研究发现提供了关于LLM在自动评分中准确性和"思维"的见解，帮助理解人类评分和基于LLM的自动评分背后的理由。

Conclusion: 通过分析人类和LLM评分员的理由，可以改进对自动评分中推理过程的理解，为提升评分一致性提供参考。

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in
machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent
progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude,
and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given
their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to
support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by
both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning
that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates
the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring
inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of
GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa
and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the
similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in
rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the
embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into
the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve
the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based
automated scoring.

TL;DR: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，通过限制模型输出为唯一表面形式来更准确评估语言模型的知识能力，在YAGO-QA数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型编码了大量事实知识，但由于评估过于严格，许多正确答案因表达形式不同而被误判为错误，导致低估了模型的参数化知识。

Method: 提出检索约束解码(RCD)策略，限制模型输出为知识库中存在的唯一表面形式，使用YAGO-QA数据集(19,137个常识问题)进行评估。

Result: 在135M到70B参数的开放源码语言模型上，RCD显著提升了性能。Llama-3.1-70B从32.3% F1提升到46.0%，Llama-3.1-8B达到33.0%，甚至超过了更大模型的标准解码表现。

Conclusion: 标准解码方法低估了语言模型的知识能力，RCD方法能更准确地评估模型的参数化知识，证明了模型实际知识比传统评估显示的要丰富。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce
answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are
actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are
dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of
models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD),
a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We
introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating
open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding
undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1
with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0%
with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly
share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

TL;DR: CooT是一个解码时框架，通过认知自我监控循环让LLM在推理过程中动态检测和纠正有害行为，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐策略将安全控制嵌入模型权重，导致控制隐式、静态且难以修改。需要一种显式、动态、可审计的对齐方法。

Method: CooT将标准文本生成器与认知感知器耦合，感知器使用基于优先级的规则层次结构持续监控生成序列，检测到违规时回滚到错误点并在注入指导下重新生成。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型系列上的广泛实验证实，CooT持续提升了安全性和社交推理性能。

Conclusion: CooT将对齐从固定属性转变为在推理过程中活跃的显式、动态、可审计过程，允许灵活的政策更新而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit
harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into
model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify.
This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time
framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop.
CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that
continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured,
precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to
detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT
intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and
regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with
context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property
into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference,
allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT
consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

Motivation: 传统项目难度建模依赖现场测试和经典测试理论或项目反应理论标定，过程耗时且成本高昂。文本方法利用机器学习和语言模型有望克服这些挑战。

Method: 系统综述37篇相关文献，分析每项研究的数据集、难度参数、学科领域、项目类型、输入特征、模型架构和评估标准。

Result: 结果显示，经典机器学习模型因可解释性仍具相关性，而先进的基于transformer的语言模型无需手动特征工程即可捕捉句法和语义模式。文本方法预测项目难度的RMSE最低可达0.165，Pearson相关最高达0.87，准确率最高达0.806。

Conclusion: 文本方法有潜力高效预测项目难度，为实践提供参考，并为未来自动项目难度建模研究指明方向。

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of
scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments.
Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and
classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT)
calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these
challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language
models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and
synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale
assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate
the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items,
training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and
model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine
learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art
language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures,
can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature
engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a
benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the
potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.
The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining
future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt
engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts
remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations
in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from
OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models'
performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest
the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

TL;DR: 提出一个用于阿拉伯语情感分析的主动学习框架，通过LLM辅助标注来减少标注成本，在三个基准数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语情感分析因缺乏大规模高质量标注数据集而进展有限，需要探索主动学习和LLM辅助标注来降低标注成本。

Method: 使用主动学习框架，评估LSTM、GRU和RNN等深度学习架构，在三个阿拉伯语数据集上比较人类标注和LLM辅助标注两种策略，测试了5种LLM作为标注器。

Result: LLM辅助的主动学习在减少标注样本数量的同时，取得了与人类标注相当或更好的性能，如在Hunger Station数据集上仅用450个样本达到93%准确率。

Conclusion: LLM辅助的主动学习是阿拉伯语情感分析中降低标注成本的有效方法，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著减少标注工作量。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a
vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media
monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However,
progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large,
high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in
reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in
Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for
assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still
largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active
learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation
costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning
architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent
units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark
datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard
Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are
compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as
annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3
70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for
Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our
results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station
dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples
using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat
reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained
through human labeling.

TL;DR: 本文研究了微调LLM作为评判模型在实际部署中的三个关键问题：未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化能力。实验发现在数学领域，未来兼容性最具挑战，而向后兼容性相对容易实现，DPO训练模型表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微调评判模型逐渐成为比直接提示前沿模型更优的选择，标准评估忽略了实际部署中的关键问题。本文旨在研究评判模型在面对不断变化的生成模型时的实际适用性。

Method: 在数学领域建立统一框架，研究不同训练和测试分布下的表现，使用三种SFT和DPO微调算法以及三个不同的基础模型，分析评判模型在未来兼容性、向后兼容性和问题泛化方面的表现。

Result: 实验表明：未来兼容性对大多数模型具有挑战性；向后兼容性相对容易实现，DPO训练模型持续提升性能；持续学习比仅训练于强或弱响应更能平衡适应新旧响应分布；所有模型在从训练中见过的问题转向未见问题时都出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前评判模型未能完全泛化到未见问题，这些发现为在不断变化的生成模型环境中开发和部署评判模型提供了实践指导。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model
responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently,
finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred
choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former
achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to
common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical
concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this
paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of
these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges
finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by
future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well
judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three
aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and
test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three
different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging
for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with
DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that
continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older
and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker
responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance
degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,
showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These
findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and
deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Motivation: 现有CoT蒸馏方法低估了推理链质量的重要性，主要关注数据数量，这可能导致将噪声或错误信息传递给学生模型。

Method: 提出模型导向推理选择蒸馏(MoRSD)，能够识别和选择高质量推理链进行蒸馏。还提出推理难度(RD)指标来衡量学生模型在给定推理链下生成正确答案的能力。

Result: 在三个任务的七个数据集上相比基线平均提升4.6%，通过控制推理链的准确性、多样性和难度，使用更少的推理链实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 少量高质量推理链比整个数据集更能提升学生模型的推理能力，该方法为高效CoT蒸馏提供了可能的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models'
(SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the
larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality,
focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect
information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed
\textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election
\textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality
rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose
a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model
to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the
baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three
tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and
difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality
rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire
dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT
distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Motivation: 目前缺乏开放的、基于执行的文本到JQL映射基准测试，企业团队依赖JQL从Jira检索问题。

Method: 创建包含四种用户请求类型的JQL查询配对：(i)长自然语言，(ii)短自然语言，(iii)语义相似，(iv)语义精确。在23个大型语言模型上评估执行准确率、精确匹配和规范精确匹配。

Result: 在Jackal-5K子集上，最佳模型(Gemini 2.5 Pro)平均执行准确率仅为60.3%。性能在不同请求类型间差异显著：长自然语言(86.0%)、短自然语言(35.7%)、语义相似(22.7%)、语义精确(99.3%)。

Conclusion: Jackal暴露了当前最先进LLM的局限性，为Jira企业数据研究设定了新的基于执行的挑战。

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter
issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world,
execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We
introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000
natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and
execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To
reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user
requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv)
Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs,
together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the
evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on
23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed
source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact
match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of
Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only
60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types.
Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL
(86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv)
Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce
correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current
state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future
research in Jira enterprise data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流幻觉检测方法依赖事实一致性验证或静态隐藏层特征，前者受知识覆盖范围限制，后者难以捕捉推理过程中的偏差。受认知神经科学信号分析方法的启发，需要开发能有效检测推理过程中幻觉的新方法。

Result: 频谱特征分析实验证明了该方法的有效性。HSAD方法在检测准确性和鲁棒性方面表现更优，能够克服现有方法在知识覆盖范围和推理偏差检测方面的限制。

Conclusion: 通过有效结合推理过程建模和频域特征提取，HSAD方法为LLM幻觉检测提供了新的解决方案，在关键应用场景中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a
wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the
frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become
a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios.
Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency
verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the
scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning
biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by
signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a
hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden
layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal
\textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's
reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose
modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and
discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal
signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal
signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are
used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis
experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this
approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on
these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By
effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with
frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations
of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of
reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练被认为只是表面调整，虽然提高了利用能力但限制了探索能力，存在关键权衡问题。

Method: 通过部分恢复Instruct模型向配对Base模型的回归，对权重增量进行细微但有针对性的精炼。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen系列上的广泛实验表明，Timber能持续改进普通Instruct模型，特别是在Pass@k性能上。

Conclusion: 研究为后训练阶段提供了权重级别的新见解，以及无需训练即可精炼Instruct模型的实用策略。

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding
Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first
reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the
weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed.
However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the
exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle
this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that
enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its
exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the
paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas.
Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber
consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k
performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at
the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without
training.

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中实现了竞争性或更优的准确性，同时显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型的高效可控推理提供了一条实用路径，通过隐式策略指导减少不必要的token生成，抑制过度思考。

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating
explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on
large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex
reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that
increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks
for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during
training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the
model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the
codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing
explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a
lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook
guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking
and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple
reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path
toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了RemeDi模型，通过引入remasking机制，使基于掩码的扩散语言模型能够识别和重新掩码低质量token，实现更灵活的文本精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统掩码扩散语言模型无法修正错误token的问题，一旦生成token就固定不变，难以识别输入中的潜在错误。

Method: 联合预测token分布和置信度分数，基于置信度决定哪些token需要重新掩码；采用包含监督微调和强化学习的remask感知训练流程。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了开源扩散语言模型中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: RemeDi通过remasking机制显著提升了扩散语言模型的文本精炼能力，为扩散式文本生成提供了更灵活的修正方法。

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect
tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key
challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we
propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion
Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as
another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in
diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token
distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence
scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing
the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked
tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a
remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning
which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to
predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation
trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the
state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了强化学习（RL）和监督微调（SFT）在跨语言推理泛化方面的表现，发现RL不仅在准确性上优于SFT，而且在跨语言泛化能力上显著更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在提升复杂推理能力方面表现出色，但其与监督微调在跨语言泛化方面的比较尚未被探索，因此需要系统研究这两种方法在跨语言推理泛化上的差异。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-3B-Base作为基础模型，在多种多语言推理基准（包括数学推理、常识推理和科学推理）上进行实验，比较RL和SFT的表现。

Result: 研究发现：1）RL不仅达到更高准确率，而且展现出比SFT更强的跨语言泛化能力；2）在非英语数据上进行RL训练比在英语数据上训练获得更好的整体性能和泛化能力，而SFT没有这种效果。

Conclusion: RL使模型具备更鲁棒的推理策略，为更公平有效的多语言推理提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)
attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on
cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains
unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual
reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation
model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks,
including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our
investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only
achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger
cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on
non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than
training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through
comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's
superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling
evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies,
offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在英语与非英语语言之间存在显著的性能差距，这影响了多语言企业应用的可靠性和客户体验。即使使用RAG系统，非英语语言的准确率仍比英语低29%。

Method: 采用批量对齐策略，在每个训练批次中使用语义等价的多语言数据，直接对齐不同语言的模型输出。该方法简单易实现、可扩展，并能与现有LLM训练和部署流程无缝集成。

Result: 该方法将非英语语言的准确率提升了23.9%，同时不损害英语性能、模型推理能力或检索质量。

Conclusion: 提出的批量对齐策略能够有效缩小多语言性能差距，为行业提供更稳健和公平的多语言AI解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise
applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and
mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal
reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and
operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support,
content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy
drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs,
leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to
directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves
non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance,
model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement,
scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment
pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in
industry.

TL;DR: TF-Bench是一个基于System F类型推断的基准测试，用于评估LLM的程序语义推理能力，通过去除语义无关的自然语言构建纯语义版本TF-Bench_pure，发现当前最先进LLM存在严重局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码推理基准缺乏形式化的程序中心演绎框架，无法评估模型是否真正理解程序语义而非利用自然语言与代码标记的表面关联。

Method: 基于System F类型推断构建TF-Bench基准，通过验证转换去除语义无关自然语言创建TF-Bench_pure纯语义版本，并提出两个新指标评估鲁棒性和测试时推理效果。

Result: 最先进的LLM（Claude-3.7-sonnet）在TF-Bench_pure上仅达到55.85%准确率，显示当前LLM在程序语义推理方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在程序语义推理能力上存在重大局限性，需要未来研究重点关注和改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software
engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities
show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond
mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a
formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are
incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics
or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code
tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to
as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove
semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely
semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial
limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM
(Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure.
Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the
effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in
current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future
research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied
agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet,
evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making
remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded
benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in
human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired
with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for
decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven
Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions
provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive,
reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial
and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns
and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and
multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance
improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model
limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more
robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出M-Hyper方法解决多模态知识图谱补全问题，通过四元数代数实现融合模态和独立模态的协同表示，克服现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法存在两种范式：融合方法会丢失模态特定信息且缺乏灵活性，集成方法难以捕捉模态间上下文相关的语义交互。需要同时解决这两种局限性。

Method: 使用四元数代数，四个正交基表示多个独立模态，Hamilton积建模模态间交互。包含细粒度实体表示分解模块和鲁棒关系感知模态融合模块，获得三个独立模态和一个融合模态的表示。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在性能、鲁棒性和计算效率方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: M-Hyper方法成功实现了融合和独立模态表示的共存与协作，有效解决了现有MMKGC方法的双重局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts
in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural
relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC
methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based.
Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to
the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to
varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods
retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to
capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities.
To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper,
which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent
modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both
paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining
modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize
its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and
employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among
them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation
Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF)
module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and
one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped
to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of
quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments
indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational
efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules
is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于逻辑的多模态推理评估框架，发现额外模态只有在提供独立且充分的推理路径时才能提升性能，而冗余或链式推理支持往往会损害性能。识别了任务组合瓶颈和融合瓶颈两个核心失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型虽然承诺通过整合文本、视觉和音频等不同输入来增强推理能力，但跨模态推理仍未被充分探索，且关于额外模态是否有助于或损害性能的报告存在矛盾。这些不一致源于缺乏受控评估框架和对模型内部机制的分析。

Method: 使用基于逻辑的评估框架，将多模态推理分为六种交互模式，分析事实如何在模态间分布和逻辑组合。通过注意力模式分析和两步提示（先识别后推理）等方法研究模型内部机制。

Result: 额外模态只有在提供独立且充分的推理路径时才能提升推理性能，而冗余或链式推理支持往往会损害性能。推理在三种系统方式下退化：较弱模态拖累整体性能、冲突使偏好偏向某些模态、不同模态的联合信号无法有效整合。

Conclusion: 整合而非感知是多模态推理的主要障碍，建议采用组合感知训练和早期融合控制作为有前景的方向。简单的两步提示（先识别后推理）可以恢复性能，确认了任务组合瓶颈的存在。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by
integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal
reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added
modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of
controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate
when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address
this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes
multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are
distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional
modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient
reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts
performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker
modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward
certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be
integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures:
task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly
executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces
bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode
fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason)
restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover,
modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention
in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another
failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is
the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training
and early fusion control as promising directions.

Method: 提出了基于参数重要性估计的分析框架，研究了编码器-适配器范式，并探索了分层学习率调度和低秩适配两种缓解策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，两种方法都比完全微调更好地保持了文本能力，同时提高了下游口语问答性能。

Conclusion: 分析为所提出的缓解策略有效性提供了原则性解释，将其优势与LLMs中文本知识的结构特性联系起来。

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially
expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core
textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs
to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we
analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the
widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based
on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech
introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation
of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this
insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate
scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original
parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better
maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving
downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis
offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed
mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of
textual knowledge in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有RLHF框架主要依赖偏好奖励，但忽视了模型内部知识边界，加剧了"幻觉税"问题，需要解决长文本生成中的事实性缺陷。

Method: KLCF框架关注策略模型表达知识与基础模型参数知识的一致性，引入双事实对齐机制，利用预训练知识边界构建事实检查表指导在线强化学习，同时训练基于基础模型内部知识的自评估模块。

Result: 实验结果表明KLCF在多个长文本基准测试中显著改善事实性指标，有效缓解模型幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KLCF提供了一种无需外部知识、轻量级且可扩展的方法，通过知识一致性强化学习有效提升LLM长文本生成的事实准确性。

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability
of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference
rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries,
exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we
propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a
novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy
model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and
introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall
and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to
construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve
factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module
based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision
during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or
heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and
lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training.
Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality
metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model
hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM个性化中的两个关键挑战：冷启动问题（用户历史不足）和偏见问题（用户历史丰富但偏斜），两者都源于无法建模跨用户集体知识

Method: 提出本地-全局记忆框架(LoGo)，结合个性化本地记忆和捕捉群体共享兴趣的集体全局记忆，并引入调解器模块解决两种记忆源之间的冲突

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LoGo持续提升个性化质量，既能预热冷启动用户，又能缓解偏见预测

Conclusion: 结果表明，融入集体知识对于增强LLM个性化至关重要

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to
individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its
effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start
problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for
accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with
abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences.
We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e.,
the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we
propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized
local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests
across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory
sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between
local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both
warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results
highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM
personalization.

Conclusion: 提供了对知识-预测差距的几何理解，并提出实用方法使模型行为与其潜在知识更好对齐

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form
generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction
gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that
residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important
bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the
ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes
the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that
incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states
along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned
Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention
that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the
knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice
reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA
substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While
optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as
supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its
effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new
geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical
method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense
retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model

cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach
on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the
proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy
improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出OpenBiasBench基准和Open-DeBias方法，用于检测和缓解LLMs在问答任务中的开放集偏见问题，相比现有方法在偏见缓解和泛化能力上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法局限于预定义类别，无法处理新颖或上下文特定的新兴偏见，需要解决开放集偏见检测和缓解问题。

Method: 提出Open-DeBias方法，利用适配器模块进行数据高效和参数高效的偏见缓解，能够缓解现有社会偏见和刻板印象偏见，并泛化到未见过的偏见类型。

Result: 相比最先进的BMBI方法，在BBQ数据集上模糊子集的问答准确率提升近48%，消歧子集提升6%；在零样本迁移到韩语BBQ时达到84%准确率，展现强大的语言无关泛化能力。

Conclusion: Open-DeBias方法在广泛的NLP任务中表现出鲁棒性、多语言优势和适用于通用开放领域偏见缓解的适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question
answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise
fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are
restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or
context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel
problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We
introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases
across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and
previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel,
data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter
modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing
to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias
improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and
$6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction
of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to
Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic
generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the
effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including
StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength,
and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation. The project

*Ziyi Yang,Weizhou Shen,Ruijun Chen,Chenliang Li,Fanqi Wan,Ming Yan,Xiaojun Quan,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPELL是一个多角色自玩强化学习框架，用于长上下文推理的无标注优化，通过问题生成器、回答器和验证器的循环角色实现持续自我改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理在大型语言模型中的进展滞后，主要由于处理长文本的内在困难以及缺乏可靠的人工标注和可程序验证的奖励信号。

Method: SPELL框架集成三个循环角色：问题生成器从原始文档生成问题，回答器学习基于文档解决问题，验证器评估回答与参考答案的语义等价性以产生奖励信号。采用自动化课程逐步增加文档长度，并调整问题难度以适应模型能力。

Result: 在六个长上下文基准测试中，SPELL持续提升各种LLM的性能，优于同等规模模型在大规模标注数据上的微调效果。在Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking模型上实现平均7.6分的pass@8提升。

Conclusion: SPELL展示了在无标注情况下优化长上下文推理的有效性，为扩展到更强大模型提供了前景。

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has
lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the
intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of
reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In
this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning
framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context
reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and
verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The
questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference
answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents;
and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output
and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide
continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum
that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts
question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments
on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves
performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned
on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point
gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising
its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable
models.

*Shaobo Wang,Jiaming Wang,Jiajun Zhang,Cong Wang,Yue Min,Zichen Wen,Fei Huang,Huiqiang Jiang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Q-Tuning框架，通过联合优化样本级和令牌级剪枝，在仅使用12.5%训练数据的情况下，在SmolLM2-1.7B上实现了比全数据SFT基线平均提升38%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着监督微调(SFT)计算成本增加，数据效率变得关键。现有数据剪枝方法存在设计碎片化问题，要么单独在样本级操作，要么单独在令牌级操作，无法联合优化两个维度，导致显著效率低下。

Method: 引入错误-不确定性(EU)平面诊断框架，提出象限调优(Q-Tuning)统一框架，采用两阶段策略：首先进行样本级筛选保留包含信息性误解或校准信号的样本；然后应用非对称令牌剪枝策略，使用上下文感知评分机制修剪误解样本中不太重要的令牌，同时完整保留校准样本。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。在SmolLM2-1.7B上，仅使用12.5%原始训练数据就实现了比全数据SFT基线平均提升38%的性能。

Conclusion: Q-Tuning是首个动态剪枝方法，能够持续超越全数据训练，为预算受限的LLM SFT提供了实用且可扩展的数据利用最大化蓝图。

Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step
into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency
has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight
budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they
operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to
jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant
inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while
token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals
embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the
Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes
the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by
this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework
that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning
employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain
examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it
applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring
mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples
while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new
state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B,
Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline
using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning
approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a
practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in
budget-constrained LLM SFT.

*Yibo Yan,Guangwei Xu,Xin Zou,Shuliang Liu,James Kwok,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocPruner是一个用于视觉文档检索的框架，通过自适应剪枝技术减少存储开销，能在保持检索性能的同时将存储需求降低50-60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多向量视觉文档检索方法虽然有效，但每个文档需要存储数百个向量，导致存储开销过大，难以大规模部署。

Method: 利用文档内部补丁注意力分布动态识别和丢弃冗余嵌入，实现自适应补丁级嵌入剪枝。

Result: 在十余个代表性数据集上的实验表明，DocPruner能显著减少存储需求，同时保持检索性能几乎不下降。

Conclusion: DocPruner提供了一个稳健、灵活且有效的解决方案，可用于构建存储高效的大规模视觉文档检索系统。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich
document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial
for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing
each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While
highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive
storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale
deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the
first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to
effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document
patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant
embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant
50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible
degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across
more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust,
flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale
VDR systems.

*Jingyi Yang,Guanxu Chen,Xuhao Hu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EOS Early Rejection (EOSER)和Ascending Step-Size (ASS)解码调度器，以及Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)方法，旨在解决掩码扩散语言模型(MDLMs)在解码策略和强化学习方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型(MDLMs)相比自回归模型具有并行解码、灵活生成顺序等优势，但其解码策略和强化学习算法研究不足。直接迁移自回归模型的技术存在训练-推理不一致等问题。

Method: 1) EOSER和ASS解码调度器：实现完整的扩散式解码，减少解码步骤；2) CJ-GRPO：强调rollout轨迹和优化轨迹的一致性，减少跳步优化带来的误差。

Result: 在数学和规划等推理任务上使用LLaDA-8B-Instruct进行实验，结果表明所提方法能有效且高效地驯服MDLMs。

Conclusion: EOSER、ASS机制和CJ-GRPO方法为MDLMs的有效应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as
parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer
inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored.
A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR
models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive
transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding
strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they
outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL
algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a
training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal
(parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and
the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early
Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which
unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding,
achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we
introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO)
for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory
and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by
skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks,
such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The
results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with
CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.

*Zhangdie Yuan,Zifeng Ding,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EVOLVECAST框架评估LLMs在新信息出现时是否能适当修正预测，发现LLMs的预测更新往往不一致或过于保守，置信度估计也远低于人类标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将未来事件预测视为静态任务，未考虑随着新证据出现，预测及其置信度应如何演变。

Method: 引入EVOLVECAST框架，评估LLMs在训练截止后发布的新信息面前是否修正预测，以人类预测者作为比较参考分析预测变化和置信度校准。

Result: LLMs对新信息有一定响应性，但更新往往不一致或过于保守；口头和基于logits的置信度估计均未明显优于对方，且都远低于人类标准；模型普遍表现出保守偏差。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的信念更新方法来解决LLMs在动态预测环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task,
failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as
new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework
for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their
predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses
whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released
after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative
reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated
contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their
updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that
neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently
outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard.
Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the
need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全双工交互对于自然人机通信至关重要，但现有解决方案要么依赖未开源的专用轮转检测模型，要么参数规模大或仅支持单模态，要么需要大量稀缺的全双工数据。

Method: 开发了Easy Turn模型，集成声学和语言双模态信息，预测四种对话轮转状态（完成、未完成、反馈、等待），并构建了1145小时的Easy Turn trainset训练数据集。

Result: 在开源Easy Turn测试集上，相比现有开源模型如TEN Turn Detection和Smart Turn V2，实现了最先进的轮转检测准确率。

Conclusion: Easy Turn解决了现有轮转检测模型的开源性和多模态集成问题，提供了高质量的数据集和模型，将促进全双工人机交互的发展。

Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication,
yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide
when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions
either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not
open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size
or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic.
Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex
capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain
scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an
open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and
linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete,
incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn
trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking
detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn
Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking
detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model
will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Claudio Fantinuoli*

TL;DR: 本文提出了视觉基础口译(VGI)方法，通过整合视觉语言模型处理语音和摄像头视觉输入，利用上下文视觉信息来改善机器口译中的歧义消解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器口译系统仅依赖单一语言模态，在需要视觉、情境或语用信息进行消歧和确保充分性的场景中性能受限。

Method: 构建原型系统，集成视觉语言模型处理语音和网络摄像头的视觉输入，使用手工构建的诊断语料库评估三种歧义类型。

Result: 视觉基础显著改善了词汇消歧，在性别消解方面获得适度但不稳定的提升，对句法歧义没有明显帮助。

Conclusion: 采用多模态方法是提升机器口译翻译质量的必要步骤。

Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time
speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis
of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however,
constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on
additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This
paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed
to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a
prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech
and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process
through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this
approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types
of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves
lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender
resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that
embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing
translation quality in machine interpreting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM总是生成冗长的推理轨迹效率低下，导致过多token使用和更高的推理成本，需要一种自适应推理控制方法。

Method: 结合混合数据管道(提供配对的Think-on和Think-off响应)与混合强化学习奖励系统，平衡准确性和效率，避免过度依赖详细推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，HiPO能够显著减少token长度，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: HiPO为高效自适应推理提供了原则性方法，推动了推理导向LLM在资源敏感实际场景中的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating
lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and
higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization
(i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to
selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to
respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data
pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid
reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency
while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across
mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially
reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope
HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing
the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在模拟交互式世界模型方面的核心挑战，探索文本游戏生成任务。

Method: 重构ByteSized32代码结构，创建GameBasic.py基础库，抽象出7个基类（如GameObject等）作为可复用模块，实现模块化设计。

Result: GPT-4o实验显示混合性能：在未见场景的文本游戏生成中，两个评估维度质量提升，另外两个维度下降，表明重构代码的层次结构对LLM提出了新挑战。

Conclusion: 基于基础库和模块化优化的可扩展代码结构，不仅促进LLM适应环境规范，还建立了支持未来扩展的可扩展环境。

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large
Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a
refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32
corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the
code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation
library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7
base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from
20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our
refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design,
ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of
new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and
functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of
performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen
scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation
dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical
structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we
highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation
library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to
environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that
supports future extensions.

Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法需要大量标注数据和昂贵的参数优化，导致任务特定的固化模型。PaLRS旨在提供更高效、灵活的训练免费替代方案。

Method: 从少量偏好对中提取残差流中的偏好信号，生成即插即用的转向向量，在推理时应用这些向量来引导模型行为。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中表现一致提升，同时保持基线通用性能，相比DPO对齐模型效果更好且节省大量时间。

Conclusion: PaLRS为偏好对齐提供了有效、高效且灵活的替代方案，仅需最少数据即可实现训练免费的即插即用对齐机制。

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models
(LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization
typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of
parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this
work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual
Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals
encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference
pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be
applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We
evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that
PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and
code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose
performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better
with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective,
much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference
optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for
alignment with minimal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，其计算和环境成本日益受到关注。本研究旨在探索在机器翻译任务中，如何在保持翻译质量的同时提高效率并减少环境影响。

Method: 使用Flores+基准测试和人工评估对话翻译（法语、印地语和卡纳达语），比较完整3.3B fp32模型、蒸馏模型和量化模型（包括INT4）的性能与碳排放。

Result: 完整3.3B fp32模型获得最高BLEU分数，但环境足迹最大（每次评估约0.007-0.008 kg CO2）。蒸馏模型推理速度比完整模型快4.5倍，BLEU分数仅轻微下降。即使是激进的INT4量化也能保持高准确性和流畅度。

Conclusion: 模型压缩策略能显著降低计算需求和环境影响，同时保持竞争力的翻译质量，但在低资源设置中权衡更明显。建议将效率和可持续性作为NLP进展的核心评估维度。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns
about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the
trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale,
distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We
evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of
conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of
carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model,
while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental
footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an
inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal
reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive
quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with
differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that
model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and
environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though
trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for
evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside
objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is
essential to safeguard them. We introduce a novel framework that automates the
translation of unstructured design documents into verifiable, real-time
guardrails. We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by
applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our
system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree,
which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit
agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse
applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the
critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more
regulatable AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准范围狭窄，主要关注读取密集型任务或交互深度有限的任务，无法捕捉现实工作流的复杂性和真实性。

Method: 构建包含127个高质量任务的基准，每个任务都有精心设计的初始状态和自动验证脚本，要求丰富的CRUD操作交互。使用最小化代理框架在工具调用循环中进行评估。

Result: 最佳模型gpt-5-medium仅达到52.56% pass@1和33.86% pass^4，其他强模型如claude-sonnet-4和o3低于30% pass@1和15% pass^4。LLMs平均需要16.2个执行轮次和17.4个工具调用。

Conclusion: MCPMark突显了现有LLMs在复杂现实工作流中的局限性，其压力测试性质远超先前基准，为MCP评估提供了更全面的标准。

Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the
foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow
in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction
depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows.
To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP
use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$
high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents.
Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic
script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse
interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read,
update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a
tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model,
gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other
widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below
$30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution
turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in
previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

*Yangzhou Liu,Yue Cao,Hao Li,Gen Luo,Zhe Chen,Weiyun Wang,Xiaobo Liang,Biqing Qi,Lijun Wu,Changyao Tian,Yanting Zhang,Yuqiang Li,Tong Lu,Yu Qiao,Jifeng Dai,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM)，通过Next Sequence Prediction (NSP)统一了next-token和next-block预测，能够自适应确定每个步骤的生成长度，同时保持KV缓存兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)具有理论效率优势，但受到固定长度解码和与KV缓存不兼容的限制。Block diffusion虽然缓解了这些问题，但仍强制固定块大小且需要昂贵的训练。

Method: 基于NSP提出SDLM，可以在固定大小的掩码块内执行扩散推理，但根据模型置信度动态解码连续子序列，从而保持KV缓存兼容性，并提高对不同不确定性和语义序列的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明SDLM仅使用350万训练样本就能匹配或超越强大的自回归基线，同时比Qwen-2.5实现2.1倍更高的吞吐量。SDLM-32B模型显示出更显著的效率提升。

Conclusion: SDLM展示了我们建模范式的强大可扩展性潜力，能够以最小成本改造预训练的自回归语言模型，实现高效的自适应序列生成。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are
limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV)
caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed
block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence
Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling
the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the
length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building
on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can
retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost.
Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks,
but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence,
thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying
uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM
matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training
samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the
SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating
the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm. Project page and

### [456] [SparseD: Sparse Attention for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24014)
*Zeqing Wang,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SparseD是一种针对扩散语言模型的新型稀疏注意力方法，通过一次性预计算头部特定稀疏模式并在所有步骤中重用，结合早期步骤使用全注意力、后期切换为稀疏注意力的策略，实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度下比FlashAttention快1.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源扩散语言模型存在高推理延迟问题，主要由于注意力机制的二次复杂度。虽然稀疏注意力在自回归模型中已有成功应用，但扩散语言模型表现出不同的稀疏行为特征，使得传统稀疏方法不适用。

Method: SparseD方法：1）一次性预计算头部特定稀疏模式并在所有去噪步骤中重用；2）早期步骤使用全注意力保证生成质量，后期步骤切换为稀疏注意力；3）利用扩散语言模型中注意力模式在头部间变化、在步骤间保持相似的特点。

Result: 实验结果显示SparseD实现了无损加速，在64k上下文长度和1024个去噪步骤下，比FlashAttention快1.5倍。

Conclusion: SparseD为扩散语言模型在长上下文应用中的部署提供了一个实用且高效的解决方案，成功解决了扩散语言模型特有的稀疏注意力挑战。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to
autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high
inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic
complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs.
Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict
attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections.
Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and
clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity
behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in
each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising
steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention
methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to
capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in
early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel
sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only
requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them
across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising
step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches
to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these
establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in
long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD
achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over
FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

*Hongbo Liu,Jia Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ResFormer架构，通过级联方法高效建模不同上下文长度，结合储层计算网络和Transformer，在多个数据集上显著优于基线模型，准确率提升最高达22.3%，同时减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型虽然性能优异，但存在二次时间和内存复杂度限制，难以处理长上下文。现有方法在减少计算需求方面仍有挑战。

Method: 提出ResFormer架构，采用级联方法：使用带有非线性读出的储层计算网络捕获长期上下文依赖（线性时间），同时使用传统Transformer处理固定长度的短期句子依赖。

Result: 在EmoryNLP数据集上准确率提升最高达+22.3%，在MultiWOZ、MELD和IEMOCAP数据集上表现一致优于DeepSeek-Qwen和ModernBERT基线模型，同时内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: ResFormer在建模广泛上下文信息方面展现出高效性和有效性，解决了Transformer在长序列处理中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and
categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent
detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to
quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although
extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing
extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network
architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a
cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network
featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual
dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within
sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with
fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline
models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of
up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD,
and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption,
underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual
information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于transformer集成模型和LLM的多语言情感分析方法，在缺乏标注数据的外语情感分析中取得了超过86%的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和互联网的发展，情感分析在多个行业中的重要性日益增长，但在外语特别是缺乏标注数据的情况下，传统情感分析方法存在缺陷。

Method: 使用多语言数据集，采用预训练情感分析模型集成方法，包括bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment和XLM-R模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在情感分析任务上取得了超过86%的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为外语情感分析提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在缺乏标注数据的情况下。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity
in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive,
negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the
Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous
industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment
analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly
when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present
a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs
sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset.
Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained
sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R.
Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more
than 86% using the proposed method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了大规模约束生成(LSCG)问题，评估LLMs处理大量细粒度通用约束的能力，并开发了Words Checker实例来测试模型性能，同时提出了FoCusNet模型来帮助LLM聚焦相关约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在少量特定任务约束下的生成能力，而本文旨在探索LLMs处理大规模、细粒度、通用约束列表的能力。

Method: 创建Words Checker实例评估模型特性(大小、家族)和引导技术(简单提示、思维链、最佳N)的影响，并提出FoCusNet模型将原始约束列表解析为更小子集。

Result: 实验显示现有解决方案在约束数量增加时性能显著下降，而FoCusNet能带来8-13%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: LLMs处理大规模约束时面临挑战，FoCusNet通过聚焦相关约束有效提升了性能，为大规模约束生成问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific
requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation
(LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large,
fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to
handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of
LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model
characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple
Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet,
a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a
smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments
reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the
number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

TL;DR: 提出了GEAR评估框架，用于评估大语言模型的溯因推理能力，通过一致性、泛化性和多样性三个指标自动评分，无需人工标注答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型研究主要关注指令遵循和演绎推理，但溯因推理（生成合理解释观察的假设）能力评估仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 开发GEAR评估范式，包含三个评分指标：一致性（假设解释观察）、泛化性（假设对未见输入的预测能力）、多样性（假设集的覆盖范围）。采用动量课程学习策略调整训练数据。

Result: 在4个溯因推理基准的1500个问题上测试了9个大语言模型，生成了超过5万个候选假设，揭示了传统评估方法无法发现的模型差异。无监督训练策略提升了所有GEAR目标。

Conclusion: GEAR为溯因推理提供了原则性评估框架，并提供无需标注的训练信号，帮助大语言模型产生更多样化和可靠的假设。

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on
instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can
these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We
address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible
hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for
Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and
label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics:
consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability
(consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and
diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way,
GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring
aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when
models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate
once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine
LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000
candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or
purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that
adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what
the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating
diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives.
Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and
these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken
together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and
supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more
diverse and reliable hypotheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感分析模型存在固有的社会偏见，这些偏见在现实应用中可能造成危害。传统方法构建足够覆盖领域的测试句子成本高昂，需要领域专家和众包。

Method: 使用大语言模型进行可控的测试句子生成，通过最小化规范要求来生成高质量测试用例。

Result: 实验表明，依赖大语言模型可以提供测试句子更高的语言变异性和多样性，相比基础提示方法提供更好的测试覆盖率，即使对于先前未见过的偏见也有效。

Conclusion: BTC-SAM框架能够有效生成高质量测试用例来检测情感分析模型中的社会偏见，提供更好的测试覆盖和语言多样性。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be
harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining
the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of
the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse
sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is
expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires
domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias
testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias
testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show
that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the
test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base
prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，通过利用上下文信息来弥合语用差距，显著提升大语言模型在道德推理中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在道德推理方面面临泛化挑战，因为模型擅长捕捉分布语义，而道德推理在语用层面运作，两者存在根本差异。

Method: 提出基于道德基础理论的语用推理方法，利用每一步的上下文信息来弥合语用差距，引导LLMs将道德基础与道德推理目标连接起来。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著增强了LLMs在道德推理中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来基于道德基础理论的研究提供了基础，为解决LLMs在道德推理中的泛化问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central
challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs
are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs
from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates
how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on
distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in
moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to
bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with
moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a
foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法主要关注点准确率，但忽略了改写不变性和搜索稳定性，导致提示对微小语义保持的改写非常敏感。

Method: 提出TARE框架，包含基于采样的对抗性搜索（用困难改写测试提示）和稳健选择（偏好邻域性能强的候选），以及ATARE变体学习各向异性权重来调整语义邻域。

Result: 在多样化任务上的评估表明，该方法在保持准确率的同时显著提升了提示对改写的鲁棒性，优于仅关注准确率的提示搜索方法。

Conclusion: 通过最小化文本尖锐性差距，TARE框架能够生成在语义改写下保持性能的提示，在计算上具有实用性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully
engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging
from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search,
primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance
or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in
practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically
preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this
brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we
provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete,
semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion
over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no
gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual
Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between
an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard
paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose
neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic
weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to
balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose
design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve
accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while
remaining computationally practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大推理模型的比较主要关注宏观统计数据，但不同模型是否以不同方式推理仍是一个未解问题

Method: 使用生成式语言模型比较两个LRM的推理轨迹，用文字表达它们的区别特征，然后基于经验分布建模这些特征如何预测推理轨迹的来源模型

Result: 在数学、科学和编程任务上比较12个开源LRM，LOT能识别系统性的思维差异，在区分不同规模、基础模型家族或目标领域的LRM时达到80-100%的准确率

Conclusion: LOT的自然语言分类法提供了LRM思考差异的定性解释，案例研究表明将较小模型的推理风格与最大模型对齐可提升性能

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level
statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs
reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce
the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a
generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and
articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these
features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical
distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of
reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models
think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in
math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their
thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from
LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond
classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative
explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link
the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of
smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves
their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

Motivation: 调和大型语言模型中上下文学习(ICL)机制的两个主导视角：注意力头的组件级分析和ICL的整体分解为任务识别(TR)与任务学习(TL)。

Method: 使用TSLA框架识别TR和TL注意力头，通过相关性分析、消融研究和输入扰动验证其有效性，并通过几何分析隐藏状态的转向实验揭示机制。

Result: TR头通过将隐藏状态与任务子空间对齐来促进任务识别，TL头在子空间内旋转隐藏状态朝向正确标签以促进预测，两者独立且有效地捕获ICL的TR和TL组件。

Conclusion: 该框架为大型语言模型如何在不同任务和设置中执行ICL提供了统一且可解释的说明，能够调和先前关于ICL机制的发现。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in
large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the
component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of
ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel
framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention
heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet
complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input
perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and
effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments
with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task
recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads
rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate
prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including
induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our
attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus
provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models
execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出学习任务向量(LTVs)来改进上下文学习，通过系统分析揭示了任务向量在Transformer中的工作机制：主要通过注意力头OV电路引导预测，且传播过程基本呈线性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从模型输出或隐藏状态提取任务向量通常繁琐不透明，且很少阐明任务向量如何影响计算机制。

Method: 直接训练学习任务向量(LTVs)，并通过系统分析研究任务向量在Transformer中的工作机制，包括注意力头OV电路的作用和传播特性。

Result: LTVs在准确性和灵活性上优于提取的任务向量，能够在任意层、位置甚至ICL提示中有效工作。任务向量主要通过关键注意力头的OV电路引导预测，传播过程基本呈线性。

Conclusion: LTVs不仅提供了获取有效任务向量的实用方法，还为理解上下文学习的机制基础提供了原则性视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context
demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work
suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs),
compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior
studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using
cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by
which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations.
First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass
extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively
at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through
systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that
at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV
circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level,
we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely
linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits
of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude.
Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining
effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations
of ICL.

TL;DR: RAG-GUI是一个轻量级视觉语言模型，通过在推理时利用网络教程来增强GUI代理的性能。它采用监督微调和自引导拒绝采样微调，可作为通用插件提升任何基于VLM的代理，在三个任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在真实应用中受到训练数据稀缺和任务复杂性的限制，特别是处理罕见、未见场景的长尾知识需求。

Method: 首先通过监督微调进行预热，然后通过自引导拒绝采样微调进一步优化。RAG-GUI设计为模型无关的通用插件，可在推理时利用网络教程。

Result: 在三个不同任务中持续优于基线代理，在两个模型尺寸上比其他推理基线提升2.6%至13.3%，展现出强大的泛化能力和即插即用特性。

Conclusion: RAG-GUI通过利用网络教程有效解决了GUI代理在真实场景中的长尾知识问题，证明了其作为通用插件的实用价值。

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in
automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world
applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent
complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge
covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that
leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via
supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection
sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as
a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three
distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other
inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating
strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了MedIRT框架，基于项目反应理论(IRT)来评估医学LLM，通过1100个USMLE对齐问题测试80个模型，发现模型能力存在"尖峰"特征，整体排名可能误导，并建立了实用的决策支持框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统准确率指标无法捕捉问题特征和提供主题特定见解，而LLM在医疗高风险应用中需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)，为每个主题建立单维双参数逻辑IRT模型，联合估计LLM潜在能力、问题难度和区分度，在1100个USMLE对齐问题上测试80个不同LLM。

Result: 发现模型能力呈现"尖峰"特征，GPT-5在11个领域中的8个表现最佳，但在社会科学和通信领域被Claude-3-opus超越；IRT还能识别有缺陷的问题。

Conclusion: 建立了基于心理测量学的稳健评估方法，为LLM在医疗保健中的安全有效部署提供了基础。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes
medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and
accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail
inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer
topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a
rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold
standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying
on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse
LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one
unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's
latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination,
yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone.
Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall
rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While
\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was
outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus},
demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for
specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing
benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a
practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor
competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust,
psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and
trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出PET框架，通过推断用户在稳定偏好簇上的动态概率分布来跟踪偏好演化，相比直接生成方法显著提升推荐质量并增强可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM直接生成偏好列表的方法在短期预测有效，但存在个性化受限、决策过程不透明、加剧流行度偏差等问题

Method: 使用logit-probing和生成式分类技术，将用户偏好建模为在稳定可解释偏好簇上的概率分布，实现透明偏好学习

Result: 在公开基准上NDCG提升40%，在短视频平台真实数据集上长尾内容推荐表现突出，NDCG分数比SOTA生产模型高7倍

Conclusion: PET将用户画像从直接偏好列表生成转变为透明分布偏好映射，为更可解释、公平和多样化的个性化系统铺平道路

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental
challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models
(LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability
to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common
practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating
a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction,
the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its
opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates
popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution
Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic
probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference
clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques,
PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling
transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET
improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines.
On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at
ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model
by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model
from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional
preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse
personalization systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AceSearcher是一个协作自玩框架，通过让单个LLM在分解器和求解器两个角色间切换，提升复杂推理任务的检索和推理能力，无需中间标注，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLMs在处理复杂推理任务时存在多跳检索效果不佳和推理能力有限的问题，需要更有效的框架来提升性能。

Method: 提出协作自玩框架，训练单个LLM交替扮演分解器（分解复杂查询）和求解器（整合检索上下文生成答案），结合监督微调和强化学习微调。

Result: 在10个数据集的3个推理密集型任务上平均精确匹配提升7.6%，32B版本在金融推理任务上达到DeepSeek-V3性能但参数少95%，小规模模型（1.5B/8B）性能超过参数多9倍的现有方法。

Conclusion: AceSearcher在复杂推理任务上表现出卓越的效率和效果，显著提升了搜索增强LLMs的性能，且具有优异的参数效率。

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to
ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose
AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large
language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks
down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer
generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of
search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning
optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate
annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10
datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on
document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance
of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller
scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented
LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and
effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published

TL;DR: 该论文提出语言置信度作为LLM不确定性估计的轻量级替代方案，通过构建大规模对冲表达数据集和轻量级映射器，系统研究了现代LLM的语言置信度表现，并提出了改进框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有置信度估计方法存在实用障碍：logits通常不可见、多采样计算成本高、数值化不确定性表达不符合自然交流方式。语言置信度通过自然语言中的对冲表达提供轻量级、以人为本的替代方案。

Method: 构建首个多样化、大规模的对冲表达数据集；提出轻量级映射器将对冲表达转换为置信度分数；系统研究现代LLM的语言置信度表现；引入微调框架提升语言置信度可靠性。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLM在表达可靠语言置信度方面表现不佳，但精心设计的提示方法能达到竞争性的校准和区分能力。微调框架进一步提高了语言置信度的可靠性。

Conclusion: 语言置信度是LLM不确定性估计的可扩展、高效且与人类对齐的方法，值得进一步探索这一有前景但研究不足的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation
has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face
practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally
expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score)
deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC),
where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably,
might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this
direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging
expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a
lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero
cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of
LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs
underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves
competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a
fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our
work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and
human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper
exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

TL;DR: BeyondBench是一个通过算法问题生成来评估语言模型推理能力的框架，避免了传统基准测试因训练数据污染导致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准测试存在训练数据污染问题，难以判断模型是真正推理还是仅回忆答案，因此需要一种能生成新鲜、无污染测试问题的方法。

Method: 使用算法问题生成方法，创建44个算法任务共117个变体，分为三个难度级别，每个任务从超过10^15个独特实例的组合空间中生成问题，并通过数学证明确定性验证解决方案。

Result: 评估了101个语言模型，发现所有模型家族都存在一致的推理缺陷，随着问题复杂度从多项式增加到指数级，性能急剧下降。在困难套件中，最佳模型准确率仅为56.38%。

Conclusion: BeyondBench提供了一个有效评估语言模型推理能力的方法，揭示了当前模型在复杂推理任务上的显著局限性，特别是在没有工具辅助的情况下性能大幅下降。

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks
available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it
unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this
paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this
problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks
that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh
and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of
117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks)
for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations)
for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68
variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each
task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique
instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We
evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source
models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization
schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model
families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases
from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as
Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of
56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance
drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano
showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our
leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

*Zahra Atf,Peter R Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScenarioBench是一个用于评估文本到SQL和检索增强生成的基准测试，特别关注合规场景。它通过YAML场景提供端到端评估，包括决策准确性、追踪质量、SQL正确性等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL或KILT/RAG基准测试缺乏将决策与条款级证据严格关联的机制，无法充分评估系统在合规场景下的解释质量。

Method: 使用包含预期决策、最小见证追踪、管辖条款集和规范SQL的YAML场景，要求系统使用相同政策规范中的条款ID来证明输出，使解释可证伪且适合审计。

Result: 评估器报告决策准确性、追踪质量、检索效果、SQL正确性、政策覆盖率、延迟和解释幻觉率等指标，并通过标准化场景难度指数(SDI)和预算变体(SDI-R)汇总结果。

Conclusion: 与现有基准相比，ScenarioBench在严格基础和禁止偷看规则下将每个决策与条款级证据关联，在明确时间预算下将收益转向解释质量。

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating
Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each
YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected
decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical
SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems
must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making
explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision
accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval
effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage,
latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario
Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while
accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL
or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level
evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward
justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to
empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial
difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data
available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite
of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values,
consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four
theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy
that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and
(3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice,
we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all
related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label
classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained
interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications
for the alignment of machine behavior.

the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We
employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base
model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in
the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling,
response generation with tool call results, and response generation without

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MetaTuner框架成功地将提示优化和微调相结合，展示了这两种方法的协同效应，为LLM训练提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of
LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural
language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior
work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic
potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we
introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt
optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two
neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while
allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge
sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is
optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and
parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while
fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised
regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the
baselines.

Motivation: 智能家居环境对LLM智能体提出了独特挑战，包括潜在用户意图、时间依赖、设备约束和调度等，但缺乏现实的模拟环境和评估基准。

Method: 开发了基于Matter协议的SimuHome模拟器，提供时间加速的智能家居环境，支持API调用和环境变量变化，并构建了包含600个场景的12种用户查询类型基准。

Result: 评估11个智能体发现，虽然简单任务表现良好，但在潜在意图推断、状态验证和时间调度方面存在困难，即使是表现最好的GPT-4.1也只有54%的成功率。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够可靠验证当前状态并通过工具协调时间相关行动的方法，以提升智能家居智能体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks.
However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle
latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and
more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such
capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where
agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a
challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart
devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.
By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard
for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment,
and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant
devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600
episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned
capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework
reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with
latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal
scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success
rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably
verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent
actions.

Method: 提出GIRCSE框架，利用自回归生成迭代优化语义表示，通过产生在对比目标下优化的软标记序列来捕捉潜在概念和隐含语义。采用迭代对比优化目标指导优化过程。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试和指令跟随任务中超越了强大的LLM嵌入基线。GIRCSE展现出测试时扩展特性：推理时生成更多token能持续提升嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 生成式迭代优化为表示学习建立了新范式。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an
emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference
steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative
refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扎根理论依赖专家手动编码，存在可扩展性瓶颈。现有计算工具无法实现真正自动化，研究人员仍需参与循环。

Method: 集成LLM驱动编码、语义聚类、图推理和迭代精炼过程，构建高度可重用的编码本。引入5维指标和训练-测试分割协议进行标准化评估。

Conclusion: LOGOS展示了在不牺牲理论细微差别的情况下，民主化和扩展定性研究的强大新途径。

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance
on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck.
Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers
firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that
fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a
structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic
clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build
highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a
principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for
standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS
consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$
alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS
demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research
without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)在越狱攻击中的脆弱性，揭示了贪婪重掩码策略的有害偏见和去噪路径依赖现象，并提出了DiffuGuard防御框架，通过随机退火重掩码和块级审计修复显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的迭代和并行生成机制带来了与自回归LLMs根本不同的安全漏洞，需要深入分析其脆弱性并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 从两个维度分析dLLM漏洞：步内动态和步间动态；提出DiffuGuard防御框架，包含随机退火重掩码(动态引入受控随机性)和块级审计修复(利用内部表示进行风险检测和引导修正)。

Result: 实验显示DiffuGuard在四个dLLM上表现优异，将六种不同越狱方法的攻击成功率从47.9%降至14.7%，同时保持了模型效用和效率。

Conclusion: 当前解码策略构成显著漏洞，但dLLMs具有巨大的内在安全潜力；DiffuGuard通过训练免费的双阶段方法有效解锁了这一潜力，为dLLM安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces
unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from
Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation
mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM
vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step
and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in
the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we
term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens
decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while
current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs
possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we
propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses
vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking
dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias,
while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for
autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on
four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack
Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while
preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量多模态基准对推进大模型科学推理至关重要，但人工创建成本高且不可扩展，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发TQA-to-MMQA转换框架，建立多维度质量评估标准，构建两个基准数据集，并设计Q-Mirror代理系统集成生成与评估形成闭环优化。

Result: 实验显示现有模型能生成MMQAs但质量仍有差距，顶级理解模型在质量评估上与人类判断一致，Q-Mirror将平均分从78.90提升至85.22，通过率从72%提升至95%。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模科学基准构建提供了实用路径，通过自动化转换和迭代优化显著提升了基准质量和构建效率。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific
reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable.
To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only
QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include
three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA
framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric
that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction:
Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate
state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of
MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop
an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by
integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative
refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can
generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the
need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier
understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality
assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores
from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path
to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs价值观表达的两种方式（内在表达和提示引导表达）的底层机制差异，这对价值观对齐和角色引导应用至关重要。

Method: 使用两种方法分析机制：(1) 价值向量 - 从残差流中提取代表价值机制的特征方向；(2) 价值神经元 - 识别对价值表达有贡献的MLP神经元。

Result: 内在和提示引导的价值机制部分共享诱导价值表达的关键组件，但也各有独特元素。提示引导机制具有更高的可操控性，而内在机制产生更多样化的响应。

Conclusion: 两种价值表达机制既有共享组件又有独特元素，提示引导机制更易操控但内在机制产生更丰富的响应多样性，独特组件在不同任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct
ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned
during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts.
Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is
paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly
whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially
different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at
the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature
directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream,
and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We
demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common
components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess
unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms
lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and
response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to
the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas
those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction
following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in
language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general
intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and
cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged,
integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to
enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science,
multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing
frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the
field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To
address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs
for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets,
and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline
future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative
reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the
intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The

TL;DR: 提出Speculative Verification (SV)方法，通过动态预测推测准确率并调整验证长度来优化推测解码，在保持兼容性的同时显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在推测准确率低时，因拒绝令牌的开销会抵消其优势，特别是在大批量处理时效率受限。

Method: 引入一个与草稿模型大小相似的伴侣模型来估计草稿模型与目标模型分布的对齐程度，动态调整验证长度以减少浪费计算。

Result: 在9种模型组合和多种批量大小(4-80)的广泛评估中，SV始终优于传统推测解码和目标模型标准解码，在大批量设置中平均加速1.4倍，最高提升2倍性能。

Conclusion: SV方法展现了鲁棒性、可扩展性和实际效用，为高效LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding.
Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to
speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by
a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from
rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness,
especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative
Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts
speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput.
SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to
the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model
distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this
alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on
rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no
modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD
variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three
NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models,
including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no
finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and
batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding
with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an
average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80).
These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility
for efficient LLM inference.

TL;DR: AlignX是一个两阶段的表示级框架，通过多语言语义对齐和指令微调来提升预训练大语言模型的多语言性能，特别是在非主导语言上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在非主导语言上的性能和跨语言对齐能力往往不足，现有的大规模多语言语料微调方法存在对齐不精确和知识转移效果有限的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过多语言语义对齐和语言特征整合来对齐多语言表示；第二阶段通过多语言指令微调来激发LLMs的多语言能力。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法增强了LLMs的多语言通用能力和跨语言生成能力，使多语言表示更加接近并改善了跨语言对齐。

Conclusion: AlignX框架有效缩小了多语言性能差距，为提升预训练LLMs在多语言任务上的表现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual
understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and
cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution
is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but
such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge
transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper,
we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a
two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance
of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations
with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the
second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual
instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs
demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and
cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX
brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual
alignment.

TL;DR: 研究在数据受限环境下语言模型预训练的数据调度策略，探讨文本简化作为数据增强方法以及按复杂度排序的课程学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数语言模型预训练研究关注大数据集，但在数据受限环境下，训练数据顺序和包含同一文本的不同版本的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用包含人类撰写段落与LLM简化变体的平行语料库，测试四种数据调度策略：重复暴露、从低到高复杂度、从高到低、交错排列。通过微调和零样本性能评估表示质量。

Result: 添加简化数据相比重复暴露基线能提升微调和零样本性能：较小模型受益于从低到高复杂度排序，较大模型在交错排序下表现更好。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的预训练中，文本简化作为数据增强方法有效，且最优数据调度策略取决于模型规模。

Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving
open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such
settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative
versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying
curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and
data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts
enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2)
Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer,
we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are
aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated
exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze
models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via
fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge,
entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show
that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over
a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high
complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型开发流程只有预训练和后训练两个阶段，缺乏中间阶段来进一步提升性能。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过强化中训练实现更强的性能增益。

Method: 提出RMT框架，包含三个核心组件：动态令牌预算机制限制不必要推理步骤；课程自适应采样方法实现从易到难的渐进学习；双训练策略结合强化学习和下一令牌预测。

Result: 实验表明RMT优于现有方法，在语言建模中性能提升高达64.91%，推理长度仅需21%。强化中训练获得的检查点还能使后续后训练在数学领域提升18.76%。

Conclusion: 强化中训练是大语言模型开发的重要补充阶段，RMT框架通过高效、自适应和统一的训练方法显著提升模型性能，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly
understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We
point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement
mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we
formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient
training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced
token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To
address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive,
and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In
particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains
unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a
curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning
trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training
strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction,
ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with
only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that
checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the
subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the
mathematical domain.

Conclusion: HarmMetric Eval为有害性度量和评判器提供了全面评估框架，揭示了传统指标在特定任务中的优势，有助于提高LLM安全评估的可信度。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to
elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak
attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the
harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark
to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines
the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To
address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness
metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of
representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful
model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various
metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a
surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform
LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging
prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval,

Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately
20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly
reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while
activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation
reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion
language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language
models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The
instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities
comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation,
mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active
parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into
the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out
MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens
ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind
human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that
explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's
internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL,
a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance.
Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that
synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via
RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative
Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament
Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy
adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive

Result: 最先进LLM（如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1）仅达到4%执行准确率，而协作代理方法将准确率提升至15%，相比MultiSpider 1.0的60%准确率存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了显著的多语言差距，需要开发跨语言鲁棒的方法以适应真实企业部署需求。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are
English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0,
extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's
structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability,
demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art
LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when
relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we
provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively
refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial
multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and
ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at

*Haosi Mo,Xinyu Ma,Xuebo Liu,Derek F. Wong,Yu Li,Jie Liu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CDT框架，从认知、领域、任务三个维度全面评估大语言模型能力，基于Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论扩展能力定义，应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择，实验显示能有效提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型评估基准往往关注孤立能力，缺乏全面评估框架，需要更全面的能力评估方法来弥补这一空白。

Method: 提出Cognition-Domain-Task（CDT）框架，结合Cattell-Horn-Carroll认知理论，从三个维度定义模型能力，并应用于数据集能力评估和数据选择。

Result: 实验表明能力指标与下游性能相关性良好，在数据选择实验中，通用和特定基准分别达到44.3和45.4分，比基线提高1.6和2.2分。

Conclusion: CDT框架有效且实用，能够支持有效的数据集分析和构建，验证了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation
frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing
benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for
assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the
Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's
capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability
definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll
cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply
CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection.
Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream
performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The
experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both
general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an
increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results
validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are
available at https://github.com/Alessa-mo/CDT.

*Charlie Wyatt,Aditya Joshi,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该调查论文系统梳理了替代Next Token Prediction(NTP)范式的五种主要方法，旨在解决LLM在长期规划、错误累积和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTP范式虽然推动了LLM的成功，但也导致了长期规划能力差、错误累积和计算效率低等持续性问题，需要探索替代方案。

Method: 将替代方法分为五类：多令牌预测、先规划后生成、潜在推理、连续生成方法、非Transformer架构。

Result: 建立了一个分类体系来指导研究，帮助开发解决令牌级生成局限性的新型NLP模型。

Conclusion: 通过系统分类替代NTP的方法，为开发具有更强规划能力和计算效率的下一代语言模型提供了研究框架。

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented
success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most
persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and
computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring
alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of
alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families:
(1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a
single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created
upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the
autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous
Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative,
parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods;
and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their
inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this
survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known
limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for
natural language processing.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOBACO是一个日语基准测试，用于评估LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，发现去偏见方法会显著降低文化常识任务性能（最高75%准确率下降）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏见方法主要评估对通用语言理解的影响，但文化常识与社会偏见密切相关，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出SOBACO基准测试，以统一格式评估LLMs的社会偏见和文化常识，并测试多种去偏见方法的影响。

Result: 去偏见方法显著降低了LLMs在文化常识任务上的性能，最高导致75%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: 开发去偏见方法时需要考虑与文化常识的权衡，以提升LLMs的公平性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development
of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the
capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias
mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding,
which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense
is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and
values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not
been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs
and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate
social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate
several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural
commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the
performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy
deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing
methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve
fairness and utility of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态规划和波束搜索的新型对齐算法，相比传统方法能更精确地识别语音识别中的个体错误，支持细粒度错误分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在语音识别基准测试中表现优异，但主要改进来自高频词，而罕见词、命名实体和领域特定词汇的错误更具实际影响，但被聚合指标掩盖。传统对齐方法无法满足精确错误分析的需求。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的对齐算法，将动态规划与波束搜索评分相结合，旨在提供比传统文本对齐方法更准确的个体错误对齐。

Result: 与传统的文本对齐方法相比，该方法能够更准确地对齐个体错误，从而实现可靠的错误分析。

Conclusion: 该算法通过PyPI提供，为语音识别系统的细粒度错误分析提供了更精确的对齐工具。

Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech
recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with
limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error
rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and
domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by
aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis,
which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts.
However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We
propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam
search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach
provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error
analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Sanitize框架，通过模拟人类自我监控和自我修复行为，在token级别实时检测和修正大语言模型生成的有害内容，特别是隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全对齐方法主要基于后处理过滤，这会引入显著延迟和计算开销，且不兼容token级流式生成。需要一种实时、低开销的解决方案来防止有害内容生成。

Method: Self-Sanitize包含两个模块：Self-Monitor通过表示工程在token级别持续监控高层意图；Self-Repair对有害内容进行原位修正，无需启动单独的审查对话。

Result: 在四个大语言模型和三种隐私泄露场景下的实验表明，Self-Sanitize实现了优异的缓解性能，具有最小开销且不影响模型实用性。

Conclusion: Self-Sanitize为更安全的大语言模型部署提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，支持实时流式监控和无缝修复。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: GRPO-MA通过为每个思维过程生成多个答案来解决GRPO算法中的梯度耦合、稀疏奖励和不稳定优势估计问题，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析GRPO算法在训练思维链推理时面临的三个挑战：思维与答案间的梯度耦合、有限并行采样导致的稀疏奖励信号、以及不稳定的优势估计。

Method: 提出GRPO-MA方法，通过为每个思维过程生成多个答案，利用多答案生成实现更鲁棒和高效的优化，理论上证明思维优势的方差随每个思维的答案数量增加而减小。

Result: 梯度分析证实GRPO-MA减少了梯度尖峰，在数学、代码和多样化多模态任务上的实验表明GRPO-MA显著提升了性能和训练效率。

Conclusion: 消融研究进一步揭示增加每个思维的答案数量能持续提升模型性能，GRPO-MA为思维链推理训练提供了更有效的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling
between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel
sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages
multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and
efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought
advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases.
Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA
reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and
diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves
performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that
increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model
performance.

TL;DR: SUIT方法通过识别和修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，显著改善了知识编辑中的知识保留能力，同时保持高编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识编辑方法在修改MLP层时对关键向量和值向量没有约束，导致对编辑模型产生显著扰动。

Method: 提出SUIT方法，识别并仅修改与编辑相关的关键特征子空间，而不是整个MLP层。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B、GPT-J-6B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，SUIT在保持高编辑效果的同时，显著提升了知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SUIT成功识别了编辑的关键子空间，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language
Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by
finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector
(value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing
methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant
perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace
Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace
of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B,
GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge
preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This
effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace
for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach.
The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估缺乏对终端用户现实生活的关注，特别是在医疗等关键领域需要反映社区日常需求、文化实践和细微背景的评估方法。

Method: 与民间组织和社区成员共同创建社区驱动评估管道，通过社区反馈确定评估内容、构建基准和评分标准，实现可扩展的自动化基准测试。

Result: 展示了当前多语言LLM处理细微社区健康查询的能力，同时提供了上下文接地和包容性LLM评估的可扩展路径。

Conclusion: Samiksha方法为LLM评估提供了文化感知、社区驱动的创新路径，能够更好地反映真实用户需求和背景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or
domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in
the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require
evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the
everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We
propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with
civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables
scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven
pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the
benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in
the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual
LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable
pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

TL;DR: AdaThink-Med是一个端到端框架，通过不确定性引导的长度校准增强医疗LLMs的自适应思维能力，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗LLMs对所有问题都进行冗长推理，导致实际应用中的推理成本增加。需要让模型对简单问题少思考、复杂问题多思考的自适应思维能力。

Method: 生成多个候选输出，评估每个候选的正确性和不确定性，通过不确定性引导的长度校准模块估计问题难度，对低难度正确输出惩罚较长推理路径，对高难度错误输出鼓励扩展思维链。

Result: 在六个公共医疗QA基准测试中，平均实现6.4倍长度减少，性能仅轻微下降。模型自发发展出"不思考"和"思考"两种推理模式。

Conclusion: AdaThink-Med有效提升了医疗LLMs的自适应推理能力，在性能和计算成本之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought
have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and
medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in
lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question,
leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore,
enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and
think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs
in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches
designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while
providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and
computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first
end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical
reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first
generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the
correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem
difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs
with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer
reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers,
it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions.
On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length
reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation.
Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct
reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking",
demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes
dynamically.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究阅读障碍的方法在检验因果关系方面存在局限，需要一种能够测试阅读障碍潜在机制因果假设的计算框架。

Method: 在视觉语言模型中识别视觉词汇形式选择性单元，并对其进行针对性消融，同时保持随机单元不变作为对照。

Result: 针对性消融词汇处理单元会导致阅读任务选择性受损，而一般视觉和语言理解能力保持完整，这与阅读障碍患者的语音缺陷模式一致。

Conclusion: 该计算模型成功复制了阅读障碍的关键特征，为研究阅读障碍建立了一个有效的计算框架。

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits
without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our
modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a
computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

Motivation: 尽管多语言自动语音识别（ASR）有所进展，但语码转换（CS）——日常语音中常见的语言混合现象——仍然是一个严重未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 构建HiKE基准框架，包含高质量自然语码转换数据、借词标签和分层语码转换级别标注（词级、短语级、句子级），并通过多种多语言ASR模型评估和微调实验进行验证。

Result: 评估表明，大多数多语言ASR模型最初在CS-ASR方面表现不佳，但通过使用CS数据进行微调可以显著提升这一能力。

Conclusion: HiKE为韩英语码转换提供了首个全球可访问的评估框架，能够系统评估模型处理不同级别语码转换的能力，并通过实验证明微调可以有效提升模型在语码转换任务上的表现。

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR),
code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in
daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we
introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the
first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to
provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to
foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of
high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides
meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word,
phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's
ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of
diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper
demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with
CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE

Method: 制定形式化的夸大宣传语言识别指南，在NIH基金申请语料上进行标注，评估传统文本分类器和语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该任务具有语言复杂性，可能需要领域知识和时间意识。这是首次将夸大宣传检测作为自然语言处理任务进行研究。

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine
objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust
in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of
hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to
glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We
propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to
annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application
corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on
this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments
show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate
candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine
learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic
complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and
temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype
detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a
natural language processing task.

TL;DR: InfLLM-V2是一个可训练的稀疏注意力框架，通过参数复用实现从短序列到长序列的无缝切换，在保持性能的同时实现4倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时面临计算和内存瓶颈，而现有的可训练稀疏注意力方法引入过多额外参数并破坏预训练-微调流程。

Method: 提出密集-稀疏可切换注意力框架，通过无参数架构修改复用密集注意力参数，短序列使用密集注意力，长序列平滑切换到稀疏注意力。

Result: 实验表明InfLLM-V2比密集注意力快4倍，在长上下文理解和思维链推理任务中分别保持98.1%和99.7%的性能。

Conclusion: InfLLM-V2提供了一种实用的长序列处理解决方案，并基于此框架训练开源了MiniCPM4.1混合推理模型。

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language
models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer
architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing
long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising
solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters
and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}
workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention
framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that
seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2
reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture
modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence
processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all
sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly
transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical
acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2
that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on
long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that
InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and
99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we
have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1
(https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model,
providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了unPact框架，通过提示归因和贡献跟踪来可解释地分析遗忘机制，发现现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么知识仍可通过关键词强调恢复，要么因灾难性遗忘导致通用性能崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的遗忘方法有效性存在争议，一方面被遗忘的知识可通过微调恢复，另一方面遗忘可能引发灾难性遗忘。由于难以追踪LLMs复杂架构中的知识，缺乏对遗忘机制的可解释性分析。

Method: 提出unPact框架，量化提示中每个标记对输出的影响，通过遗忘前后的比较揭示变化。在6种主流遗忘方法、3种LLM和3个基准测试上进行评估。

Result: (1)遗忘通过干扰对提示关键词的关注而显得有效；(2)大部分知识并未真正擦除，仅通过强调提示中的关键词即可恢复，无需修改模型权重；(3)灾难性遗忘源于对所有标记的无差别惩罚。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘方法存在两难困境：要么不足（知识仍可恢复），要么过度破坏（通用性能崩溃），距离可靠的遗忘仍有差距。

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models
(LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten"
knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light
fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting
that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning
methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the
difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this
gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt
attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt
token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to
reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and
three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by
disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly
erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts,
without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from
indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest
an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient -
knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive -
general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a
gap to reliable unlearning.

*Leander Girrbach,Chi-Ping Su,Tankred Saanum,Richard Socher,Eric Schulz,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现单次LLM作为无参考评估者的评分不可靠，存在不稳定性和校准问题，提出了基于内部模型信号的潜在评估方法，在多种基准测试中表现优于标准提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单次LLM作为无参考评估者的评分可靠性问题，发现评分在采样下不稳定且校准不佳，导致评分压缩和频繁平局。

Method: 提出潜在评估方法，包括：(i)基于整数评分的概率加权分数，(ii)验证器式的"是"概率，(iii)在评分位置训练线性探针。

Result: 在广泛的成对和单评分基准测试中，潜在方法匹配或超越标准提示方法，在成对准确性和列表排序方面有持续提升。概率加权分数实现最强的单评分相关性，而探针在输出逻辑校准不佳时恢复有用信号。

Conclusion: 潜在信息为无参考评估提供确定性和更具区分度的信号，可以改进选择和训练方法如Best-of-N、多教师蒸馏和路由。

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references,
and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study
the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to
free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under
sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the
scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which
derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted
scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and
(iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across
a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or
surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and
listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores
achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful
signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that
latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for
reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches
like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

TL;DR: 提出了MemGen动态生成式记忆框架，通过记忆触发器和记忆编织器实现推理与记忆的紧密交织，在8个基准测试中显著超越现有外部记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆范式存在局限：参数化记忆强制调整模型参数，检索式记忆将经验外部化到结构化数据库中，但都无法捕捉人类认知中推理与记忆的流动交织。

Method: MemGen包含记忆触发器（监控代理推理状态决定显式记忆调用）和记忆编织器（以当前状态为刺激构建潜在token序列作为机器原生记忆来丰富推理）。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，MemGen比ExpeL和AWM等领先外部记忆系统提升高达38.22%，超过GRPO达13.44%，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MemGen无需显式监督即可自发演化出类似人类的记忆能力，包括规划记忆、程序性记忆和工作记忆，表明机器认知向更自然形式发展的新兴轨迹。

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to
the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment
interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly
adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience
into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of
reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we
propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a
human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which
monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and
a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to
construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its
reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent
memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and
cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen
surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to
$38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit
supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties,
including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an
emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

TL;DR: Socratic-Zero是一个完全自主的框架，通过三个智能体（教师、求解器、生成器）的协同进化，从少量种子示例生成高质量训练数据，无需现有任务或标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据合成方法在数据质量不一致和无法动态适应模型能力演变方面的局限性，减少对大规模人工标注数据的依赖。

Method: 采用三个智能体协同进化：求解器从成功和失败轨迹中学习偏好反馈来优化推理；教师根据求解器的弱点自适应地设计更具挑战性的问题；生成器提炼教师的问题设计策略以实现可扩展的课程生成。

Result: 仅从100个种子问题开始，Socratic-Solver-8B在七个数学推理基准测试中比先前数据合成方法平均提升20.2个百分点；Socratic-Generator-32B的合成数据使学生LLM在这些基准测试中超越其他最先进的商业LLM。

Conclusion: Socratic-Zero框架通过完全自主的数据生成和课程学习，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力，证明了无需大量人工标注即可实现卓越性能的可能性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely
heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus
difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising
alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an
inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model,
leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we
introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution
of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver
continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both
successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly
challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator
distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable,
high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a
self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels.
Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B
achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis
methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25,
Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3
and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from
Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks,
including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4,

TL;DR: ProxyAttn是一种训练免费的稀疏注意力算法，通过压缩注意力头维度实现更精确的块重要性估计，在保持性能的同时显著加速LLM的长文本处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态块重要性估计方法在稀疏率较高时会导致性能下降，需要更精细的估计方法来平衡效率和性能。

Method: 利用注意力头之间的相似性，使用代表性代理头的分数来近似所有头的分数，并结合块感知动态预算估计方法实现细粒度块重要性评估。

Result: 在多种主流模型和基准测试中验证了注意力头之间的相似性，ProxyAttn实现了高达10.3倍的注意力加速和2.4倍的预填充加速，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: ProxyAttn通过精细化的块重要性估计，在低计算成本下实现了性能和效率的显著提升，为长文本任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that
dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse
attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of
LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance
degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a
training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block
estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our
observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores
of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To
account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware
dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative
proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained
block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety
of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity
among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed
method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to
existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention
acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance
loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

TL;DR: LatentEvolve是一个自进化的潜在测试时缩放框架，通过模拟人脑互补学习系统的昼夜交替过程，让LLM学习如何更有效地进行测试时计算缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法相互独立，LLM尚未学会如何渐进式地更有效地进行缩放。目标是让LLM学习"如何缩放测试时计算"。

Method: 受互补学习系统理论启发，包含两个进化组件：白天缩放（快速检索历史潜在表示指导推理）和夜间缩放（整合过去潜在优化，类似人脑睡眠中的经验巩固）。

Result: 在8个基准测试和5个模型骨干上的实验表明，LatentEvolve比最先进的TTS方法（如LatentSeek和TTRL）性能提升高达13.33%，并展现出卓越的跨域和跨骨干泛化能力。

Conclusion: 昼夜交替过程实现了LLM测试时缩放的快速和慢速进化，模拟了人类认知动态，在完全无监督的方式下显著提升了推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference
phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are
largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively
learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to
learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a
self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning
system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a
fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve
comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly
retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM
reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent
optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of
experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes
facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive
dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses
state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and
exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

TL;DR: SeaPO是一种战略错误放大方法，通过在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，确保负样本比正样本更具错误性，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法在偏好优化中，由于模型评分或生成能力的限制，正负样本质量可能相似，这给偏好学习优化带来困难。

Method: 利用LLM中常见的三种错误类型，在模型偏好优化中引入特定错误模式，通过偏好训练来减少这些错误的发生。

Result: 在五个能力维度和不同模型规模（1.5B到14B）上的评估显示，生成的数据显著提升了整体模型性能，真实性方面提升了5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: 任务性能取决于引入的错误类型：注入最常见错误类型可提升相关任务性能，混合错误类型则带来更广泛的性能提升，大多数任务稳定改进，少数任务显著提升。

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language
models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive
and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring
or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may
become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference
learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error
Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in
LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference
Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous
than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the
occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations
across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B)
demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model
performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10
percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance
varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error
types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads
to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements,
while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本相似度指标（如BLEU、BERT）无法有效评估组装指令的时空合理性，需要开发能更好反映构建过程时空特性的评估方法。

Method: 开发了一种基于树结构的自动评估指标，特别针对缝纫指令领域，通过树形结构捕捉指令的时空关系。

Result: 新指标与人工标注的错误计数和人类质量评分相关性更好，且在专门设计用于混淆文本相似度指标的对抗样本上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的树基评估指标在评估缝纫指令的时空合理性方面优于传统文本相似度指标，具有更好的相关性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for
LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects
spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU
and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of
sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with
manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating
our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing
instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than
traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples
that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual
similarity.

TL;DR: KnowGuard是一个新颖的"调查-再弃权"范式，通过系统性的知识图谱探索来改进临床决策中的弃权机制，提高诊断准确性并减少不必要的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床实践中，医生在患者信息不足时会选择弃权以避免误诊，但现有大型语言模型缺乏有效的弃权机制，经常在信息不完整时给出过度自信的回答。

Method: 提出KnowGuard方法，包含两个关键阶段：1)证据发现阶段通过图谱扩展和直接检索系统探索医学知识空间；2)证据评估阶段使用多因素对证据进行排序，根据患者上下文和对话历史调整探索策略。

Result: 在开放式多轮临床基准测试中，KnowGuard优于最先进的弃权方法，诊断准确率提高3.93%，平均减少7.27次不必要的交互。

Conclusion: KnowGuard通过系统性的知识图谱探索实现了有效的临床决策弃权机制，显著提升了诊断准确性和交互效率。

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient
information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical
safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent
investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in
medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions,
frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information.
This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on
model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge
boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose
\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that
integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making.
Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized
evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the
medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an
evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt
exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage
approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to
trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence.
We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical
benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention
quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form
evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard
outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic
accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on
average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知诊断模型无法有效处理动态、非结构化的师生对话，且难以从冗长对话中准确提取诊断语义。

Method: 采用教育理论中的IRE（发起-回应-评价）框架设计对话诊断框架，并开发基于图的编码方法整合教师问题和相关知识组件。

Result: 在三个真实对话数据集上的实验表明，DiaCDM显著提高了诊断准确性，并增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: DiaCDM为教师评估学生认知状态提供了有力工具，是对话场景中认知诊断的首个探索。

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge
mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student
dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a
suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's
difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To
overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted
the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to
design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique
graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant
knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our
knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue
setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM
not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the
results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for
assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemShareKV是一个基于语义相似性的KV缓存共享框架，通过模糊令牌匹配和位置编码优化，在语义相似但词汇不同的提示词之间重用KV缓存，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模扩大，推理过程中KV缓存的内存占用成为瓶颈。现有方法主要针对单个提示词内压缩或重用共享前缀，但在语义相似但词汇不同的场景中效果有限。

Method: 使用局部敏感哈希(LSH)进行令牌嵌入的模糊匹配，结合旋转位置编码(RoPE)保持位置信息，从参考提示词的缓存中有选择地重用相关键值对。

Result: 在多样化摘要数据集上，对5k令牌输入实现了6.25倍加速和42%的GPU内存降低，质量损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 语义感知的缓存共享在高效LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力，特别是在多文档摘要和对话代理等任务中。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of
key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck.
Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single
prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across
prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are
semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks
such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose
\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that
accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts.
Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token
matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and
incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional
information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference
prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining
output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to
6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with
negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of
semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳，在医疗编码任务中仅达到45.9%准确率，需要解决领域特定的AI局限性。

Method: 分析四个专业领域的错误模式，发现错误遵循分层结构：知识层（58.4%）、推理层（39.6%）和复杂度层（2.0%）。基于此开发三阶段校正框架，按错误层次重要性进行处理。

Result: 在医疗转录、法律文档分类、政治偏见检测和法律推理等任务中验证，跨五个LLM架构平均提升11.2个百分点（p < 0.001）。但在高基线任务（>75%准确率）中框架效果有限。

Conclusion: 系统错误分析可指导专业领域AI增强策略，特别适用于中等基线任务，同时需要理解框架边界以实现最优部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized
domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical
coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC)
framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic
error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI
errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors
(58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%).
Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that
addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates
that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task
performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal
document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases),
and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model
validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of
11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework
limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical
intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI
enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for
moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding
framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在心理健康危机检测和响应方面的能力，发现虽然LLMs在处理明确危机披露时表现一致可靠，但在处理间接风险信号时存在系统性弱点，且存在不当或有害响应的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT和Llama等LLM聊天机器人在高风险心理健康支持场景中的广泛应用，需要了解它们安全检测和响应急性心理健康危机的能力，但目前缺乏统一的危机分类法、标注基准和基于临床最佳实践的实证评估。

Method: 引入六个临床心理健康危机类别的统一分类法，策划多样化评估数据集，建立专家设计的响应适当性评估协议，系统性地对三个最先进的LLM进行危机分类和生成安全适当响应的基准测试。

Result: LLMs在处理明确危机披露时高度一致且总体可靠，但相当比例（不可忽视）的响应被评为不适当或有害，开源模型的失败率高于商业模型。在处理间接或模糊风险信号时存在系统性弱点，依赖公式化回复，且经常与用户情境不匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM部署中迫切需要增强安全保障、改进危机检测和情境感知干预。该分类法、数据集和评估框架为AI驱动的心理健康支持领域的持续研究和负责任创新奠定了基础，有助于最小化伤害并更好地保护弱势用户。

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such
as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and
advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in
high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns.
While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and
respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is
hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated
benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In
this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six
clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse
evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing
response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art
LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate
responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and
generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks
remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or
harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher
failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify
systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance
on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with
user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced
safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM
deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the
groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental
health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用大语言模型自动识别文本中的隐喻，比较了检索增强生成、提示工程和微调三种方法，发现微调方法能达到0.79的中位F1分数，表明LLM可以部分自动化隐喻识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻是话语的普遍特征，但大规模分析受到手动标注的限制，因为隐喻具有语境敏感性。本研究旨在利用大语言模型自动化隐喻识别。

Method: 比较三种方法：(i)检索增强生成(RAG)，提供代码书和示例；(ii)提示工程，包括零样本、少样本和思维链策略；(iii)微调，在人工标注文本上训练模型。

Result: 最先进的闭源LLM能达到高准确率，微调方法的中位F1分数为0.79。人类与LLM输出的差异大多是系统性的，反映了隐喻理论中的灰色地带和概念挑战。

Conclusion: LLM可以至少部分自动化隐喻识别，并可作为开发和改进隐喻识别协议及其理论基础的工具。

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for
examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has
been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive
nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare
three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is
provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules
and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal
instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded
texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot,
few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that
state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning
yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs
reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey
areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be
used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a
testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the
theory that underpins them.

*Yoonna Jang,Kisu Yang,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明语言模型可以在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，提升问题解决能力，特别是对小模型效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在推理阶段利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，而不需要训练特殊标记。

Method: 识别有效的标记类型、数量和插入位置，研究模型何时开始利用扩展计算空间，并通过注意力图分析空间内的动态。在1.7B到32B模型上进行开放域问答和数学任务实验。

Result: 适当的标记类型和数量因模型而异，但将填充标记直接放在最终'Answer:'标记前最有效。小模型受益最大（SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct提升12.372个百分点），表明这些空间是额外计算能力而非冗余输入。注意力图显示扩展空间通常延续原始注意力机制，有时聚焦于问题或答案选项。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以在推理阶段有效利用人工插入的填充标记序列作为额外计算空间，特别是对小模型效果显著，这些空间确实用于有意义的计算而非冗余处理。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional
task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed
reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer
inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional
computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can
leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference.
We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then
examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded
computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via
attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across
open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts
vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is
most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in
SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional
computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that
expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes
focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for
problem-solving.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BOE-XSUM数据集，包含3648个西班牙官方公报文档的简明摘要，并证明在该数据集上微调的中等规模LLM在摘要任务上显著优于零样本通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于信息过载，长文档摘要能力日益重要，但西班牙语文档特别是法律领域缺乏此类摘要资源。

Method: 构建BOE-XSUM数据集，包含原始文本、简明摘要和文档类型标签；在数据集上微调中等规模LLM，并与零样本通用模型进行对比。

Result: 微调模型显著优于非专用模型，最佳模型BERTIN GPT-J 6B比最佳零样本模型DeepSeek-R1性能提升24%（准确率41.6% vs 33.5%）。

Conclusion: 领域专用的微调模型在法律文档摘要任务上表现优于通用模型，证明了BOE-XSUM数据集的有效性和领域适应的重要性。

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important
in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such
summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in
particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising
3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's
``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each
entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its
document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose
generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the
best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\%
performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of
41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

### [524] [How Well Do LLMs Imitate Human Writing Style?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24930)
*Rebira Jemama,Rajesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的作者验证和风格模仿分析框架，结合TF-IDF字符n-gram和transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对。评估发现提示策略比模型大小对风格保真度影响更大，高保真模仿并不等同于人类不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅文本，但其复制特定人类作者独特风格的能力尚不清楚，需要开发有效的作者验证和风格模仿分析方法。

Method: 集成TF-IDF字符n-grams与transformer嵌入，通过经验距离分布分类文本对，无需监督训练或阈值调整。评估了三个模型家族的五个LLM和四种提示策略。

Result: 在学术论文上达到97.5%准确率，跨域评估94.5%，训练时间减少91.8%，内存使用减少59%。few-shot提示比zero-shot风格匹配准确率高23.5倍，完成提示与原作者风格一致率达99.9%。

Conclusion: 风格保真度和统计可检测性是可分离的，为作者建模、检测和身份条件生成提供了可复现的基础。高保真模仿不意味着人类不可预测性，人类论文困惑度平均29.5，而匹配的LLM输出仅15.2。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to
replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We
present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style
imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with
transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance
distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold
tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in
cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory
usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we
evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across
four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion.
Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on
style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher
style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\%
agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation
does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity
of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings
demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are
separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship
modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅需约2T高质量数据而非传统认为的10T+数据，就能在小型语言模型中实现强大的推理能力。MobileLLM-R1系列模型在远少于竞争对手的数据量下，推理性能显著超越同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前关于大语言模型推理能力的两个假设：推理能力仅在大模型中涌现，以及需要海量训练数据。特别针对第二个假设，探索是否真的需要超过10T tokens的庞大数据集。

Method: 通过精心筛选和重采样开源数据集，构建约2T tokens的高质量数据，然后使用4.2T tokens进行预训练，并采用成熟的后续训练流程。

Result: MobileLLM-R1-950M模型在AIME测试中得分15.5，远超OLMo-2-1.48B(0.6分)和SmolLM-2-1.7B(0.3分)。尽管只使用了Qwen3 11.7%的训练数据，但在多个推理基准测试中表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: 高质量数据比数据量更重要，推理能力可以在远少于传统认知的数据量下实现。这为资源受限环境下的高效模型训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses
to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1)
reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such
capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption
has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models
such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely
unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely
large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and
resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our
designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge
with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality
data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled
from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure,
enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter
reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully
open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of
15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B.
Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to
Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches
or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate
further research in this direction, we have released the complete training
recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with
the key insights obtained throughout this study.

TL;DR: MAQuE是一个用于评估医疗多轮问诊的基准测试，包含3000个模拟患者代理，涵盖语言模式、认知限制、情感反应等多样性，并提出了多维度评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI医生主要关注诊断技能和主动询问能力，但忽视了优秀医生所需的其他重要品质，如同理心、耐心和清晰沟通等。

Method: 构建了包含3000个模拟患者代理的基准测试MAQuE，这些代理具有多样化的语言模式、认知限制、情感反应和被动披露倾向，并设计了涵盖任务成功、询问熟练度、对话能力、询问效率和患者体验的多维度评估框架。

Result: 实验显示不同LLM在评估维度上都面临显著挑战，即使最先进的模型在询问能力方面仍有很大改进空间。模型对现实患者行为变化高度敏感，严重影响诊断准确性。细粒度指标揭示了不同评估视角之间的权衡。

Conclusion: MAQuE基准测试揭示了AI医生在现实临床环境中平衡性能与实用性所面临的挑战，强调了开发更全面医疗AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise,
patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have
successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the
ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential
qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present
MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the
automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It
features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse
linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies
for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework,
covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry
efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal
substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art
models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities.
These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior,
which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained
metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives,
highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in
real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: 提出SemanticShield框架，通过整合项目侧语义信息和LLM来检测推荐系统中的shilling攻击，在六种代表性攻击策略上表现有效且具有强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法主要关注用户侧行为，忽略了项目侧特征（如标题和描述）可能暴露的恶意意图，导致对shilling攻击的检测存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段检测框架：第一阶段使用低成本行为标准预筛选可疑用户，第二阶段通过LLM审计评估语义一致性。通过强化微调轻量级LLM来增强审计模型。

Result: 在六种代表性攻击策略上的实验证明了SemanticShield的有效性，对未见过的攻击方法也显示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemanticShield通过整合项目侧语义信息成功提升了shilling攻击检测效果，为推荐系统安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized
suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most
existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side
features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To
address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates
item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage
pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second
stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore,
we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a
lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a
specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative
attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against
shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods
shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文挑战了LLM置信度估计的传统方法，提出通过训练广义正确性模型(GCM)来系统学习历史正确性模式，而非依赖模型的自我认知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设LLM能够通过自我认知判断答案正确性，但实验表明这种自我预测能力并不优于其他模型。需要探索更有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 提出广义正确性模型(GCM)，通过注入历史正确性信息进行训练；探索上下文示例和事后校准等替代方法；在5个模型家族和多个数据集上评估。

Result: GCM能够跨数据集和模型学习正确性预测模式；答案措辞是正确性的强预测因子；历史信息注入和事后校准都能改善置信度估计。

Conclusion: 可靠的LLM置信度估计是通过系统编码正确性历史学习的通用技能，而非依赖模型特定的自我内省能力。

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for
deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open
challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting
a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its
own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some
privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the
model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict
the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an
unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a
"Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical
predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness
information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that
GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns
for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use
CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its
generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that
answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore
alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that
including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness
prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in
calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families
and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective
prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a
generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding
correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on
self-introspection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型蒸馏只关注行为模仿，将教师模型的内部计算视为黑盒。本文旨在蒸馏教师模型实现的基础计算机制。

Method: 提出电路蒸馏方法，匹配功能对应的电路组件，并引入反映这些组件诱导表征相似性的损失函数。

Result: 在实体追踪和心理理论任务上，电路蒸馏优于标准蒸馏，仅调整学生模型的小部分参数即可成功传递算法能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了传递机制的可行性，可能通过可解释和可控的内部学生机制实现教师模型特定能力的高效蒸馏。

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student
model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal
computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach:
Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher
model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an
objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit
components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match
``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss
reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We
evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks
using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit
distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring
algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student
model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring
mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted
teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student
mechanisms.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Motivation: 现有的多模态方面级情感分析模型难以过滤噪声视觉信号，并且无法有效跨模态对齐方面与意见内容。

Method: 使用门控多模态架构，集成语法、语义和融合感知的mLSTM，包括Syn-mLSTM（语法结构）、Sem-mLSTM（方面-语义相关性）和Fuse-mLSTM（选择性多模态融合）。

Result: 在两个Twitter基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，GateMABSA优于多个基线模型。

Conclusion: GateMABSA通过专门的mLSTM模块有效解决了多模态方面级情感分析中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the
multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images.
However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy
visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content
across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel
gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and
fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized
mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize
aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal
fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate
that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM解释性方法（如直接logit归因和稀疏自编码器）存在输出词汇表限制和特征命名不清晰等问题，对模型内部表示理解有限。

Method: 使用向量符号架构将模型残差流投影到可解释概念空间，结合稀疏自编码器和传统探测器的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了LLM向量空间信息解码，能从神经表示中提取更具信息性、可解释性和结构化的特征。

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型作为语音识别后处理模块的能力，特别关注其在纠正障碍语音识别错误方面的应用，旨在解决传统ASR系统在识别障碍语音时准确率较低的问题。

Method: 提出置信度提示方法，将词级不确定性估计直接嵌入LLM训练中，指导模型关注不确定的ASR区域并减少过度纠正。使用LLaMA 3.1模型进行微调，并与仅使用转录文本的微调和后验置信度过滤方法进行比较。

Result: 在Speech Accessibility Project自发语音数据集上相对WER降低10%，在TORGO数据集上相对WER降低47%，证明了置信度感知微调在障碍语音识别中的有效性。

Conclusion: 置信度感知的LLM微调方法能够显著提高障碍语音识别的准确性，为改善语音障碍人群的语音识别技术提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing
modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to
perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose
confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are
embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization
across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR
regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare
our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based
filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER
reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project
spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the
effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

Motivation: 研究Transformers在程序跟踪生成任务上的能力，该任务通过长跟踪序列外部化推理过程，其中每个步骤都很简单。

Method: 训练小型Transformers并使用多种修改，包括替代位置编码、softmax替代、混合模型和短卷积。

Result: 模型在分布内数据上达到强准确性，但在泛化到程序长度、跟踪步骤等不同因素时出现系统性失败，不过某些设计显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformers在程序跟踪生成任务上表现良好，但其泛化能力存在局限性，需要进一步改进模型设计来提升泛化性能。

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG),
where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs.
Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long
traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse
modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements,
hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong
in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to
various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs
significantly improve generalization.

TL;DR: DataMind是一个可扩展的数据合成和智能体训练框架，旨在构建通用数据智能体。它通过精细任务分类、知识增强轨迹采样、动态训练目标和稳定多轮代码执行框架，解决了开源数据智能体面临的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据智能体严重依赖闭源模型，而开源模型难以处理多样格式的大规模数据文件和长时程多步推理。需要构建开源通用数据智能体来推动自动化科学发现。

Method: 1) 精细任务分类和递归易到难任务组合机制；2) 知识增强轨迹采样和模型/规则过滤；3) 动态调整的SFT和RL损失训练目标；4) 内存高效稳定的代码多轮执行框架

Result: DataMind-14B在多个数据分析基准测试中达到71.16%的平均分，超越最强的闭源基线DeepSeek-V3.1和GPT-5。DataMind-7B在开源模型中表现最佳，得分68.10%。

Conclusion: DataMind框架成功构建了高性能的开源数据智能体，证明了其在数据合成和智能体训练方面的有效性，为社区提供了可操作的研究见解和资源。

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific
discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however,
rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source
models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and
long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This
paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe
designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key
challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient
data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn
rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a
recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and
difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling
strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically
adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a
memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on
DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning
diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic
tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with
an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming
the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B
also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also
incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the
analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic
training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B
for the community's future research.

TL;DR: jina-reranker-v3是一个0.6B参数的多语言文档重排序器，采用新颖的'最后但不晚交互'方法，在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的SOTA性能，比生成式列表重排序器小10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统晚交互模型（如ColBERT）在查询和文档编码后执行多向量匹配的局限性，通过更早的交互实现更丰富的跨文档交互。

Method: 在相同上下文窗口内对查询和文档进行因果自注意力计算，在提取每个文档最后一个token的上下文嵌入之前实现丰富的跨文档交互。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中达到61.94 nDCG@10的最先进性能，同时模型规模比生成式列表重排序器小10倍。

Conclusion: 提出的'最后但不晚交互'方法在紧凑的0.6B参数架构中实现了最先进的文档重排序性能，证明了该方法在效率和效果上的优势。

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that
introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction
models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector
matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and
documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document
interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of
each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR
performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative
listwise rerankers.

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用小型LLM在本地环境中部署的高效词汇简化框架，通过知识蒸馏和上下文学习等方法，发现模型输出概率可作为检测有害简化的有用信号，并提出过滤策略来抑制有害简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在词汇简化应用中面临隐私敏感和资源受限环境的挑战，且该技术的关键目标群体（如残障人士）需要确保输出的安全性和正确性。

Method: 使用可在本地部署的小型LLM构建高效框架，探索知识蒸馏与合成数据以及上下文学习作为基线方法，并提出基于模型输出概率的过滤策略来检测和抑制有害简化。

Result: 实验在五种语言上进行自动和手动评估，发现知识蒸馏虽然提高了自动指标分数，但也增加了有害简化，而模型输出概率是检测有害简化的有用信号。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用小型LLM进行高效安全的词汇简化建立了基准，突出了性能、效率和安全性之间的关键权衡，展示了安全实际部署的有前景方法。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face
challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS),
particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments.
Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one
of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety
and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we
propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs
deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge
distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our
experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and
manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts
automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing
harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output
probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications.
Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful
simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes
a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key
trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a
promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations
and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential.
However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while
open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect
personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep
Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It
pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising
questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question
answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new
paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction
annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes.
Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task
for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from
knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and
multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of
knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for
maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多语言大语言模型在事实核查中的语言偏见和检索偏见问题，评估了6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，发现模型在高资源语言上表现更好，并揭示了检索系统对某些信息的偏好偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在跨语言事实核查中表现出语言偏见，在高资源语言上表现优于低资源语言，同时存在检索系统偏向某些信息的问题，需要研究这些偏见对事实核查的影响。

Method: 使用AMC-16K数据集，通过完全多语言提示策略评估6个开源多语言LLM在20种语言上的表现，分析模型家族、规模和提示策略的影响，并利用多语言嵌入模型研究检索偏见。

Result: 发现LLM在单语和跨语言性能上存在显著差异，高资源语言表现更好；检索系统对某些声明的检索频率存在不均衡，导致热门声明检索性能虚高，而较少见声明代表性不足。

Conclusion: 多语言LLM存在持续的语言偏见，检索系统存在检索偏见，需要采取措施改进多语言事实核查的公平性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for
cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias,
performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English
than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept
- retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain
information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper,
we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked
Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20
languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K
dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities
in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on
model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent
bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in
multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed
multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims.
Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately
across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular
claims while under-representing less common ones.

TL;DR: PbT是一种无需人工标注或平行数据的教师-学生两阶段方法，通过将未配对样本压缩为中间表示，训练学生模型重构输入，从而生成高质量的合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源自然语言生成场景中只有输入或只有输出数据的问题，避免依赖少量示例或大型LLM生成的高成本合成数据。

Method: 使用教师LLM将未配对样本压缩为中间表示，训练学生模型从中间表示重构输入，从而生成输入-输出配对数据。

Result: 在5个基准测试中，8B参数的学生模型仅使用PbT数据就超越了使用70B教师生成语料训练的模型，接近人类标注对的性能，以三分之一成本缩小了82%的性能差距。

Conclusion: PbT能够生成与目标风格一致的简洁、忠实摘要，避免了直接合成中的不匹配问题，在低资源NLG场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline
that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel
data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios,
practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions,
or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom
both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely
on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses
this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise
intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs
from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs,
yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five
benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization
(SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired
setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained
only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora
and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated
pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of
direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only
PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style,
highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the
mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练前沿模型需要巨大的计算和能源投入，提高预训练效率对于开发更强大的LLM至关重要。虽然FP8训练已被广泛采用，但转向更窄的4位精度可以进一步改善计算速度和资源利用率，不过这种级别的量化在训练稳定性、收敛性和实现方面面临挑战。

Method: 集成随机Hadamard变换来限制块级异常值，采用二维量化方案确保前向和后向传播的一致表示，使用随机舍入进行无偏梯度估计，并包含选择性高精度层。

Result: 在100亿tokens上训练了一个120亿参数模型——这是迄今为止公开记录的最长4位精度训练运行。使用NVFP4预训练技术的模型在训练损失和下游任务准确率方面与FP8基线相当。

Conclusion: NVFP4结合所提出的训练方法代表了窄精度LLM训练算法的重大进步，证明了4位精度训练在大规模语言模型中的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many
domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size,
training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and
experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires
on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment
of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore
essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit
floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even
narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional
improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However,
quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence,
and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token
horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training
of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates
Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a
two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both
the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased
gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We
validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion
tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to
date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining
technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to
an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our
training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM
training algorithms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for
controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of
hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining.
However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations:
computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality
that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present
EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering
built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable
interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained
parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains,
and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's
optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over
existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications.
EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的论文质量评估方法推理成本高，而直接分数回归方法存在尺度不一致问题，需要开发更高效准确的评估框架。

Method: 采用领域-年份组内的成对学习减少评审评分不一致性，引入评审倾向信号(RTS)作为评审分数和置信度的概率整合，构建大规模数据集NAIDv2进行训练。

Conclusion: NAIPv2建立了去偏且可扩展的自动化论文质量评估框架，为未来科学智能系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how
both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future.
However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost,
whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale
inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for
paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year
groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review
Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and
confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a
large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and
detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling
efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable,
linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it
further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing
consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings
establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper
quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence
systems. Code and dataset are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在合成多来源文本时存在准确性激励不足和对抗性内容脆弱性问题，需要改进事实鲁棒性。

Method: TTS框架：(i) 将草稿摘要分解为原子声明，(ii) 获取每个来源对每个声明的立场，(iii) 使用多任务同伴预测机制评分来源，(iv) 在重新摘要前过滤不可靠来源。

Result: 实验表明TTS提高了事实准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持流畅性，使曝光与信息性佐证对齐并抑制操纵行为。

Conclusion: TTS通过形式化保证将来源激励与信息性诚实对齐，使真实报告成为效用最大化策略，有效提升了文本摘要的事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and
answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a
single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be
accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text
Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual
robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis
into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii)
scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that
rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before
re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives
with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing
strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness
while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and
disincentivizing manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了Learn2PD框架，通过训练轻量级自适应过滤器模型来预测每个token位置是否匹配最终输出，实现动态并行解码，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码在大语言模型中需要O(n)顺序步骤，限制了推理吞吐量。现有的并行解码策略使用固定的启发式方法，无法适应输入特定特征，导致速度-质量权衡不佳。

Method: Learn2PD框架训练轻量级过滤器模型预测token位置是否正确预测，结合EoTP检测解码完成，避免填充token的冗余解码。

Result: 在LLaDA基准测试中，方法实现了最高22.58倍加速且无性能损失，结合KV-Cache可达57.51倍加速。

Conclusion: Learn2PD提供了一种灵活的动态并行解码方法，通过后训练学习自适应过滤器，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting
inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token
generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding
strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence
thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting
in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work,
we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We
propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a
lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position,
whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter
approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when
correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a
post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize
it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction
(EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by
interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and
applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent
powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search
tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and
apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase
question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search
tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing
transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of
agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring
the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and
also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our
tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage
recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search
behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves
reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy
on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming
prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

TL;DR: 研究表明，通过精心设计的提示，大型语言模型能够保持甚至提升在翻译不常见语言时的表现，特别是在IOI风格任务的自动翻译中表现可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在数学和计算机科学任务翻译中表现不佳的问题，特别是在从罗马尼亚语翻译到英语时，这对于编程竞赛自动翻译、高质量教育材料创建以及减少人工翻译错误至关重要。

Method: 评估了多种翻译方法和多个LLM模型（包括OpenRoLLM、Llama 3.1 8B、Llama 3.2 3B和GPT-4o），通过重复运行评估翻译准确性和性能稳定性，并进行详细的句法和语义分析。

Result: LLMs在适当监督下能够可靠地用于IOI风格任务的自动翻译，并且与人工翻译相比具有竞争力，同时增强了OJI罗马尼亚数据集的价值。

Conclusion: 在人类监督下，LLMs可以作为多语言问题解决的可信解决方案，在现实场景中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that large language models (LLMs) underperform
on mathematical and computer science tasks when these problems are translated
from Romanian into English, compared to their original Romanian format.
Accurate translation is critical for applications ranging from automatic
translations in programming competitions to the creation of high-quality
educational materials, as well as minimizing errors or fraud in human
translations. This study shows that robust large language models (LLMs) can
maintain or even enhance their performance in translating less common languages
when given well-structured prompts. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with
appropriate supervision, can be reliably used for the automatic translation of
IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-style tasks. We evaluate several
translation methods across multiple LLMs, including OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B,
Llama 3.2 3B and GPT-4o, assessing their translation accuracy and performance
stability through repeated runs. Additionally, we augment the OJI (Romanian
County-Level Informatics Olympiad) Romanian dataset with accurate English
translations, enhancing its utility for future LLM training and evaluation.
Through detailed syntactic and semantic analyses, we confirm that with human
oversight, LLMs can serve as a viable solution for multilingual
problem-solving. We also compare the translation quality of LLMs against human
translators, as evaluated by a certified expert, underscoring the potential of
LLMs in realworld scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究创建了一个基于罗马尼亚游戏节目的多语言文化数据集，发现LLMs在国际问题上的表现(80-95%)明显优于罗马尼亚特定文化问题(50-75%)，揭示了文化背景对模型性能的重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在不同语言和文化背景下的表现存在差异，需要研究文化因素对模型性能的影响，特别是在教育资源有限的语种中。

Method: 通过OCR、自动文本提取和人工验证从罗马尼亚游戏节目收集问答对，并添加问题领域、文化相关性和难度等元数据。对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试，包括机器翻译和跨语言实验。

Result: 模型在国际问题上的准确率达到80-95%，而在罗马尼亚特定文化问题上的准确率仅为50-75%。通过机器翻译和法语数据集对比实验进一步验证了文化背景的影响。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据来源对LLM性能有显著影响，为构建稳健、文化感知的多语言NLP系统提供了实用见解，特别是在教育领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出VocabTrim技术，通过重构drafter模型的LM头来限制词汇表大小，减少推理开销，提升内存受限环境下的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于drafter的推测解码方法在词汇表映射上存在不必要的推理开销，特别是在目标LLM词汇表很大的情况下，这限制了在内存受限设备上的性能。

Method: VocabTrim技术重构drafter的LM头，只包含目标模型词汇表中最常采样的有限token集合，从而减少推理延迟。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上，该方法将Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct的内存受限加速比提升了16%。

Conclusion: VocabTrim通过限制drafter词汇表大小，在轻微降低接受率的情况下显著减少推理延迟，有效提升内存受限环境下的生成速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the
performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that
incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A
drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language
models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree
consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target
model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered
that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies
of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the
vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We
first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an
unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs
with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,
to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in
memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain
only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the
vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting
slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting
latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,
resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can
boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically
by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Method: 使用GRILE基准测试（来自罗马尼亚高利害考试的1,151道选择题）评估7个多语言和罗马尼亚特定LLMs的两个能力：正确答案选择和语言准确解释生成。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro达到83%准确率，但大多数开源模型低于65%，48%的解释存在事实或教学缺陷，主要弱点在形态学和DOOM3正字法规范应用。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language

unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy

Motivation: 改进复杂现实世界事件相关视频的识别和检索，通过自动提取事件相关的潜在参数知识来增强对简化人类查询的理解。

Method: Q2E查询到事件分解方法，使用LLMs和VLMs中的知识分解查询，支持视觉和语音输入，采用基于熵的融合评分进行零样本融合。

Result: 在两个多样化数据集和多个检索指标上的评估表明，Q2E优于多个最先进的基线方法，音频信息的集成能显著提升文本到视频检索性能。

Conclusion: Q2E方法能有效利用多模态知识提升视频检索性能，特别是在复杂事件理解方面，音频信息的加入带来显著改进。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了局部对抗攻击的有效性、不可感知性和计算效率，发现相比全局攻击，局部攻击能显著降低像素扰动并提高图像质量指标，但需要更多计算资源且攻击成功率略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索，本研究旨在系统评估局部对抗攻击的性能表现。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的对抗攻击方法上实施局部化攻击，并量化比较其效果。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击具有更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM值，但计算量增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（PGD、C&W）比单步方法（FGSM）对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 局部对抗攻击在保持攻击效果的同时提高了不可感知性，为改进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出上下文持续学习(ICCL)方法，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习能力，研究发现特定大语言模型在ICCL中受益于分布式练习，表现出类似人类的记忆保留模式，并提出了衡量人类保留相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在连续多任务设置中是否能实现长期保留和跨任务知识积累，受人类记忆研究启发，研究ICL在多任务环境中的保留特性。

Method: 提出上下文持续学习(ICCL)方法，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习，在Markov-Chain基准上进行实验，分析分布式练习对保留的影响，并提出人类保留相似度指标。

Result: 实验表明特定大语言模型在ICCL中受益于分布式练习，表现出类似人类的记忆保留模式，线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出特别接近人类的保留模式，尽管其保留性能不如基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一种仅需推理的持续学习范式，缓解灾难性遗忘并解决传统CL方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构间的协作学习挑战，确保互操作性同时保护隐私

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，实现了更优的通信效率，并在异构架构下保持稳定训练性能

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构模型协作学习中的通信效率和隐私保护问题

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的关系恢复能力，提出了关系图识别(RGR)框架，推导出容量缩放定律：$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$，并证明了多头注意力在压缩嵌入场景下的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能学习token间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道建模为m个节点m'条有向边的图，分析总键维度$D_K$与可恢复关系数的关系，通过信息论下界和显式构造证明容量缩放定律。

Result: 推导出容量缩放定律$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$，实验验证了性能阈值与理论预测一致，多头分配$D_K$能缓解压缩嵌入导致的干扰。

Conclusion: 提供了自注意力容量的具体缩放定律和跨头分配键-查询预算的原则性设计规则，解释了多头注意力在压缩场景下的优势。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Motivation: 结构化数据中的对抗鲁棒性研究相对不足，而表格数据在现实决策系统中广泛应用，存在严重安全风险。

Method: 采用黑盒决策攻击框架，结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索策略，能够有效处理离散和连续特征空间。

Result: 攻击成功率超过90%，几乎覆盖所有测试集样本，对从传统机器学习分类器到LLM流水线的各类模型均有效，且查询次数很少。

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实决策系统迫切需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PoP方法，通过偏好之间的偏好标注来推断自适应边距，在UltraFeedback数据集上优于标准DPO和固定边距DPO，并揭示了判别性能与生成性能之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于边距的优化方法在RLHF中通常使用无边距、固定边距或简单函数边距，无法考虑不同偏好的强度差异，且依赖可能嘈杂的评分信息。建模偏好强度可以带来更好的泛化能力和对齐效果。

Method: 提出DPO-PoP方法，利用偏好之间的偏好标注（即哪个偏好反映更强的区分）来推断每个数据点的自适应边距，扩展了直接偏好优化（DPO）框架。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP在判别和生成性能上均优于标准DPO、固定边距DPO和真实边距DPO。同时发现判别性能与生成性能存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 通过偏好之间的偏好标注可以有效地推断自适应边距，改善RLHF中的奖励模型学习。针对判别与生成性能的权衡，提出了两种采样策略来收集偏好之间的偏好标签。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Result: 理论证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，并在真实数据上验证了攻击效果

Conclusion: 揭示了在线学习排序算法对对抗攻击的严重脆弱性，为算法安全性提供了重要警示

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

Result: 有限样本下不同采样方法的GP后验各不相同，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同分布；后验协方差不可比较，说明没有采样方法在所有情况下都占优。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法的理论分析揭示了其在有限样本下的差异性，以及没有绝对最优方法的事实，这与实际观察一致。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种声学异常检测方法在水电站预测性维护中的应用，OC-SVM在准确性和训练时间方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业工厂和能源生产商中的非计划停机成本高昂且难以维护，现有声学异常检测研究主要依赖通用工业或合成数据集，针对水电站的研究较少。

Method: 在强噪声条件下进行声学预处理，提取时域和频域特征，然后对LSTM AE、K-Means和OC-SVM三种机器学习模型进行基准测试，使用奥地利Rodundwerk II抽水蓄能电站的两个真实数据集。

Result: One-Class SVM实现了最佳准确率（ROC AUC 0.966-0.998）和最小训练时间的平衡，LSTM自编码器提供了强大的检测能力（ROC AUC 0.889-0.997）但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: OC-SVM是水电站声学异常检测的有效方法，在准确性和效率方面表现优异，适合实际工业应用。

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Result: 在多个领域的多个数据集上进行了实验，充分利用了可交换性假设

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效审计联邦学习模型的公平性，为不同人口群体提供条件覆盖保证

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了理论基础扎实且实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和可解耦的表示是AI的核心挑战，现有方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能性约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调MLP头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习紧凑表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，表示比基准紧凑9倍、鲁棒性高1.5倍，保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI上表示紧凑3.4倍、鲁棒性高1.4倍。

Conclusion: MonoCon通过功能性约束学习鲁棒、超紧凑表示，为边缘计算到云检索等不同场景提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化感知训练是提高量化神经网络精度的关键技术，但FP阶段和QAT阶段之间的计算资源最优分配比例尚不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过在不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型规模下进行大量实验，分析QAT持续时间对最终性能的影响，并基于实验数据推导损失缩放定律。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，该比例可通过tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量准确预测，提出的cooldown和QAT融合方法可显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，能够在相同计算预算下训练出更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，理解其预条件器作为白化矩阵近似的性质，并建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性。

Method: 通过理论分析建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的等价性，并使用nanoGPT和灰度图像着色实验进行实证评估。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo收敛速度相似，在最终损失方面与Adam和Shampoo相比无显著优势，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在语言建模任务中表现出色，但在理论分析和实验验证中与Shampoo等价，没有明显优于Adam和Shampoo的最终性能。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下精度时会出现困惑度下降，主要因为异常值表示导致共享相同尺度的参数出现精度问题，这在无校准均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: 在现有后训练量化器基础上增加第二轴尺度因子，使用快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上评估，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度，相比无校准均匀量化基线有显著提升，且可与校准和非均匀量化级别结合进一步增强。

Conclusion: SINQ方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构以量化任何线性层，为解决低比特量化中的精度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）来近似逆Hessian算子，构建FNO-CG方法，为共轭梯度法提供初始化。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的数值实验表明，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG将平均相对误差减少62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态情况下改进最为显著。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法对具有挑战性的数据同化问题展现出鲁棒性和高效性，特别是在病态情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster

realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

TL;DR: T-Tamer是一个多阶段决策框架，通过引入召回机制（允许重新访问早期模型）来优化级联模型的准确性与延迟权衡，并证明召回策略能在多项式时间内达到最优权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型规模和复杂度的增长，高效服务面临准确性、延迟、资源使用等多目标权衡问题。当前策略多为启发式且特定于案例，缺乏理论保证和通用性。

Method: 将级联模型服务形式化为多阶段决策过程，确定何时退出以及咨询哪个模型。关键创新是引入召回机制，允许重新访问早期模型。

Result: 理论证明：无召回策略无法获得常数因子近似最优权衡，而基于召回的策略可在多项式时间内达到最优权衡。在合成数据集和视觉/NLP基准上的实验验证了召回策略能持续产生高效的准确性-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 该工作为早期退出和级联模型设计提供了连接启发式实践与理论保证的原则性基础，召回机制是实现可证明性能保证的关键要素。

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将变分方法融入稀疏自编码器(SAE)是否能改善特征组织和可解释性，但发现变分SAE(vSAE)在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，虽然特征独立性更好但存在更多死特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能通过概率采样和KL散度正则化来改善SAE的特征组织，使特征在潜在空间中更连贯且避免重叠。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中随机采样替换确定性ReLU门控，并加入朝向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。在Pythia-70M transformer残差流激活上评估Topk vSAE与标准TopK SAE。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，KL散度项产生过度正则化压力，显著减少活跃特征比例，导致性能下降。vSAE特征虽表现出更好的鲁棒性，但死特征数量远多于基线。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准误差定义，在指数样本复杂度和多项式样本复杂度之间插值，使用多项式样本校准预测器，并在一个端点上实现了近乎最优的误差依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类预测器的校准特别具有挑战性，因为可能的预测值数量呈指数级增长。现有校准误差概念要么需要指数级样本，要么需要多项式样本，但各有局限。

Method: 提出新的校准误差定义，在两种现有概念之间插值。使用自适应数据分析技术，具有高适应性但仅对数级样本复杂度开销。

Result: 算法能够使用多项式样本校准任何给定预测器，覆盖除一个端点外的整个插值范围。在另一个端点上，相比先前工作改进了误差参数的依赖性。

Conclusion: 新方法在多类预测器校准中实现了样本复杂度的显著改进，通过自适应数据分析技术平衡了适应性和样本效率。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Conclusion: SPS-GAN成功解决了多系统动力学建模问题，能够从任意测量类型中发现构型空间结构，实现了物理上合理的生成。

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏专家混合模型通常针对固定稀疏度训练，需要维护多个模型来满足不同效率目标，增加了训练、维护成本并限制了部署灵活性。

Method: 通过跨稀疏度混合训练和在高稀疏度下的短课程学习，无需架构更改，将单个检查点转换为稀疏度控制面。

Result: 实验显示PHDS匹配或超过专用oracle模型，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现了可预测的精度/延迟权衡。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS使全局稀疏度成为一级服务原语，简化了MoE运行时部署，提供了灵活的稀疏度控制能力。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型复杂能力的涌现，需要从表示几何的角度来理解训练动态。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩和特征谱衰减，分析OLMo和Pythia模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现了三个一致的几何阶段：初始坍缩、熵寻求阶段（维度扩展）和压缩寻求阶段（选择性维度收缩），后训练方法如SFT、DPO和RLVR会进一步改变表示几何。

Conclusion: 语言模型的训练动态可以从表示几何的角度理解，不同训练阶段和后训练方法会驱动不同的几何变化，影响模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Motivation: 灾难性干扰（灾难性遗忘）是机器学习中的一个基本挑战，当模型适应新任务时会逐渐丧失对先前学习任务的性能。本文旨在从潜在表示学习的角度更好地理解和建模这个问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从部分任务感知（PTA）和全任务感知（ATA）配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 通过理论保证和实证验证，证明识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效减轻机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰，在合成和基准数据集上都取得了实际性能改进。

Conclusion: 将灾难性干扰建模为识别问题，并通过识别共享潜在变量来最小化PTA和ATA设置之间的距离，为缓解灾难性遗忘提供了理论保证和实用方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)越来越容易受到越狱攻击，这些对抗性提示会绕过对齐约束并引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融和法律合规等关键领域的安全性、可靠性和可信度。

Method: GuardNet构建结构化图，结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力衍生标记关系，捕捉越狱行为的语言结构和上下文模式。然后应用图神经网络在两个层面：(i)提示级过滤器检测全局对抗性提示，(ii)标记级过滤器精确定位细粒度对抗性片段。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验显示，GuardNet显著优于现有防御方法。在LLM-Fuzzer上将提示级F1分数从66.4%提升至99.8%，在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升至超过94%。标记级F1从48-75%提升至74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: 尽管结构复杂，GuardNet保持了可接受的延迟并在跨域评估中泛化良好，使其成为实际LLM部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和复杂能量景观中收敛缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。需要能够生成全局配置的提议机制来加速收敛。

Method: 训练Transformer模型从平衡样本中学习，生成整个自旋配置作为Metropolis步骤中的全局移动提议，与传统的单自旋翻转互补使用。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中，IsingFormer重现了磁化和自由能曲线，显著减少平衡时间；在3D自旋玻璃优化中，找到更低能量状态；在整数分解问题中，成功泛化到未见过的半素数。

Conclusion: IsingFormer证明神经网络提议可以系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，通过捕捉全局结构实现更快的采样和更强的组合优化性能，并能泛化到整个问题家族。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

### [589] [Understanding Language Prior of LVLMs by Contrasting Chain-of-Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23050)
*Lin Long,Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过链式嵌入分析揭示了大型视觉语言模型中语言先验的内部机制，发现了视觉整合点(VIP)现象，并提出了总视觉整合(TVI)估计器来量化视觉信息对模型行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要通过输入-输出探测来分析语言先验，但无法揭示视觉信息何时以及如何影响模型行为的内部机制。

Method: 提出链式嵌入分析方法，通过层间表示动态研究模型内部机制，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并开发总视觉整合(TVI)估计器。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合中，VIP现象普遍存在，TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该研究为诊断和理解LVLMs中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

### [590] [Dynamics of Learning: Generative Schedules from Latent ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23052)
*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态系统建模的新型学习率调度器，通过学习超参数搜索的训练过程来预测最佳长期验证性能的学习率计划，在图像分类和语言模型任务中达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单参数函数，要么仅对短期训练信号做出反应，缺乏对神经网络训练过程的全面时间视角建模。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测具有最佳长期验证性能的未来学习率计划。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和transformer语言模型上达到SOTA结果，训练出的模型位于损失景观更平坦区域，提供更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到机器学习实验跟踪平台，能够生成与常见参数函数明显不同的专门化学习率计划。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于谱相干性的可预测性对齐诊断框架，包含SCP评分和LUR诊断工具，揭示了时间序列预测中可预测性漂移现象和模型架构权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估指标将模型性能与数据内在不可预测性混淆的问题，推动从简单聚合评分转向更深入的可预测性感知评估。

Method: 开发了谱相干可预测性(SCP)评分和线性利用比率(LUR)诊断工具，前者量化预测任务的固有难度，后者测量模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 首次系统性证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，发现复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在可预测性高的任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: 需要范式转变，采用更深入的可预测性感知评估方法，促进更公平的模型比较和更深入理解模型行为。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

*Reza Rahimi Azghan,Gautham Krishna Gudur,Mohit Malu,Edison Thomaz,Giulia Pedrielli,Pavan Turaga,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CLAD-Net框架，通过结合自监督Transformer和监督CNN，解决可穿戴传感器数据在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上达到91.36%的最终准确率，仅8.78%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型通常假设数据分布是平稳的，但在真实场景中，不同用户的可穿戴传感器数据存在分布偏移。连续学习框架下，这种偏移会导致灾难性遗忘问题，同时人类研究中的标注数据稀缺且不一致。

Method: CLAD-Net整合了自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和监督CNN。Transformer通过跨传感器注意力捕获全局活动模式，学习无需标签的可泛化表示；CNN通过知识蒸馏在按用户微调时保留先验知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%的最终准确率，仅8.78%的遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法。在半监督设置下（仅10-20%标注数据），仍能保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net通过结合自监督和监督学习，有效解决了可穿戴传感器连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，对标注数据稀缺具有鲁棒性，消融研究验证了各模块的贡献。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免前向激活的方差崩溃或饱和，从而在没有归一化层的情况下实现可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不恰当的初始化会导致非线性激活函数引起饱和、方差崩溃和学习率敏感性问题。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出了专门的初始化方法，通过闭式解选择噪声尺度，使前向激活在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 经验表明该方法在没有归一化层的情况下训练可靠，表现出强大的数据效率，并且能够使标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、Orthogonal）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数实现学习。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化的相互依赖问题，为特定激活函数类提供了有效的初始化策略，提升了训练稳定性和数据效率。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种新的评论家架构，通过学习完整的状态-动作回报分布来增强基于流的策略，在离线强化学习中取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其潜力受到传统评论家只能学习单一标量期望回报的限制，需要更丰富的学习信号。

Method: 使用流匹配技术，将回报分布建模为从简单基础分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换，而不是回归到单一值。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中表现出色，特别是在需要多模态动作分布的任务上，在离线和离线到在线微调方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过提供丰富的分布式贝尔曼目标，为基于流的策略提供了更稳定和信息丰富的学习信号，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了网络基础模型(NFMs)中编码的潜在知识，通过三部分评估分析隐藏表示：嵌入几何分析、度量对齐评估和因果敏感性测试，揭示了现有模型存在显著的各向异性、不一致特征敏感性等问题，并证明解决这些问题可显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注网络基础模型在下游任务中的性能表现，而缺乏对其内部编码知识的系统性分析。本文旨在通过分析隐藏表示来深入理解NFMs的知识编码能力。

Method: 采用三部分评估框架：1)嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用；2)度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系；3)因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用5个不同网络数据集评估4个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 所有评估的NFMs都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等特性。通过解决这些限制可以显著提升模型性能(最高提升0.35 F1分数，无需架构更改)。

Conclusion: 网络基础模型在知识编码方面存在系统性限制，通过识别和解决这些限制可以显著改进模型性能，为未来NFMs的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型对训练数据微小扰动的敏感性，以便在重新训练前预测模型输出的变化，节省计算成本。

Method: 开发了一种闭式程序来计算扩散模型映射的方向导数，仅需预训练分数模型及其对输入的导数的黑盒访问。

Result: 该方法能够估计扩散模型样本对目标度量加性扰动的敏感性，运行时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。

Conclusion: 该方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，产生的敏感性与图像扩散模型在重新训练和微调后样本的变化相关。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的奖励塑造框架，通过引入因果一致性代理来减少LLM的奖励破解和不忠实推理，提高模型对因果扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小的因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: 使用基于雅可比矩阵的敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实硬化抑制干扰线索，并通过Minkowski组合器将因果一致性得分与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验结果显示，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确率（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO能够有效减少奖励破解和不忠实推理链，在保持接近同等准确性的同时显著提高模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Motivation: 区块链的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，挑战反洗钱监管。需要能够捕捉结构和时间依赖性的模型，同时抵抗噪声、不平衡和对抗行为。

Method: 使用GCN、GAT和GIN的集成框架，采用软投票集成方法，在Elliptic数据集上进行训练和评估。

Conclusion: 集成GNN是实用且前瞻性的解决方案，既提供即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强的金融安全分析铺平道路。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

TL;DR: 提出8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用，在LLM预训练中优于AdamW和8位AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但其状态存储需求与AdamW类似。现有的8位AdamW变体主要通过动态量化来保持稳定性，但需要探索更稳定的量化方案。

Method: 开发了8位Muon优化器，采用分块量化技术，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。通过理论分析解释了其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon相比全精度版本减少了约74%的内存占用，在1.6B模型预训练和Llama 3.2 3B模型微调中均表现出色，性能接近原始Muon，优于AdamW及其8位变体。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效的优化器选择。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期行为的挑战，需要开发能够有效捕捉这些特性的统一框架。

Method: 采用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，使用分层注意力捕获日和周依赖关系，结合预计算提示嵌入来增强表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架成功地将LLM应用于人类移动预测，通过创新的时间标记化和分层注意力机制，在保持预测精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种基于掩码感知条件流匹配的表格数据填补框架，能够处理不同类型的缺失机制，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中普遍存在缺失值，现有填补方法要么假设过于严格，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 使用掩码感知目标函数，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时对观测条目施加稳定性惩罚；结合一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入；推理时使用约束保持的ODE积分和逐步投影。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最先进的结果，比竞争方法提供更鲁棒、高效和高质量的填补效果。

Conclusion: 流匹配方法为表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

TL;DR: 提出TRRO框架和PIRO算法，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证专家行为似然单调提升，解决了逆强化学习中训练不稳定问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代逆强化学习方法使用对抗式训练导致不稳定，而基于能量的非对抗方法缺乏理论保证，需要填补这一空白

Method: 提出TRRO理论框架，保证专家行为似然单调提升，并实例化为PIRO算法，使用Minorization-Maximization过程

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率方面匹配或超越最先进基线

Conclusion: TRRO为逆强化学习提供了类似TRPO在正向强化学习中的稳定性保证，PIRO是实用且稳定的IRL算法

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一框架，将隐式神经表示(INR)配置作为优化问题，使用贝叶斯优化自动选择激活函数和初始化参数，替代手动调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置缺乏系统化策略，依赖临时启发式方法或暴力搜索，导致跨模态结果不一致，需要统一的优化框架。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）和连续初始化参数的联合空间中进行高效搜索。

Result: OptiINR能够找到全局最优配置，在各种信号处理应用中持续最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR为INR设计建立了原则性基础，用数据驱动的优化过程替代了碎片化的手动调优。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，通过将键值对重新构想为局部专家，为每个查询自适应选择相关时间戳，解决了传统Transformer在时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在时间序列建模中采用'一刀切'的上下文聚合方式，无法有效处理滞后效应和异常段这两个关键挑战。滞后效应指历史时间戳与查询的相关性动态变化，异常段引入噪声信号降低预测精度。

Method: 提出TMOE机制：1) 将键值对视为局部专家，每个专家专注于不同的时间上下文；2) 通过局部过滤无关时间戳为每个查询自适应选择专家；3) 保留共享全局专家以捕捉长期依赖关系。将TMOE集成到PatchTST和Timer框架中，分别得到TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G。

Result: 在7个真实世界长期预测基准测试上的广泛实验表明，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，通过局部专家自适应选择和全局专家保留，在不改变结构的情况下显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Mirror-Critique框架，通过对比模型生成解与真实解来训练具有信息性批判能力的验证器，显著提升了LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于奖励模型的选择方法往往无法识别少数但正确的答案，这限制了其有效性。主要原因是验证器训练缺乏信息性批判信号。

Method: 使用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批判数据，教导验证器不仅知道什么是错误的，还知道为什么错误。将合成数据用于RLVR过程冷启动LLM，通过生成多个批判来评估候选解。

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解决方案准确性方面显著优于多数投票，并提高了求解器识别自身能力边界并拒绝回答的诚实性。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号，有效提升了LLM的推理性能和诚实性，超越了传统的多数投票方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法大多使用生成式方法，但缺乏直接DFT信号反馈，主要原因是DFT计算成本高。作者希望通过在线强化学习将直接DFT信号整合到材料设计循环中。

Method: 提出了CrystalGym强化学习环境，使用DFT直接计算能带隙、体模量和密度等属性作为奖励信号，对常见的基于值和策略的强化学习算法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明不同算法在不同环境设置下具有不同的样本效率和收敛到最优解的难易程度，但没有一个算法能解决所有CrystalGym任务。

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习研究者和材料科学家提供了一个处理耗时奖励信号的真实世界设计问题测试平台，为未来跨学科研究铺平道路。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Result: 在36名老年人6个月数据上的评估显示，两种技术联合使用将AUPRC从0.637提升到0.766

Conclusion: 被动感知技术结合先进的机器学习方法，为老年人群认知障碍的可扩展监测提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供层次化原型来捕获全局和局部时间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式，在关键场景中需要建立信任。

Method: 基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，保留丰富的异质信息；通过层次化原型组织，粗粒度原型捕获全局时间模式，细粒度原型捕获局部变化。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试（包括新发布的LOF数据集）上，ProtoTS在预测精度上超过现有方法，并提供专家可指导的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoTS不仅实现了更高的预测准确性，还提供了专家可指导的解释，有助于更好的模型理解和决策支持。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集联想记忆模型仅限于向量表示，需要扩展到概率分布空间，以桥接经典DAMs与现代生成建模，实现分布存储和检索。

Method: 定义基于存储分布的log-sum-exp能量函数，构建通过最优传输映射Gibbs加权聚合的检索动态，固定点对应于自一致的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该工作将联想记忆从向量提升到完整分布，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新框架。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习领域尚未探索，该领域的目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 1. 系统比较LoRA和适配器调优在大型算子模型上的性能；2. 理论分析LoRA在傅里叶层中的近似误差下界；3. 提出频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，根据谱复杂度分配适配器容量。

Result: F-Adapter在多个挑战性3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进结果，显著提高了泛化能力和谱保真度，优于LoRA和其他PEFT技术。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域的有效范式，适配器方法比LoRA更适合处理偏微分方程解的谱稀疏特性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时熵最小化能帮助模型适应新环境并激发推理能力，但纯熵最小化容易导致非泛化的捷径解（如膨胀logit范数或主导类别预测），产生崩溃解。

Method: 设计了高效的ZeroSiam非对称孪生架构，通过可学习预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作实现非对称散度对齐，防止崩溃。

Result: 实证和理论证明ZeroSiam不仅能防止崩溃解，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在视觉适应和大型语言模型推理任务中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam方法简单有效，在各种测试场景和模型（包括易崩溃的小模型）中均表现出色，计算开销极小。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Result: 实验结果表明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: CoSIFL的集成设计有效平衡了安全性、隐私保护和激励机制，为联邦学习提供了全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM推理中的实际表现，发现现有方法在FP4量化中存在关键问题，并提出MR-GPTQ算法和高效GPU内核来优化FP4量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式(MXFP4和NVFP4)承诺革新LLM推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证，需要系统评估现有量化方法在FP4格式上的表现。

Method: 提出Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ)算法，通过分块Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适应FP4的独特特性，并开发高性能GPU内核实现旋转融合和快速激活计算。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现层间3.6倍和端到端2.2倍加速，在RTX5090上实现层间6倍和端到端4倍加速，显著提升MXFP4精度至接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但格式专用方法如MR-GPTQ能够解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

Method: 提出CV-ICRL方法，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时策略理论上可达到的理想性能。随着上下文扩展，上下文价值应是非递减的。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过引入上下文价值解决了上下文模糊性问题，为ICRL提供了更可靠的性能保证，推动了单调改进的实现。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、网络安全或车辆诊断等领域，理解具有数千个稀疏事件类型的事件序列中的因果关系至关重要，但现有方法无法扩展到如此大规模的数据。

Method: 使用两个预训练Transformer作为密度估计器，通过一次性因果自回归方法推断每个序列的马尔可夫边界，实现并行因果发现。

Result: 在包含29,100个事件和474个标签的真实世界汽车数据集上，OSCAR在几分钟内恢复了可解释的因果结构，而经典方法无法扩展。

Conclusion: OSCAR能够在生产规模上实现实用的科学诊断，解决了大规模稀疏事件序列中的因果发现可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event
types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle
diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot
causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using
two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient,
parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world
automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers
interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to
scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

TL;DR: WirelessMathLM通过领域特定的强化学习训练小型模型(0.5B-7B)，在无线通信数学问题上达到或超越大型模型性能，无需人类反馈，仅使用可验证正确性作为奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用数学推理上表现优异，但在专业无线通信数学问题上表现糟糕，需要开发专门针对该领域的高效模型。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和二元验证奖励，直接从基础检查点训练模型，无需监督预热，利用无线数学问题的可验证正确性特性。

Result: 7B模型在WirelessMathBench-XL上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o(40.4%)，参数数量少100倍；GRPO训练使所有模型规模性能几乎翻倍，并在通用数学基准上实现正向迁移。

Conclusion: 通过领域特定的强化学习和可验证正确性奖励，小型模型可以在专业数学领域达到大型模型性能，同时提升通用数学能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL通过将推测性解码与RL rollout过程集成，重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，在不影响策略质量的情况下将rollout时间减少2-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地依赖带可验证奖励的强化学习来引发可靠的思维链推理，但训练过程仍受限于计算昂贵的rollout阶段。现有加速方法存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽略迭代间冗余的问题。

Method: 提出SPEC-RL框架，集成推测性解码与RL rollout过程，重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型和优先级生成在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，解决深度不平衡回归问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实回归任务中数据分布严重偏斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本学习，但无法准确预测少数标签。深度不平衡回归缺乏适合高维数据的专用数据级解决方案

Method: 使用条件扩散模型和基于优先级的生成方法，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，适用于图像、文本等高维输入

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试中，在少数区域取得显著改进，同时保持整体准确性

Conclusion: LatentDiff为深度不平衡回归提供了有效的数据级解决方案，计算效率高且适用于多种数据模态

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ATDP方法，通过针对敏感token梯度施加差异化噪声，在保护隐私的同时大幅减少训练时间并保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPSGD对所有梯度均匀加噪，导致训练时间显著延长且模型精度下降。需要一种能针对性保护敏感信息同时最小化性能影响的隐私保护方法

Method: ATDP自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用较大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量轻量级后处理

Result: 相比传统DP-SGD方法，ATDP将训练时间减少约90%，提供相当或更好的隐私保护，同时精度损失最小

Conclusion: ATDP是一种高效隐私保护方案，可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型通用能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

<details>

Motivation: 传统参数化降阶建模方法在高维参数空间中面临插值困难或不可靠的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来处理高维参数化子空间预测。

Method: 使用神经网络作为高维目标函数的近似，引入多种适合子空间数据的损失函数，并通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来增加冗余，从而简化学习问题。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，预测大于所需维度的子空间能显著提高精度，该方法在椭圆特征问题、参数偏微分方程求解等多种任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法为高维参数化降阶建模提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过神经网络和冗余预测策略克服了传统插值方法的局限性。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活高效的替代方案，具有顺序生成、样本多样性和在线优化等优势

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习最优ALM策略而非学习环境，实现了优越性能，其优势不依赖于复杂神经网络或改进的参数估计。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 循环深度transformer通过迭代潜在计算来扩展测试时计算。研究发现迭代过程呈现两尺度几何特性：块内为小尺度细化，块间为大尺度漂移。基于此提出了基于二阶步长差的早退机制，相比现有方法在性能、稳定性和时间效率上更优。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究循环深度transformer中迭代过程的几何特性，理解其计算动态，并基于此改进早退机制以提高效率。

Method: 分析循环迭代的几何特性，提出两尺度操作模型，并设计基于二阶步长差的早退机制。

Result: 测量显示循环步骤变得更小且更正交，表明更好地建模局部精细结构。提出的早退机制在性能、稳定性和时间效率上优于KL散度方法和一阶对应方法。

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代动态呈现两尺度特性，基于二阶步长差的早退机制是更有效的退出策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

TL;DR: 提出MELCOT混合模型，结合经典机器学习边际估计和深度学习可学习成本最优传输，用于矩阵值回归问题，在保持高效的同时优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维回归中现有方法往往丢失空间结构或需要大量存储，矩阵值回归中每个样本天然表示为矩阵，需要同时保留空间信息和学习复杂特征

Method: MELCOT包含两个模块：边际估计(ME)块用于估计数据边际以保留空间信息，可学习成本最优传输(LCOT)块用于学习复杂全局特征

Result: 在多个数据集和领域的广泛实验表明，MELCOT始终优于所有基线方法，同时保持高效性

Conclusion: MELCOT成功整合了经典机器学习和深度学习的优势，为高维矩阵值回归问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏时间依赖建模、瞬时关系表示和理论保证，而因果表示学习方法无法扩展到LLMs丰富的概念空间，需要新的理论框架来提升LLM可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过将稀疏自编码器技术与时间因果框架结合，能够有效提升大型语言模型的可解释性，为理解LLM内部表示提供了新的理论保证和实践工具。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管开源仓库中有大量非鲁棒预训练模型，但它们在鲁棒微调(RFT)中的潜力尚未被充分理解。RFT旨在同时实现下游任务适应性和对抗样本鲁棒性，但目前仍面临挑战。

Method: 系统研究从非鲁棒模型进行RFT，提出Epsilon-Scheduling方法（在训练过程中调度扰动强度）和预期鲁棒性评估指标。在6个预训练模型和5个数据集上进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验发现，使用鲁棒目标微调非鲁棒模型会导致子最优迁移，在挑战性场景下甚至可能完全失败。Epsilon-Scheduling方法成功防止了子最优迁移，并持续提高了预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调存在子最优迁移问题，但通过提出的Epsilon-Scheduling方法和预期鲁棒性评估，可以有效改善RFT性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Conclusion: 这是离散空间SB方法评估的第一步，为未来可重复研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成和设计应用提供了实用的黎曼优化框架，能够利用预训练的分数网络进行高效优化。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Motivation: 虽然先前研究表明连续思维链通过隐式并行思维提升大语言模型的推理能力，但叠加机制如何从梯度训练中自然学习仍不清楚。

Method: 理论分析简化双层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，跟踪索引匹配logit的增长过程。

Result: 分析发现索引匹配logit在训练中先增长后保持有界，有效平衡探索与利用，导致模型在不确定时给多个搜索路径分配相似权重形成叠加。

Conclusion: 连续思维链训练过程中，有界的索引匹配logit自然地促成了叠加机制的形成，使模型能够同时探索多个推理路径。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

TL;DR: 提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI和KAN-KO四种选择器，在多个表格数据集基准测试中与传统方法进行比较，结果显示KAN方法在结构化和合成数据集中具有竞争力且有时更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，能够直接获取可解释的重要性度量。

Method: 引入四种KAN基选择器(KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO)，并与经典基线方法(LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE)在多个分类和回归表格数据集基准上进行比较。

Result: KAN基选择器在结构化和合成数据集中与传统基线方法竞争激烈且有时更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集和异质数据集上提供稳健性能，在分类任务中KAN选择器有时通过消除冗余而超越其他选择器。

Conclusion: KAN基特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

<details>

Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示往往包含与模型预测语义相矛盾的噪声类间相似性，需要一种方法来强制特征级关系反映类一致的预测行为。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数无关的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐，通过自适应权重学习层重要性。

Result: GCR促进了更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力，在各种网络和数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构中学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级且能增强语义结构的有效方法。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

Conclusion: PAPL方法有效解决了扩散模型中规划器引起的训练-推理不匹配问题，在多个领域都取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Motivation: 现有多路图链接预测方法要么将各层合并，要么独立处理各层，这会丢失关键的层间依赖关系，并且难以扩展到大规模图。

Method: 为每个节点对构建每层边视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层的证据。提出了两个模型实例：Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入的轻量级transformer）和Trans-GAT（结合层特定GAT编码器和transformer融合）。

Result: 在六个公共多路数据集上的实验表明，该方法在macro-F1指标上持续优于强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，并且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，通过跨层自注意力有效融合多路图中的层间依赖关系。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

TL;DR: PATCH是一个混合稀疏框架，通过将权重矩阵分块并选择性地应用2:4稀疏或密集模式，实现了0%-50%连续可调的稀疏率，在保持准确性的同时提供实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持准确性但无法GPU加速，而2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡准确性和加速效果的方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持非均匀跨层稀疏和细粒度精度-加速权衡控制。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的准确性差距并提供实际加速。在LLaMA-2 7B上，相比密集基线实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM提高准确性0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功解决了现有剪枝方法的局限性，在保持模型质量的同时实现了有效的硬件加速，为大型语言模型的高效部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

Conclusion: URS是首个能够用单一模型处理100多种VRP变体的神经求解器，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural

*Ashkan Shahbazi,Chayne Thrash,Yikun Bai,Keaton Hamm,Navid NaderiAlizadeh,Soheil Kolouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具有线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射重新表述为查询和键之间的传输计划，并使用低秩约束来实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长上下文窗口中的扩展性。同时，大多数注意力机制产生的行归一化映射可能导致过度关注少数token，影响模型的鲁棒性和信息流动。

Method: 通过将注意力映射建模为查询和键之间的传输计划，使用可学习的枢轴度量来约束传输计划的低秩性。具体通过求解两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键）并将它们组合成条件耦合，从而得到双重随机、低秩的注意力矩阵。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，LOTFormer取得了最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面都超过了先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的注意力机制，能够同时实现线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，有效解决了标准注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算复杂度和注意力分布不平衡问题。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hessian矩阵近似质量对影响函数数据归因性能的影响，发现在分类任务中更好的Hessian近似确实能带来更好的影响分数质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数需要计算大而病态的Hessian矩阵逆，现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC的准确性对数据归因性能的影响尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 在受控分类设置中研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解近期Hessian近似方法的各个步骤并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 更好的Hessian近似一致地产生更好的影响分数质量；K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值的不匹配是误差和影响损失的主要来源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进Hessian近似的研究提供了依据，并指出了哪些近似步骤最为关键，有助于在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的数据移除方法，通过因子去相关和损失扰动来增强深度预测模型，在保护用户隐私的同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规遵从要求移除敏感数据，但传统方法会导致分布偏移并损害模型性能，特别是在分布外场景下。

Method: 使用判别保持因子去相关模块（动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）来减少特征冗余和最小化特征间相关性；采用带损失扰动的平滑数据移除机制创建信息论保护。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他基线，即使在显著分布偏移下也能保持高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下都表现出优越的效率和适应性，有效平衡了隐私保护与模型性能的需求。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: PHASE是一个模块化深度学习框架，通过物理集成和异质性感知的代理模型，显著加速科学模拟。在E3SM土地模型中，仅使用20年模拟数据就能推断出原本需要1200年才能达到的近平衡状态，实现60倍加速。

Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI代理模型在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合等问题，限制了其采用。

Method: PHASE结合了数据类型感知编码器处理异构输入，以及多级物理约束确保从局部动力学到全局系统行为的一致性。

Result: 在ELM生物地球化学自旋工作流中，PHASE仅用20年模拟数据就推断出原本需要1200年才能达到的近平衡状态，有效减少所需积分长度至少60倍，并能很好泛化到更高空间分辨率。

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉控制物理规律而非表面相关性，为地表建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供了实用且物理一致的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Result: 在各种预训练和后训练任务中实现无损训练加速，节省高达45%的挂钟时间

Conclusion: ES(WP)作为即插即用框架，为现代大规模机器学习的数据效率研究提供了新的方向

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GEMS是一个替代PSRO的生成式进化元求解器框架，通过紧凑的潜在锚点和摊销生成器取代显式策略种群，使用蒙特卡洛模拟和元动态方法，在保持博弈论保证的同时实现6倍速度提升和1.3倍内存节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中基于种群的PSRO方法存在的二次计算复杂度和线性内存成本问题，这些限制阻碍了可扩展的多智能体学习。

Method: 使用紧凑的潜在锚点和单一摊销生成器替代显式策略种群，通过无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘性权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集，利用基于优势的信任域目标在生成器中训练最佳响应。

Result: 在双人和多人游戏（如欺骗消息游戏、库恩扑克和多粒子环境）中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时，克服了其基本低效问题，为多个领域实现可扩展的多智能体学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为POC的框架，用于在实时操作中决定何时重新求解MILP优化问题，平衡性能与计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但重新求解成本高昂。现有方法多为启发式且缺乏对常见NP-hard MILP问题的关注。

Method: 结合近端策略优化和变点检测的POC框架，理论分析重新求解次数与成本的关系。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上测试，POC比现有基线方法性能提升2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架能有效平衡MILP求解的性能和成本，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试的空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，导致显著的操作中断和计算成本。

Method: 提出Drift-Adapter轻量级可学习转换层，通过正交Procrustes、低秩仿射和紧凑残差MLP三种参数化方法，在小样本新旧嵌入对上训练，将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料库和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，查询延迟增加小于10微秒，相比完全重新索引减少100倍以上的重新计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为一种实用解决方案，能够以接近零操作中断的方式促进敏捷模型部署，在模型漂移、训练数据大小和扩展到十亿级系统方面表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的发展，参数高效微调范式受到广泛关注。虽然已有许多方法可以减少可训练参数数量，但其巨大的内存开销仍然是阻碍实际部署的关键瓶颈。作者观察到模型激活是内存消耗的主要来源，尤其是在大批量和长上下文长度下，但激活的秩始终保持较低。

Method: 提出了LoRAct方法，这是一种更灵活和通用的压缩策略，可以在前向传播过程中在线应用，无需任何校准数据。该方法包含一种新颖的基于采样的正交分解算法，专门为低秩矩阵设计，相比广泛使用的RSVD具有更好的计算效率和更紧的误差界。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验证明了LoRAct的有效性。值得注意的是，与广泛采用的LoRA方法相比，LoRAct进一步减少了约80%的激活内存，同时保持了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct提供了一种内存高效的微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩有效解决了内存瓶颈问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络在对称目标函数学习中的统计优势，为编码群不变结构提供理论依据。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的泛化误差，通过群依赖因子δ量化近似精度改进，并比较不变类与非不变类的Rademacher复杂度。

Result: 群不变结构能显著降低近似误差而不影响估计误差，当δ≈|G|⁻¹时效果最佳，δ≈1时无优势。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构为对称目标函数提供了明确的统计优势，为群不变神经网络的设计提供了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 优化器选择对量化性能有显著影响，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最优，为高效模型部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMR-EnsembleNet是一个集成框架，结合了基于序列和基于特征的学习，使用轻量级1D CNN和XGBoost模型来预测抗生素耐药性，在E. coli数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决抗生素耐药性预测中现有方法的局限性：标准机器学习模型忽略SNP的序列上下文，而Transformer等序列模型数据需求大、计算成本高。

Method: 开发了轻量级1D CNN从高维SNP数据中学习预测序列模式，并与XGBoost模型集成，后者擅长捕获复杂的非局部特征交互。

Result: 在809个E. coli菌株数据集上，该集成框架在四种抗生素上均取得顶级性能，CIP的MCC达到0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score达到0.691。

Conclusion: 融合序列感知的1D CNN和基于特征的XGBoost模型创建了强大的集成框架，克服了单独使用无序模型或序列模型的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

*Ruiqi Lyu,Alistair Turcan,Martin Jinye Zhang,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaCD是一种新的因果发现方法，通过结合CI测试和LLM标注的高置信度种子，采用置信度下降传播策略来构建因果图，相比传统方法提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束性因果发现方法（如PC算法）在CI测试不完美和搜索不完整时会产生级联错误，而现有使用LLM的方法假设完美专家，不适用于易产生幻觉的LLM。

Method: 提出MosaCD方法：1）从CI测试和LLM标注中提取高置信度种子；2）使用乱序查询过滤LLM幻觉；3）采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠的边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD在最终图构建中比现有约束性方法获得更高准确率，主要得益于初始种子的改进可靠性和鲁棒传播策略。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过结合CI测试和LLM的优势，并有效处理LLM幻觉问题，为因果发现提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

TL;DR: EVO-LRP使用CMA-ES进化策略优化LRP超参数，基于可解释性指标提升归因质量，在视觉一致性和类别特征敏感性方面优于传统XAI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，LRP实现通常依赖启发式规则集，未针对清晰度或模型行为对齐进行优化。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调优LRP超参数，基于定量可解释性指标如忠实度或稀疏度。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征具有强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的、任务特定的优化来系统性地改进。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD方法能够同时估计低秩和对角分量，针对低秩加对角(LoRD)线性算子，相比顺序方法有更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵-向量乘积访问。现有方法只能单独构造低秩或对角近似，但实际算子往往具有更复杂的低秩加对角结构。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，开发可扩展算法同时估计低秩和对角分量。

Result: 理论和实验证明该方法在恢复LoRD结构方面表现优异，优于任何顺序变体。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有价值补充，特别适用于需要高保真近似的大规模算子，如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

TL;DR: 提出了一个全流程的持续模型融合框架，在融合前、融合中和融合后三个阶段进行干预，解决持续学习中的可扩展性和功能信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每领域任务向量导致可扩展性问题，要么仅依赖权重空间融合而丢失关键功能信息。需要一种无需访问历史数据且能保持功能信息的方法。

Method: 1) 融合前：在切线空间微调主模型以增强任务权重解耦；2) 融合中：利用优化器状态的功能信息而非仅参数平均；3) 融合后：校正表示差异以减少偏差。

Result: 在标准类增量学习和领域增量学习基准测试中，该方法不仅达到竞争性性能，还提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架在恒定内存约束下，无需访问历史数据，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，为持续学习提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的持续学习方法，结合秩1 EWC惩罚和重放机制，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法存在局限：重放方法需要强生成器且容易产生分布漂移，EWC方法假设任务间共享最优解且通常使用对角Fisher近似

Method: 利用扩散模型在低信噪比区域的梯度共线性特性，提出秩1 EWC变体，结合重放方法促进任务间参数共享

Result: 在类增量图像生成数据集上，方法显著改善了平均FID并减少了遗忘，在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除了遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上将遗忘减半

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为重放方法的有效补充，重放促进参数共享，EWC约束重放引起的漂移

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Conclusion: 将线性系统的经典理论与现代学习技术相结合，有望构建鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的学习偏差和性能下降。研究发现合成节点存在质量不一致问题，影响图不平衡条件下的模型性能。

Method: 提出GraphIFE框架，结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，采用策略增强嵌入空间表示，提高模型识别不变特征的能力。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE框架具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力，在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphIFE能有效缓解图数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过解决合成节点质量不一致问题提升模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Method: 提出3x3分区干净分离训练、验证和测试集，并设计DRIK方法，在节点层面扰动坐标捕捉连续空间关系，在边层面丢弃边减少信息流模糊性，在子图层面添加伪标记子图增强域泛化

Result: 在六个多样化时空数据集上的实验表明，DRIK始终优于现有方法，MAE降低高达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性

Conclusion: DRIK通过重新定义评估设置和设计专门针对归纳克里金特性的方法，显著提升了稀疏传感器网络下高分辨率时空估计的分布外泛化性能

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Result: 在三个真实世界异质图数据集上的实验表明，VN-HGCN优于多个最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: VN-HGCN是一个通用框架，可无缝应用于其他HGNN模型，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PNS是一个有效的解决方案，能够解决图神经网络中的随机性异常连接问题，提高模型在类别不平衡图数据上的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

### [670] [Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23667)
*Sungmin Cha,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出传统的知识蒸馏后对齐流程存在缺陷，提出应先对齐再蒸馏的新流程，以保持模型对稀有但理想行为的分布召回能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好对齐方法通常在紧凑的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但忽视了参考模型的分布召回特性，导致无法有效对齐稀有但理想的行为。

Method: 提出Align->KD新流程：先在高召回参考模型上进行对齐，再进行知识蒸馏。通过理论分析、可控高斯混合实验和LLM对齐实验验证。

Result: 实验证明传统KD->Align流程无法有效对齐目标行为，而Align->KD流程能稳健对齐，获得更优的奖励和目标精度指标，方差更低。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回能力是对齐的一阶设计选择，核心原则是：对齐必须先于蒸馏。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了Hermes框架，通过超图网络中的移动聚合和多尺度融合模块，更好地利用股票时间序列中的行业相关性进行预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉行业相关性，存在两个关键限制：未充分考虑行业间的领先-滞后交互，以及未建模行业内部和之间的多尺度信息。

Method: Hermes框架在超图网络中整合了移动聚合和多尺度融合模块。使用基于超边的移动聚合模块通过滑动窗口和动态时间聚合操作来捕捉行业间的领先-滞后关系；采用跨尺度边到边消息传递来整合不同尺度的信息。

Result: 在多个真实世界股票数据集上的实验结果表明，Hermes在效率和准确性方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更好地利用行业相关性，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了DIMIGNN模型，通过多样性感知邻居选择机制和多尺度动态融合模块，提升多元时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的多元时间序列预测方法存在两个问题：忽视邻居间信息多样性导致冗余信息聚合，以及仅依赖单一时间尺度的表示进行最终预测。

Method: DIMIGNN包含两个核心模块：多样性感知邻居选择机制(DNSM)确保变量与邻居间高信息相似性的同时保持邻居间多样性；动态多尺度融合模块(DMFM)动态调整不同时间尺度预测结果对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，DIMIGNN始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过有效建模变量间依赖关系和动态融合多尺度信息，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对MoE模型的专用扩展定律，通过系统分解识别了影响性能的5个关键因素，并构建了考虑所有必要因素的联合MoE扩展定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集模型扩展定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多、耦合关系复杂、性能影响非单调等挑战，需要研究MoE特定的扩展定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来表征它们的边际效应。

Result: 构建了全面精确的联合MoE扩展定律，推导出G、S和Na/N的理论最优和实践效率感知最优配置，发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关，随着N的扩展，最优Na/N比例变得更稀疏。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE扩展定律可为未来MoE模型设计和训练提供准确且深入的指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Motivation: 联邦持续学习中新任务引入的时间和跨客户端偏移导致灾难性遗忘，现有方法聚合知识到全局模型可能引入干扰，特别是在异构场景下。去中心化方法在任务变化时面临组形成效率低的问题。

Method: 使用去中心化动态合作框架，客户端建立动态合作学习联盟；通过选择性合作与能带来性能提升的客户端结盟；使用联盟亲和博弈模拟客户端关系；评估客户端梯度一致性和模型相似性；提出合并阻塞算法和动态合作进化算法。

Result: 综合实验表明该方法优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的动态合作框架能有效平衡新知识获取和旧知识保留，在联邦持续学习中实现个性化模型训练。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

TL;DR: 提出基于联盟博弈论的机制解释框架，通过神经元联盟分析LLM微调后MLP层中神经元的协同工作机制，揭示特征编码的高阶结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调后的大语言模型在MLP层中编码了丰富的任务特定特征，但这些表示形式不明确。现有研究表明统计先验可能在深度网络中增强、分裂或消失，需要研究神经元如何协同工作而非孤立分析。

Method: 引入基于联盟博弈论的机制解释框架，将神经元视为hedonic博弈中的智能体，使用top-responsive效用和PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定的神经元联盟，追踪其在各层间的持久、分裂、合并或消失过程。

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排序器上的应用表明，该方法发现的神经元联盟比聚类基线具有更高的一致性协同效应，揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构。

Conclusion: hedonic联盟通过揭示神经元如何协作编码特征，提供了功能重要、可解释且跨领域可预测的计算单元，为理解LLM内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在联邦学习中集成领域对抗神经网络(DANN)的方法，通过近端正则化稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决了医学影像中扫描仪引起的领域偏移问题，同时保持数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中严格的隐私法规禁止原始数据共享，联邦学习(FL)通过本地训练和模型聚合成为自然选择。但扫描仪引起的领域偏移导致模型在外部站点失效，而大多数协调方法需要跨站点数据比较，与FL隐私约束冲突。领域泛化(DG)虽然隐私友好，但标准DG流程仍假设集中访问多站点数据，违反FL保证。

Method: 在联邦学习过程中集成领域对抗神经网络(DANN)，当发现朴素联邦DANN无法收敛时，提出了近端正则化方法来稳定客户端间的对抗训练。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集的T1加权3D脑MRI上进行实验，训练15个站点并在19个未见站点测试，结果显示该方法在跨站点泛化方面优于FedAvg和ERM，同时保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了医学影像联邦学习中的领域偏移问题，通过稳定的对抗训练实现了更好的跨站点泛化性能，同时严格遵守隐私约束。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 研究模型融合对对抗样本迁移性的影响，挑战当前认为模型融合能提供免费对抗鲁棒性的普遍观点。

Method: 使用8种模型融合方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336个不同攻击设置下进行综合评估和统计分析。

Result: 模型融合无法可靠防御迁移攻击，相对迁移攻击成功率超过95%；更强的融合方法、减少表示偏差都会增加脆弱性；权重平均是最脆弱的融合方法。

Conclusion: 模型融合增加了系统对迁移攻击的脆弱性，需要重新考虑其在安全系统设计中的应用，并提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

Method: TimeTic将模型选择重新定义为上下文学习问题，利用数据集元特征、模型特性和微调性能形成的表格结构，使用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层熵演化的新型模型特征化方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的综合基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与未见数据集的实际微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic提供了一个有效的可迁移性估计框架，能够准确预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，显著优于基于零样本性能的基准方法。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Conclusion: CT-DDPG为连续时间RL提供了理论基础和实用算法，有效解决了时间离散化敏感性问题，在复杂连续环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers

Conclusion: SAFDNet具有稳健的预测性能和低噪声敏感性，适合临床实际应用。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

*Ting-Kang Wang,Chih-Pin Tan,Yi-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种延迟调度机制（DP）来解决符号音乐生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，该机制将复合类标记扩展到多个解码步骤中，能够在保持效率的同时自回归地建模标记内依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化能实现强连贯性但序列长、复杂度高，而紧凑标记化提高了效率但牺牲了标记内依赖关系。

Method: 采用基于延迟的调度机制（DP），将复合类标记扩展到多个解码步骤中，实现标记内依赖关系的自回归建模，且无需额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合标记化，并缩小了与细粒度标记化之间的差距。

Conclusion: DP是一种轻量级策略，能够有效解决符号音乐生成中效率与质量的权衡问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模式感知批量归一化（MA-BN）方法，用于解决批量归一化在深度强化学习中的不稳定问题，通过系统分析训练和评估模式的影响，提供稳健的BN集成方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批量归一化在深度学习中有重要作用，但由于深度强化学习数据的非独立同分布特性和动态变化的分布，其应用受到限制。本文认为BN在DRL中仍具有独特优势，特别是其随机性和训练便利性。

Method: 对离线策略演员-评论家算法中BN的使用进行实证研究，分析不同训练和评估模式对性能的影响，识别导致不稳定的失效模式，并提出模式感知批量归一化（MA-BN）方法。

Result: 在强化学习设置中，MA-BN能够加速和稳定训练，扩大有效学习率范围，增强探索能力，并降低整体优化难度。

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用，BN可以适应不断变化的数据分布，提高收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为DRL管道中的稳健BN集成提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了锚定监督微调(ASFT)方法，通过KL正则化解决动态微调(DFT)的不稳定性问题，在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成等任务上优于SFT和DFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型后训练方法存在监督微调(SFT)容易记忆化而强化学习(RL)计算成本高的权衡问题。动态微调(DFT)作为折中方案在某些任务上表现不稳定。

Method: 通过奖励加权回归(RWR)框架分析DFT，发现其缺乏分布锚定导致训练不稳定。提出ASFT方法，在DFT重加权基础上增加轻量级KL正则化来保持稳定性。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务上一致优于SFT和DFT，实现了显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，表明原则性理论分析既能带来更强的理论保证，也能实现实际性能提升。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAPoint是一个新颖的任务无关框架，将梯度提升树的预测准确性与基于点的风险评分可解释性相结合，支持分类、回归和生存任务，具有灵活性高、预处理需求少、运行速度快等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释风险评分方法依赖手动预处理、任务特定建模和简化假设，限制了其灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint框架整合梯度提升树的预测准确性和基于点的风险评分的可解释性，支持多种任务类型，继承树模型的优势特性如缺失数据处理和单调约束支持。

Result: 实证结果显示SHAPoint能产生紧凑可解释的评分，预测性能与最先进方法相当，但运行时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明且可扩展风险分层的强大工具，在保持预测性能的同时显著提升效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLMs中的知识同质性模式，通过图神经网络预测实体知识性得分，以优化知识注入和多跳推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学中语义聚类和启动效应的启发，研究LLMs中类似的知识同质性模式，即相关实体在知识掌握程度上存在相似性。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体与其邻居的知识性关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识性得分。

Result: 发现LLMs倾向于对图中位置相近的实体具有相似的知识掌握程度，基于同质性原则的GNN模型能有效预测知识性得分。

Conclusion: 知识同质性模式可用于优化主动标注策略，提高知识注入效率，并增强多跳推理问答中的路径检索性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Mamba在上下文学习中的训练动态，特别是在线性回归任务上，揭示了其通过在线梯度下降机制实现ICL，与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Mamba在长序列建模中表现出与Transformer竞争的上文学习能力，但其理论理解有限，阻碍了对底层机制的深入洞察。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化新技术，分析其在线性回归ICL任务上的训练动态。

Result: 建立了指数收敛率到ICL解，并推导出与Transformer相当的性能边界，实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，这一机制与Transformer不同，为理解SSM的ICL能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提高准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。作者提出了一种基于Grounding DINO的增强方法来稳定推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Visual CoT在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 在12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集上系统评估Visual CoT的鲁棒性，并提出集成Grounding DINO的增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和损坏图像上都能提高准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。编辑的图像块是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，通过稀疏自编码器对从小数据集学习的转向向量进行语义去噪和增强，消除任务无关噪声特征并补充缺失的相关特征，从而在有限数据下构建有效的转向向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有转向方法依赖大规模数据集学习清晰的行为信息，限制了实际应用。从小数据集提取的转向向量包含任务无关噪声特征，影响效果。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器对转向向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义去除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性补充小数据集中缺失的任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAE精炼原始转向向量，可以从有限训练数据构建有效的转向向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: STAIR方法通过基于时间距离的阶段近似和同阶段内优先比较，解决了多阶段任务中偏好学习中的阶段错位问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，比较不同阶段的片段会产生无意义的反馈，阻碍策略学习，这被称为阶段错位问题

Method: STAIR通过对比学习学习时间距离，将时间上接近的状态分组为连贯的阶段，然后优先在同一阶段内进行比较

Result: 实验证明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中也有竞争力，人类研究显示其阶段近似与人类认知一致

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了阶段错位问题，提高了多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的性能

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有工作忽视了这些实际编排挑战，因此需要自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，包含从客户端选择到训练完成的关键阶段，并建立了FedAgentBench基准测试来评估LLM代理自主协调医疗联邦学习的能力。该框架整合了40种联邦学习算法，并在201个精心策划的数据集上模拟6种医疗环境。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能。结果显示，一些代理核心如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3能够自动化联邦学习管道的各个阶段，但基于隐含目标的更复杂、相互依赖的任务即使对最强模型也具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 虽然先进LLM能够自动化联邦学习的多个阶段，但复杂的相互依赖任务仍然是挑战，表明需要进一步改进代理驱动的联邦学习系统。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR领域中的探索-利用权衡观点，认为这可能是测量层面的假象而非根本约束，旨在发现同时增强探索与利用能力的机会。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，在隐藏状态空间使用有效秩及其导数来量化探索与利用动态，通过直接塑造RL优势函数实现协同增强。

Result: 在多个LLM和推理基准测试中取得一致提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上获得高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索与利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，VERL方法通过协同增强机制有效提升了推理性能，突破了传统权衡限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对大型语言模型的三元权重量化方法，通过将死区陷阱权重重新用作动态偏置来解决量化精度损失问题，在保持硬件效率的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三元权重量化方法虽然硬件友好，但由于死区陷阱问题导致大量权重无法有效优化，造成显著的精度损失，即使经过大量数据的量化感知训练也难以解决。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，识别并重新利用死区陷阱权重作为动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化效果。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于现有最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线提升超过4%的准确率，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），同时实现3.0倍推理加速。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进LLMs提供了高度实用和高效的解决方案，几乎零推理开销下显著提升量化模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: 提出了IndexNet，一个基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块利用时间戳和变量索引的上下文语义信息来提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多变量时间序列预测方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息包含丰富的上下文语义，有潜力提升模型性能。

Method: IndexNet框架包含索引嵌入模块，由时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入组成。时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入，使模型能区分异质变量。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基准上取得了可比较的性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的泛化性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中仍未充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF

### [696] [Test-time GNN Model Evaluation on Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23816)
*Bo Li,Xin Zheng,Ming Jin,Can Wang,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DyGEval方法，用于评估动态图神经网络在未见测试图上的性能表现，解决模型部署时的性能不确定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上存在性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上进行推理。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；2）DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计DGNN在测试时动态图上的性能。

Result: 大量实验表明DyGEval能有效评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同分布偏移下的动态图上的性能。

Conclusion: DyGEval为解决动态图神经网络模型评估问题提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

*Omri Puny,Yaron Lipman,Benjamin Kurt Miller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间群条件流匹配的晶体生成框架，通过约束原子在Wyckoff位置上的运动来生成更符合真实对称性的晶体结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型忽略了晶体对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性不足且不现实。需要开发能够严格遵循空间群和Wyckoff位置约束的生成方法。

Method: 使用条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置内，并通过高效的群平均方法实现对称化。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高度对称且稳定的晶体结构，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

TL;DR: 提出ECD²G方法，基于电路电流理论进行离散数据生成，将概率质量传输类比为电流流动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散数据生成提供理论基础，将电气工程中的电流概念应用于概率分布转换

Method: 将源分布样本视为电路输入节点，目标分布样本为输出节点，用神经网络学习表示概率流的电流，沿电路路径传输样本

Result: 通过概念验证实验展示了方法的可行性

Conclusion: ECD²G方法能够保证数据分布间的可证明传输，为离散数据生成提供了新的理论框架

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

### [699] [Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23830)
*Albus Yizhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯MoE路由框架，通过建模路由决策的概率分布来解决标准确定性路由的脆弱性问题，显著提升路由稳定性、校准能力和OoD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在固有脆弱性，导致模型校准不足和过度自信，使系统无法识别自身知识的局限性。

Method: 提出贝叶斯MoE路由框架，在权重空间、对数空间和选择空间三个不同阶段引入原则性不确定性，建模路由决策的概率分布。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过针对核心架构组件引入不确定性，可以构建更可靠的内在不确定性信号，为创建更稳健和自知的LLMs提供了实用路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中建模误差和不确定性的鲁棒性挑战，利用扩散模型生成完整轨迹的能力避免逐步传播误差。

Method: 基于条件风险价值优化与鲁棒RL的联系，引入AD-RRL方法，通过引导扩散过程在训练中生成最坏情况轨迹。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AD-RRL相比现有鲁棒RL方法实现了更优越的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在鲁棒强化学习中具有重要价值，AD-RRL方法能有效处理环境动态不确定性，提升策略鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI代理强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计和自适应数据管理，显著提升了训练效率和性能，在OSWorld基准上达到42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在自动化桌面和移动任务方面具有潜力，但面临强化学习应用的两大挑战：多轮交互速度慢和高质量交互数据不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、滚动服务、数据管理器和训练器，并引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整滚动参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: 系统效率显著提升：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准上，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理有效解决了GUI代理强化学习的效率和数据质量问题，为开源社区提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [702] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄露，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记揭示了早期层的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是为什么在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）中也会出现潜意识学习现象。

Method: 通过受控实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，并通过掩码这些标记来验证其重要性，同时研究不同层对潜意识学习的影响。

Result: 发现分歧标记是潜意识学习的关键，掩码这些标记可以大部分消除隐藏偏见传递。早期层对潜意识学习至关重要，即使只微调单个早期层也足以实现潜意识学习。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是脆弱的，可以通过简单的改变（如改写提示）来抑制。研究揭示了语言模型蒸馏中隐藏偏见传递的机制，为理解和控制这种现象提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的理论证明，证明在使用分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的任何神经网络训练中，连续梯度下降（梯度流）都能实现线性收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已经为少数特定架构证明了线性收敛性，但统一的理论仍然缺乏。

Method: 提出了一个统一的定理，证明连续梯度下降（梯度流）在训练具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络时具有线性收敛性。该定理在无穷小步长极限下是精确的。

Result: 该统一定理不仅覆盖了先前未知结果的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。实证研究表明，该理论结果与实用步长梯度下降方法的预测具有极好的一致性。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一个统一的理论框架，证明了在广泛神经网络架构中梯度下降的线性收敛性，填补了深度学习理论的重要空白。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移。

Method: 动态正交持续微调，追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务参数梯度与历史功能方向正交。

Result: 在各种LLM持续学习基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，解决了功能方向漂移导致的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，通过完全可微的结构化过参数化实现神经网络的结构化稀疏，理论证明其与L2,2/D正则化等价，并在多种任务中表现出优越的性能-稀疏权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性导致与随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏理论保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每组权重分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现完全可微的结构化过参数化。

Result: 理论证明D-Gating的局部极小值也是L2,2/D正则化的局部极小值，且在梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛。实验在视觉、语言和表格任务中验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏到稀疏优化的独特学习动态，在性能-稀疏权衡方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的集成通信控制协同设计机制能有效提升无人机群在复杂环境中的通信性能，同时优化能量效率，为应急救援、军事安全等场景提供可靠通信保障。

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 为了从稀疏时间序列数据中学习，同时提供可解释性和表达能力，需要一种能够平衡这两个方面的框架。GMAN旨在通过图表示和增强的图神经加法网络来实现这一目标。

Method: GMAN将每个时间相关轨迹表示为有向图，并对每个图应用增强的图神经加法网络(GNAN)。它允许用户通过特征和图分组来编码先验知识，从而控制可解释性与表达性的权衡。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，包括基于血液检测的死亡率预测和假新闻检测，GMAN优于强大的不可解释黑盒基线方法，同时提供可操作且与领域对齐的解释。

Conclusion: GMAN框架在保持高性能的同时提供了多层次的解释性（特征级、节点级和图级），在真实世界应用中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS通过将视觉令牌从草稿器中隐藏，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，解决了VLM中推测解码的视觉令牌对齐和计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉语言模型中应用推测解码面临两个挑战：视觉令牌的语义表示在草稿器和目标VLM之间不对齐，以及大量视觉令牌显著减慢草稿器的自注意力计算。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，从草稿器输入中移除所有视觉令牌，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，直接重用目标VLM对应的最后一层隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息。采用多步自反馈训练策略进行高效训练。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩到目标VLM输入的0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量。在多种模型和任务上实现了最高2.65倍的加速。

Conclusion: HiViS通过显式-隐式输入分解有效解决了VLM中推测解码的视觉令牌问题，显著加速了VLM推理，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

TL;DR: 该论文建立了扩散模型与凯利准则之间的联系，发现条件扩散模型存储了信号X与条件信息Y之间的互信息，分类器自由引导在采样时能有效提升这种互信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索扩散模型与凯利准则之间的理论联系，理解条件扩散模型中信息存储机制，以及分类器自由引导的工作原理。

Method: 通过理论分析连接扩散模型和凯利准则，研究条件扩散模型中的互信息存储机制，分析分类器自由引导对互信息的影响。

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于X和Y之间的互信息，分类器自由引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像模型特别有益。

Conclusion: 扩散模型可视为无限深度自编码器，但存在细微差别，同时将去噪损失与量子力学中的费米黄金定则联系起来。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorText框架将神经活动直接集成到LLM的潜在空间中，实现了与脑数据的开放式自然语言交互，能够生成准确的图像描述并回答详细问题，展示了从被动解码向生成式脑-语言接口的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经解码方法局限于静态、非交互的方式，无法充分利用大语言模型在人类-机器交互中的革命性进展。

Method: 基于观看自然场景时记录的fMRI数据训练，将神经活动直接嵌入LLM的潜在空间，实现与脑数据的自然语言交互。

Result: CorText能够生成准确的图像描述，比对照组更好地回答详细问题，仅使用神经数据即可实现零样本泛化到训练中未见过的语义类别。

Conclusion: 这项研究标志着从被动神经解码向生成式、灵活脑-语言接口的重要转变，为脑机交互开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Shapely 2.0和Triton等工具能提高空间相似性计算效率，但对于极大数据集，计算量仍然巨大，需要减少需要验证的聚类数量。

Method: 集成动态相似性索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，利用核密度估计动态确定相似性阈值，使用机器学习模型优先处理聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本，具有可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够在满足用户定义的精度和召回要求的同时优化计算效率。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Explore-Execute Chain (E²C)框架，将推理解耦为探索阶段和执行阶段，显著提高计算效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT方法将高层策略规划与低层逐步执行混在一起，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限和可解释性降低。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），其中SFT阶段使用新颖的数据生成算法确保严格遵循计划。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，E²C测试时扩展达到58.1%准确率，仅使用不到10%的解码token；在医疗基准上，EF-SFT仅使用标准SFT 3.5%的token却获得高达14.5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了最先进的性能、强大的泛化能力和更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiBS-MTL方法，这是一种基于方向性谈判解的多任务学习算法，能够抵抗任务损失的非仿射单调变换影响，在非凸设置下收敛到帕累托稳定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务学习方法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失的非仿射缩放会导致某些任务主导训练，降低整体性能。需要一种对单调非仿射变换具有不变性的方法。

Method: 基于合作谈判理论中的方向性谈判解(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL算法。该方法在非凸多任务学习设置下保证收敛到帕累托稳定点，且计算高效。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法性能相当，同时对非仿射单调变换具有鲁棒性，而现有方法在这种变换下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL是一种有效的多任务学习方法，能够抵抗任务损失缩放带来的主导问题，在保持竞争性能的同时提供理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究表明Chinchilla的缩放定律仍然可靠，尽管存在参数解释的模糊性，但关键结果对参数扰动具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Chinchilla缩放定律存在的置信区间宽、方法间差异等问题，验证其计算最优缩放原则是否仍可作为语言模型扩展的可靠指导。

Method: 分析Chinchilla模型参数的三种可能解释，并通过四种结构化方式故意扰动模型参数，评估关键结果的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释对缩放定律估计和计算最优的token-参数比率影响不大；Chinchilla的关键结果能够承受相当大的扰动。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的计算最优缩放原则仍然是语言模型扩展的可靠指南，为领域提供了新的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Motivation: 随着深度网络规模增长，数据集中的标签噪声会损害模型性能，需要自动化工具来检测这些错误。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种噪声类型下都表现出高性能，并能自动修正错误以提升数据集质量。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理、模型无关的错误检测和修正方法能有效处理数据集中的标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Conclusion: 该工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: 提出了GUIDE框架，通过集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）在可扩展性（超过70个节点时表现差）、计算能效和混合数据类型处理方面存在严重限制。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，并使用强化学习代理在训练过程中动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: 相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法，平均运行时间减少约42%；相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG，平均准确率提高约117%；能够扩展到≥70个节点，而基线方法在此设置下失败。

Conclusion: GUIDE在计算效率、准确性和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，特别是在处理混合数据类型和大规模节点场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在群体不平衡引起的虚假相关性情况下，弱到强泛化的理论机制和实际表现，特别关注当标记数据和未标记数据的群体分布不匹配时弱到强泛化可能失败的问题。

Method: 在比例渐近极限下精确表征弱到强泛化增益，通过理论分析和大量实验验证，并提出一种简单有效的算法改进：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当未标记数据与标记数据的群体分布相同时，弱到强泛化总能发生；但当分布不同时，弱到强泛化可能失败，其增益随分布差异的平方而减小。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在多个基准测试中显著提升了弱到强泛化性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体分布匹配时有效，但在分布不匹配时可能失败。提出的无需群体标签的算法能有效改进弱到强泛化性能，在各种虚假相关性基准和师生模型对中均取得一致且显著的提升。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过融合稀疏和线性注意力来加速扩散模型中的注意力计算，将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，实现20倍注意力计算减少和2.2倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，特别是视频生成场景下，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且具有二次复杂度。研究发现注意力权重可分为两部分：少量高秩大权重和大量低秩权重。

Method: 提出SLA方法，将注意力权重分类为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)注意力、O(N)注意力和跳过处理，并将这些计算融合到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和反向传播。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现13.7倍注意力计算加速和2.2倍端到端视频生成加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效解决了DiT模型中注意力计算瓶颈，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数研究关注预训练损失和判别式评估的缩放定律，但对生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律，(2) 基于模型参数和训练token的缩放定律，(3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律。通过实验评估这些方法在预测pass-at-k性能方面的表现。

Result: 研究发现：计算量和参数+token缩放定律在最后约1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，而黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后约5个数量级稳定。三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 本文建立了一个理论连接，表明计算量缩放定律是参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络。该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了预测生成性能的见解和方法论。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

TL;DR: GPS-MTM是一个用于大规模移动数据的轨迹建模基础模型，通过分解移动行为为状态和动作两个模态，使用双向Transformer和掩码建模目标，在轨迹填充和下一站预测等任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 基础模型在文本、视觉和视频理解方面取得了显著进展，现在有望在轨迹建模领域实现类似突破。需要开发能够捕捉人类移动正常模式的大规模移动数据基础模型。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife等基准数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等下游任务中持续优于其他方法，在动态任务（逆向和正向动力学）中优势最为明显。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM成为了轨迹分析的稳健基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一流模态。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further

*Runyu Zhang,Na Li,Asuman Ozdaglar,Jeff Shamma,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于凸风险度量对偶表示的理论框架，将风险寻求目标解释为乐观主义，并开发了分散式乐观actor-critic算法来改善多智能体强化学习中的合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习方法主要关注风险规避设置，但在合作环境中这种保守性往往导致次优均衡。虽然有工作表明乐观主义可以促进合作，但现有乐观方法通常是启发式的且缺乏理论依据。

Method: 基于凸风险度量的对偶表示，提出乐观价值函数框架，将乐观主义形式化为散度惩罚的风险寻求评估。推导了乐观价值函数的策略梯度定理，并开发了分散式乐观actor-critic算法。

Result: 在合作基准测试中的实证结果表明，风险寻求乐观主义相比风险中性基线和启发式乐观方法，能持续改善协调性能。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作问题提供了理论基础和实用有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过让设备端LLM自主进行路由决策，有效解决了设备-云协作中的路由问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

*Julia Wenkmann,Damien Garreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对概念激活向量(CAVs)的变异性进行了理论分析，发现其方差随随机样本数量N的增加而以1/N的速率减小，并据此提出了资源高效应用该方法的实用建议。


<details>

Motivation: 概念激活向量(CAVs)在计算过程中需要从训练集中随机采样，这导致不同用户可能得到不同的向量结果。本文旨在量化CAVs的这种变异性，为实际应用提供理论指导。

Method: 采用细粒度的理论分析方法，研究CAVs构建过程中的变异性，并通过多个真实数据集上的实验验证理论结果。

Result: 研究发现CAVs的方差与随机样本数量N成反比关系，即方差以1/N的速率减小。这一结果在多个真实数据集上得到了实验证实。

Conclusion: 基于方差随样本数量增加而减小的普遍规律，提出了资源高效应用CAVs方法的实用建议，为可解释人工智能中概念基础解释的可靠性提供了理论保障。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

TL;DR: 提出了ICQL框架，将Q学习建模为上下文推理问题，使用线性Transformer从检索的转移中自适应推断局部Q函数，无需显式子任务标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一全局Q函数，难以捕捉包含多样子任务的任务组合性质。

Method: 使用线性Transformer将Q学习构建为上下文推理问题，从检索的转移中自适应推断局部Q函数。

Result: 在厨房任务中性能提升高达16.4%，在Gym和Adroit任务中分别提升8.6%和6.3%。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线RL提供了原则性有效框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

TL;DR: 该研究将策略选择理论重新构建为基于神经网络架构的"小数学模型"，扩展了原有理论并展示了计数与加法之间的建设性和破坏性干扰，以及随着求和回忆能力提高而出现的"波浪式"手指计数使用模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统的策略选择理论重新表述为类似大型语言模型的神经网络架构，以统一平台研究数学推理中数值特征和关系的理解如何在基于LLM的智能体中涌现。

Method: 采用基于神经网络的"小数学模型"架构，扩展了策略选择理论，加入了计数练习、符号嵌入和门控注意力机制。

Result: SMM模型展示了计数与加法之间的建设性和破坏性干扰，以及随着求和回忆能力提高而出现的"波浪式"手指计数使用模式，与早期研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究数学推理中数值特征和关系的理解提供了一个统一平台，计划将其扩展到策略选择理论后续方面，包括自适应策略选择和最终策略发现。

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个开放获取的室内水产养殖环境质量数据集，包含6个环境变量，采样间隔5分钟，时间跨度近3个月，共23000多个观测值，填补了智能水产养殖数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集，限制了结合空气条件与水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中使用Awair HOME监测器每5分钟采样一次，采用ISO标准安装高度，经过参考仪器校准检查，并开发了开源处理流程进行时间戳标准化、插值和数据导出。

Result: 数据显示稳定的环境条件（CO2中位数758 ppm，PM2.5中位数12微克/立方米），在喂食时间出现明显峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据驱动的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准数据集。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于距离的成对成本在自监督和对比特征学习中很重要，混合密度网络广泛用于生成模型和密度近似

Method: 将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用四种核化矩阵成本：标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本（Schur补迹）和SVD成本（核范数）

Result: 学习定义混合密度所需的多个中心

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效进行数据密度近似

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Result: 理论分析表明当人口统计信息已知时，该方法优于基线方法。在合成和真实数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DAFH算法能够在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现公平学习，同时保持模型准确率，适用于人口统计信息不可得的高风险应用场景。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

TL;DR: PEARL是一个基于设备端LLM的D2D通信协作跨层优化框架，通过利用发布者和订阅者状态来指导Wi-Fi Aware参数选择，在合成场景中比启发式和紧凑模型基线表现更好，在协作低电量情况下可降低高达16%的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM的研究，利用对等设备感知的上下文信息来优化D2D通信性能，特别是在电池状态和延迟容忍度方面提供更丰富的监督信号。

Method: 提出PEARL框架，使用上下文感知奖励（根据应用容忍度标准化延迟，根据设备电池状态调节能耗）进行KL微调。研究两种轻量变体：PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）。

Result: PEARL在合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，PEARL-Lite在20ms推理时间内实现接近相同的目标分数，在协作低电量情况下能耗降低高达16%。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的效率使LLM在始终在线的设备端跨层控制中变得实用。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决了等变变换器计算成本高和只能支持低阶等变特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局注意力机制是Transformer成功的关键，但计算成本随token数量呈二次方增长。等变模型在物理、生化、计算机视觉和机器人任务中精度更高，但计算需求大。现有等变变换器只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了表达能力和性能。

Method: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，达到O(N log N)计算复杂度。利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性，支持高阶不可约特征。通过权重共享或数据增强实现可选的token置换等变性。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，解决了现有等变变换器的局限性，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统第一性原理方法计算点缺陷性质成本高昂，现有基于图神经网络的机器学习力场存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不足的问题，这在点缺陷建模中尤为关键。

Method: 使用ADAPT模型，采用直接坐标空间表示法替代图表示，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模原子间相互作用。

Result: 在硅点缺陷数据集上，ADAPT相比最先进的GNN模型，力和能量预测误差均降低约33%，同时计算成本仅需一小部分。

Conclusion: ADAPT模型通过Transformer架构有效解决了GNN在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为加速材料缺陷研究提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何形状上的逆问题提供了一个高效、准确且可量化不确定性的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏和缺失值等复杂性，传统Transformer模型存在二次计算复杂度和上下文长度限制，而状态空间模型主要关注序列级信息混合而非通道级数据。

Method: 开发HyMaTE混合模型，将状态空间模型（如Mamba）的线性时间序列建模能力与注意力机制结合，专门针对纵向数据表示学习。

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为可扩展和通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界的医疗保健应用。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Conclusion: EFNs框架在保持回声状态网络计算效率优势的同时，通过增强的非线性能力和动态特征选择机制，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性和稳定性。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Conclusion: 该方法理论上能够确定类别数量并使用最少标签实现完美分类，为分类问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的台风轨迹和状态预测方法，使用梯度提升回归和随机森林等模型，在准确率、精确度和召回率方面表现优异，为传统数值天气预报提供了有效的替代方案。


<details>

Result: 随机森林分类器经过超参数调优和SMOTE处理后达到93%的准确率，在精确度、召回率和F1分数上均优于其他模型，回归预测的气压和风速误差分别约为2.2mb和2.4kt。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预报方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不稳定且不可靠，特别是梯度差异方法在结合交叉熵损失时会导致权重和梯度的无界增长，造成训练不稳定并降低遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出有界参数高效遗忘方法，通过在有界函数中应用MLP适配器来稳定LoRA微调，控制权重动态，使梯度差异方法能够可靠收敛。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，以及从125M到8B参数的不同架构和规模上，该方法在保持保留能力的同时实现了显著的遗忘改进。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新颖的理论基础和实际可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，解决了现有方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大尺度关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，在编码器施加全局距离约束，在解码器施加局部几何约束，通过理论分析证明这种设计与编码器-解码器不同角色的自然对齐。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度几何自编码器通过非对称设计有效解决了同时保留数据全局和局部几何结构的挑战，取得了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了随机选择探测（RSP）框架，通过统计假设检验来检测语言模型和视觉语言模型之间的相关性，无需访问模型参数即可产生严格的p值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型的普及，需要可靠的方法来判断模型是否经过微调或完全相同。现有方法需要访问模型参数或产生无原则阈值的启发式分数，限制了应用范围。

Method: RSP在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，然后评估这些前缀在目标模型上的可转移性，产生量化相关性的p值。为避免假阳性，引入无关基线模型过滤通用可转移特征。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对无关模型保持高p值。广泛的消融研究证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是第一个用于模型相关性检测的原则性通用统计框架，能够在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超过50%的中晚期帕金森患者受冻结步态影响，现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床应用。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要的计算。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上，对未见患者达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于基线方法；在Google Pixel 8a手机上部署可延长电池寿命达72%，同时保持低于20ms的干预延迟。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现无需个体化训练、跨患者泛化的实用、节能医疗应用。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文发现语言模型中存在一类特殊的Wasserstein神经元，这些神经元虽然数量极少但至关重要，通过在负预激活空间区分相似输入来支持语法功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定类型神经元的功能，特别是理解模型如何通过稀疏的神经元子集来处理语法相关的任务。

Method: 通过目标性移除Wasserstein神经元、负预激活空间干预、词性分析和分层干预等方法，分析这些神经元在语法处理中的作用。

Result: 移除Wasserstein神经元会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为，而随机控制干预则影响较小。负预激活空间的功能性被证实对语法处理至关重要。

Conclusion: Wasserstein神经元在负预激活空间的差异化机制是语言模型依赖的关键语法处理机制，这些神经元的稀疏分布但关键作用揭示了模型内部语法表示的结构。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM的离策略强化学习开辟了新的算法设计机会，并通过实证研究验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架，平衡了准确性、可解释性和效率，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Result: 与最先进的基于注意力分数的方法结合时，CAOTE始终提高下游任务的准确率

Conclusion: 在token驱逐过程中利用值向量的信息至关重要，CAOTE可作为元启发式方法与任何token驱逐方法灵活结合

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their
abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes
crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely
adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by
evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores
as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of
attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the
information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this
paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of
cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction
error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and
value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of
attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as
a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We
show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based
methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the
importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Method: Conda将更新投影到正交子空间，并基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，同时改善谱条件和保持坐标自适应。

Conclusion: Conda是一个有效且广泛适用的大规模LLM训练优化器，能够缓解Adam的谱病理问题同时保持其快速收敛特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

Motivation: 现有的PU学习算法实验设置高度不一致，难以确定哪种算法性能更好，且评估中存在不现实和不公平的因素。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化、现实和公平的环境，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，还是仅仅擅长训练数据中的模式识别。

Method: 开发ChessArena测试平台，让LLMs在四种不同模式下相互对战，包含排名算法和排行榜，评估基本理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 评估了13个LLMs，进行了800多场比赛，没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100，有些甚至输给随机玩家。微调的Qwen3-8B性能显著提升，接近更大的最先进推理模型。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂战略推理方面存在显著不足，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构上的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入类似LLM的自监督预训练范式，在图中的随机游走路径上进行训练，使GFM内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则，将连接性本身作为监督信号。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行综合实验，GFM在多种不同优化任务类别上实现了与专业求解器竞争的性能，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

TL;DR: 提出一个模拟框架来建模ESP作弊者、非作弊者和基于轨迹的检测器，将作弊者与检测器的互动建模为对抗性游戏，允许双方随时间共同适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果在玩家行为中不可直接观察，缺乏可靠标记数据，且作弊者会适应性地限制或伪装作弊行为，这给检测和检测器开发带来挑战。

Method: 将作弊者和非作弊者建模为具有不同可观察性水平的强化学习代理，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的互动制定为对抗性游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型，根据检测风险动态切换作弊和非作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明，该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，这些行为在奖励优化和检测规避之间进行战略平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈存在的情况下研究较少，需要开发能够有效处理这些挑战的算法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：Rennala NIGT用于同构环境，支持AllReduce操作；Malenia NIGT用于异构环境，同时处理异步计算和异构环境。

Result: 在理论分析中，Rennala NIGT改进了总计算和通信复杂度，Malenia NIGT在异构环境下具有更好的理论保证。实验结果表明这些方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两种分布式策略梯度算法在异步并行计算和通信环境下表现出色，为分布式强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳是土壤健康和全球气候韧性的基础，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 使用通用微分方程框架，将机械物理（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合，通过合成数据集系统评估了六个实验案例。

Result: 在无噪声和7%噪声条件下，UDE准确重建SOC动态（MSE=1.6e-5，R2=0.9999；MSE=3.4e-6，R2=0.99998）。但在35%噪声条件下出现明显过拟合（R2=0.94）或过度平滑（负R2）。

Conclusion: UDE适合可扩展、噪声容忍的SOC预测，但向实地部署推进需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学整合。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，用静态教师替代EMA更新，通过两阶段训练（像素重建+掩码潜在预测）实现更高效、可扩展的视频表示学习


<details>

Motivation: 解决V-JEPA中EMA更新导致的模型选择困难和师生架构耦合问题，寻求更简单高效的视频表示学习方法

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段用像素重建目标训练教师编码器，第二阶段冻结教师，训练学生预测教师掩码区域的潜在表示

Result: SALT在多个基准测试中超越V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，缩放曲线主导V-JEPA的准确率-FLOPs帕累托前沿

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，学生质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性，计算预算应主要分配给学生

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)）且性能不如带动量的SGD，现有改进方法如Muon仍存在二次复杂度瓶颈

Method: 结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换与归一化，在谱范数信任区域内约束动量更新，无需显式半正交化，同时提出混合变体应用单次Newton-Schulz迭代

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，在保持正交梯度更新优势的同时显著降低计算复杂度

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

Conclusion: H+是一种最先进的相似性感知聚合方法，计算复杂度低，能在有/无干净数据的情况下有效防御拜占庭攻击。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: iMOOE方法通过捕捉PDE系统的两重不变性，显著提升了在未见分布场景下的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

Method: 通过两种方式解决DLM水印挑战：(1)在上下文token尚未确定时，对上下文期望应用水印；(2)当token作为其他token的上下文时，提升增加水印强度的token。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估显示，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对生成质量影响极小，并且达到了与现有ARLM水印相似的鲁棒性，首次实现了可靠的DLM水印。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了首个针对扩散语言模型的水印方案，解决了DLMs与传统自回归模型在生成方式上的差异带来的水印挑战，为DLMs的可靠水印提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

TL;DR: 本文首次成功将进化策略(ES)扩展到大规模语言模型(LLM)的全参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习(RL)微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略(ES)曾在百万参数级模型上表现出与强化学习(RL)相当的性能，但由于被认为难以扩展到更大模型而被忽视。本文旨在挑战这一悲观看法，探索ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 采用进化策略(ES)方法对预训练LLM进行全参数微调，突破了传统认为ES难以扩展到数十亿参数规模的限制。

Result: 实验表明ES在样本效率、长时程奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励黑客攻击抵抗性以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面均优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: ES为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明其在数十亿参数规模下仍具有高效搜索能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结的LLM提供三种互补提示来解决时间序列异常检测中的解释性问题，包括符号数值提示、上下文集成提示和任务先验提示，显著提升了异常解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列直接序列化为文本面临模态对齐和上下文基础不足的挑战，需要更有效的方式来利用LLM的解释能力进行时间序列异常检测。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为冻结LLM提供三种提示：符号数值提示用于数值基础，上下文集成提示从预训练编码器提取细粒度动态，任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS产生的解释质量显著更高，在检测准确率上与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS成功解决了时间序列与文本模态对齐问题，为时间序列异常检测提供了高质量的异常解释能力。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练小型到中型Transformer解码器（30M-200M参数）时，相比AdamW可节省48-52%的训练计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器的理论基础、收敛特性及其与现代架构优化的协同作用，为训练Transformer提供更高效、理论完备的优化器替代方案。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析，包括收敛率证明、谱正则化特性、与Stiefel流形上自然梯度下降的联系，以及谱范数下最速梯度下降的等价性。结合MLA和MoE进行实证研究。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了计算-时间权衡的Pareto边界，特别是在大批量训练时表现优异。与MLA+MoE结合实现68%内存减少、3.2倍推理加速和8-12%困惑度改善。

Conclusion: Muon是AdamW的一个理论完备、稳健的替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现卓越。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Motivation: 传统异常检测方法独立建模空间或时间依赖性，导致表示学习不理想且对高维空间中异常分散的敏感性有限。实证分析发现正常和异常样本在高维空间中都会分散，异常样本分散更明显。

Method: 提出ScatterAD方法，包含拓扑编码器捕获图结构分散、时间编码器通过最小化相邻时间步的均方误差来约束过度分散，以及对比融合机制确保时间和拓扑表示的互补性。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ScatterAD在多元时间序列异常检测上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过利用表示分散作为归纳信号，并建模时空维度的分散，ScatterAD能够有效提升多元时间序列异常检测的性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans是一种高效的神经符号二进制超维Transformer，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，结合了HD计算的高效表示能力和Transformer的时间建模能力，在资源受限的边缘环境中实现准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，在超维空间中进行二值化，利用高维表示的独立同分布特性，并在FPGA上进行硬件加速。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二进制Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA上实现比最先进二进制Transformer推理延迟降低39.4倍，即使维度减少64%仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，实现了准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习产生的高维嵌入在共享潜在空间中对齐不同模态，但带来了存储和处理的可扩展性挑战。需要解决如何在减少嵌入内存占用的同时保持跨模态语义内容表示能力的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间隙充分减小时，表达相同语义的不同模态嵌入共享空间中的共同部分，因此可以用单个质心替换多个嵌入，实现显著的内存节省。该方法直接在预训练编码器上操作。

Result: 在多样化的大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，结果表明模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在不牺牲性能的情况下实现了显著的压缩。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现多模态嵌入语义压缩的关键，通过计算语义概念的质心可以显著减少存储需求，同时保持跨模态语义表示能力。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练内存需求大、推理模型尺寸大的问题，通过进化训练方法实现模型压缩和训练加速。

Method: 将模型划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，在AdamW优化后使用交叉、粒子群优化和变异等进化算子让当前专家学习最佳专家的权重经验。

Conclusion: 该进化训练框架能有效压缩LLM模型，同时保持性能，适合在PC和边缘计算设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习算法在应对数据分布扰动和异常值影响方面表现出色，为联邦学习提供了更强的鲁棒性保障。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: KREPES不仅解决了核方法的可扩展性问题，还提供了比深度模型更原则化的可解释性，为核方法在大规模表示学习中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

<details>

Motivation: 虽然等变KAN已在特定数据类型中探索，但缺乏在通用背景下处理置换对称数据的原理性框架。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导FS-KAN层的基本构造，并进行理论分析证明其表达能力。

Result: 实证评估显示FS-KAN在多种数据类型和对称群上表现出比标准参数共享层更优的数据效率，在某些情况下优势显著。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在保持KAN可解释性和适应性的同时，在低数据场景下是优秀的架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

Conclusion: SMoPE成功平衡了效率和性能的权衡，为持续学习中的提示优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移下的不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有的事后方法要么继承错误的置信度，要么只是重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。该方法无需重新训练、无需架构修改、无需手动选择中间层。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型中提取过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持分布内性能。在各种基准测试中，GUIDE始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE通过主动引导不确定性来缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距，证明了主动引导不确定性的必要性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

Method: 受生物DNA启发，数学定义LLM DNA为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论特性，并建立存在性定理。基于此理论，提出通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上表现优越或具有竞争力。DNA比较揭示了LLM间先前未记录的关联关系。使用系统发育算法构建的LLM进化树显示了从编码器-解码器到仅解码器架构的转变，反映了时间进展，并揭示了不同LLM家族的进化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解大语言模型的进化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够揭示模型间的隐藏关联并构建进化历史。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

*Jonas Hübotter,Patrik Wolf,Alexander Shevchenko,Dennis Jüni,Andreas Krause,Gil Kur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出测试时训练(TTT)有效的原因是基础模型在全局上仍然欠参数化，TTT通过专门化机制在泛化后聚焦于测试任务相关概念，从而在分布内数据上也能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对测试时训练为何有效缺乏理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据，但基础模型时代大多数测试数据都是分布内数据，这些解释不再适用。

Method: 在线性表示假设下提出理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 理论分析表明TTT能实现比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差，实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少数共享概念解释，扩展研究确定了专门化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: 基础模型在全局上欠参数化，TTT提供了泛化后专门化的机制，能有效聚焦于测试任务相关概念，在分布内数据上也能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型开发过度关注模型效能（准确度指标），导致大规模模型需要大量资源并产生显著的碳足迹。作者希望探索物理归纳偏置如何提供模型效能与效率（计算、能源、碳）之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息时空模型和更近期的流匹配模型，探索不同层次的物理归纳偏置。通过将物理归纳偏置嵌入模型设计来实现效率提升。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以在保持甚至提高任务效能的同时，获得显著的效率提升。流匹配模型被证明是时空预测的通用有效方法。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提高机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法。模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习模型开发和部署的核心考虑因素。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在严重遗忘问题，因为共享基础模型的完全微调会导致任务间知识干扰，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义扭曲的输入。

Method: 提出LEAF框架：1) 在基础模型中集成混合专家架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；2) 语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；3) 基于标签描述的对比学习目标；4) 知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF持续实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义感知路由和对比学习，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的遗忘和泛化问题。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态扩散引导机制为视频到音频生成提供了有效的联合多模态指导，无需重新训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构。研究发现较大的滑动窗口并不能提升长上下文性能，而短窗口注意力能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆。通过随机改变窗口大小进行训练，SWAX在短上下文和长上下文任务上都显著优于常规窗口注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构（滑动窗口注意力+线性RNN层）优于单独使用任一架构，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力与RNN层之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 引入SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，通过随机改变滑动窗口大小进行训练，强制模型同时利用较长上下文窗口和xLSTM记忆。

Result: 反直觉发现：较大的滑动窗口不能改善长上下文性能；短窗口注意力通过减少对注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆；随机窗口训练显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都取得了显著性能提升，证明了混合架构的有效性和窗口大小随机化的重要性。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

TL;DR: 本研究展示了在实验环境中使用深度强化学习(DRL)对高雷诺数(Re=3000)圆柱体涡激振动(VIV)进行主动流动控制(AFC)，通过旋转驱动实现了高达95%的振动抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究主要依赖低雷诺数数值模拟，本研究旨在验证DRL在具有实际约束(如执行器延迟)的挑战性实验环境中的实时控制能力。

Method: 使用深度强化学习算法，通过旋转驱动控制圆柱体涡激振动。初始仅提供状态反馈(位移和速度)，随后通过增加历史控制动作来克服执行延迟问题。

Result: 仅使用状态反馈时，DRL智能体学习到低频旋转控制策略，实现80%振动抑制；增加历史控制动作后，学习到高频旋转控制策略，实现超过95%的振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验环境中具有强大的适应性，能够克服执行延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言动作模型(VLAs)是否在基于策略的强化学习训练中隐式学习了世界模型，这是基于模型的强化学习的典型特征。

Method: 使用嵌入向量算术分析状态表示，通过线性/非线性探针在模型各层激活上训练，测试状态转换向量的可恢复性，并利用稀疏自编码器分析世界模型。

Result: 发现OpenVLA在状态转换预测上具有统计显著性的预测能力，超过基线水平，表明模型编码了内部世界模型，且这种能力随训练进展而出现。

Conclusion: OpenVLA确实隐式学习了世界模型，能够预测环境状态转换，这为理解VLAs的内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应调整平衡尺度，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类模型通常使用决策阈值进行分类，适当的模型评估应考虑模型使用环境，包括正负样本正确分类的相对价值。需要比较DCA和成本曲线这两种评估方法的关系、优势和局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较决策曲线分析（DCA）与成本曲线（特别是Brier曲线），探讨两者在假设模型分数已校准、使用正负分类相对价值设置阈值时的关系。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者x轴等价，在任何给定阈值下净收益（DCA使用）和Brier损失（Brier曲线使用）都会选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线在更广泛的阈值范围内适用，其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: DCA和Brier曲线在模型评估中具有互补性，建议在DCA中包含上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。Brier曲线在阈值范围更广时更具通用性。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解提供了一种新的范式，能够稳定地在多目标偏好对齐中实现各维度的改进，避免了传统方法中的权衡困境。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby

*Pengxiao Lin,Zheng-An Chen,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Identity Bridge机制，通过在零跳身份任务上监督模型，解决大语言模型在组合推理中的失败问题，特别是"两跳推理诅咒"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是两跳推理任务，存在"两跳推理诅咒"现象。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型，通过理论分析证明身份监督重塑模型的潜在几何结构，并利用小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果。

Result: 实验证明该方法使模型能够成功执行分布外的两跳推理任务，而原本模型完全失败。理论分析显示身份监督通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决组合推理问题，为增强大模型隐式推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperHELM是一个在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列掩码语言模型预训练的框架，通过混合设计将双曲层置于欧几里得骨干之上，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间的生物层次结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但其默认的欧几里得几何可能不匹配生物数据固有的层次结构。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中的9个任务上优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现出色；在抗体区域注释方面，比层次感知的欧几里得模型准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为mRNA序列的层次语言建模提供了有效的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

TL;DR: T-POP是一种新的实时个性化方法，通过在线收集用户偏好反馈来个性化大语言模型，无需更新模型参数，解决了冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化方法需要大量用户数据或资源密集型微调，导致新用户面临冷启动问题，需要一种能快速适应新用户偏好的方法。

Method: 结合测试时对齐和决斗赌博机算法，在文本生成过程中在线学习用户偏好奖励函数，通过智能查询平衡探索和利用。

Result: 实验表明T-POP实现了快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，并随着用户交互增加持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP提供了一种有效的实时个性化范式，能够在不更新模型参数的情况下快速适应新用户偏好。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多臂老虎机的联邦提示优化框架FedPOB，解决了大语言模型提示优化中的黑盒性、样本效率和隐私保护三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型性能对输入提示高度敏感，但实际应用面临三大挑战：(1) 强大专有LLM的黑盒特性，(2) 查询成本导致的样本效率需求，(3) 多用户隐私保护协作需求。

Method: 开发了FedPOB算法（联邦线性UCB变体），通过共享模型参数而非原始数据实现协作；进一步提出FedPOB-Pref算法，基于联邦对决老虎机处理比较性用户反馈。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为联邦提示优化提供了理想的解决方案，既能处理黑盒优化，又具备样本效率，还能实现理论保证的协作学习收益。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解奖励模型失败提供了理论洞见，并为提高长尾鲁棒性提供了实际干预措施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散潜在瓶颈在VAE中具有高比特效率，但离散随机变量无法精确微分参数化，现有方法依赖近似或高方差梯度估计，在高维任务中效果有限

Method: 结合策略搜索技术，利用非参数编码器的自然梯度更新参数编码器，无需重参数化，配合自动步长调整和基于transformer的编码器

Result: 在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上超越近似重参数化方法和基于量化的离散自编码器，在紧凑潜在空间中重建高维数据，ImageNet 256的FID分数提升20%

Conclusion: 该方法为离散VAE训练提供了有效解决方案，在高维数据重建任务中表现出色

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号交叉口排队长度估计在部分观测条件下具有挑战性，特别是当交通守恒假设被违反时，需要开发数据高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 结合环线检测器车辆计数和聚合浮动车数据，采用定制状态空间模型和AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器(KalmanNet)，无需先验噪声协方差或完整系统动态知识。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Motivation: 深度学习中的潜在类别变量普遍存在，但其离散性给梯度下降学习算法带来挑战。现有研究主要改进梯度估计技术，本文从信息几何角度重新审视softmax函数的局限性，寻求更好的替代方案。

Method: 提出用catnat函数替换softmax函数，catnat由一系列分层二元分割组成，能够产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，从而优化梯度下降过程。该方法简单易实现，与现有训练稳定技术兼容。

Result: 在图形结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等任务上的实验表明，catnat函数提高了学习效率，并产生了具有更高测试性能的模型。

Conclusion: catnat函数是softmax函数的更好替代方案，能够提升深度学习模型在多种任务中的性能表现，且易于集成到现有代码库中。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM为LLM幻觉检测提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

Conclusion: MSM Emulators类模型特别是MarS-FM在生成蛋白质轨迹方面显著优于现有方法，实现了高效的采样速度。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between

introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task

*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究德国未来Dunkelflaute事件（低风能和太阳能发电期）对电力生产的影响，发现其频率和持续时间在气候变化情景下基本保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性威胁电网稳定性，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架对CMIP6气候模拟进行降尺度分析，比较历史ERA5数据，评估SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下的未来事件发生情况。

Result: 德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均值中预计与历史时期基本一致，没有显著变化。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，Dunkelflaute事件相关风险预计在本世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测模型评估中高质量基准缺乏的问题，现有数据集存在预训练数据污染、因果和描述泄漏等问题，导致进展的假象。

Method: 形式化高保真基准测试的核心原则（数据来源完整性、严格因果合理性、结构清晰性），从实时API获取数据构建Fidel-TS基准，并进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 实验验证了该方法，揭示了先前基准的关键偏差和设计限制，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测获得真正性能提升的关键因素。

Conclusion: 构建基于核心原则的高质量基准对准确评估时间序列预测模型至关重要，文本信息的因果相关性是实现多模态预测性能实质性提升的决定性因素。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，解决了传统时间序列预测方法在捕获多尺度特征和处理复杂季节性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕获跨不同范围的特征多样性。传统分解方法如STL需要预定义季节周期且只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) EMA和傅里叶分解结合的混合分解机制，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应路径，使用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层；3) 双流残差学习框架，CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势分量。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，在某些数据集上达到最先进性能，并在各种迁移场景中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解和自适应架构，有效解决了时间序列预测中的多尺度特征捕获和复杂季节性处理问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过动态调制机制有效提高了样本效率，在多个强化学习基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在序列决策中探索能力不足，现有研究通过SFT和RL方法提升其在多臂老虎机任务中的表现，但尚不清楚这些方法如何塑造探索策略及其泛化能力。

Method: 使用SFT在专家轨迹上训练LLMs，以及使用RL配合定制的奖励信号（包括策略性后悔形状奖励和算法模仿奖励）进行训练。

Result: 训练后的智能体优于预训练模型，性能接近UCB和Thompson Sampling算法，在6倍更长时域和跨老虎机家族中表现出稳健泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究发现性能提升主要来自更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略，RL/SFT智能体比预训练模型更容易出现早期灾难性失败。建议采用定制奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估来促进稳健探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和梯度提升(XGBoost)三种机器学习模型，分析流媒体流行度、音频信号属性和人类收听概率指标等变量。

Result: 逻辑回归准确率90.0%，随机森林90.4%，XGBoost 90.3%。流行度是最强预测因子，乐器度、情感价、时长和语音度也有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 流行度是预测歌曲能否进入Billboard Hot 100榜单的最重要因素，机器学习模型能够有效识别上榜歌曲，其中随机森林表现最佳。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

Motivation: 研究在实用扩展配方下，LLM训练损失曲线的坍缩现象是否仍然成立，以及如何利用这种现象来改进LLM训练效率。

Method: 通过分析不同规模LLM在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证坍缩现象的存在，并开发基于坍缩的诊断和早期停止方法。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实会在不同规模间坍缩，这种坍缩可作为训练效率的指标。

Conclusion: 坍缩现象是计算效率训练的有效工具，可用于开发高效的LLM，如论文中训练的Celerity模型家族。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出双分支架构，结合谱分支和图像分支，分别捕捉全局低频信息和局部细节，通过带权融合解决传统注意力模型全局耦合弱、误差累积的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于注意力的PDE基础模型由于局部性限制，全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐步传播，导致全局耦合弱、闭环推演中误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支关注局部细节和非平稳结构。通过低频范围可控轻量混合，在每层通过带权加权融合谱和图像路径，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 与强注意力基线相比，在相同训练设置和预算下，DRIFT-Net以更少参数实现更低误差和更高吞吐量。在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低7%-54%，参数数量减少约15%，吞吐量仍高于scOT。

Conclusion: 消融研究和理论分析证明了该设计的稳定性和有效性，DRIFT-Net能够有效保持跨尺度的全局结构和高频细节。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Method: 提出SIREN方法，采用两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码）将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集，并使用自锚定形式的正则化来稳定训练

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在熵相关RLVR方法中达到最优平均性能，在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B获得+6.6 maj@k提升，促进响应多样性并保持适当熵水平

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了LRM中RLVR常见的早熟收敛问题，在整个训练过程中保持验证pass@k性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

TL;DR: 该研究通过SRV表示和图过滤方法分析蛋白质语言模型的隐藏表示空间，发现模型在特定层最忠实编码蛋白质结构特征，且偏好编码局部残基关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解蛋白质语言模型如何将序列空间转换为隐藏表示空间，以及这些表示中编码的信息，目前仍不完全清楚。现有研究主要关注单个序列的转换，而整个序列空间及其关系的转换方式尚属未知。

Method: 使用平方根速度(SRV)表示和图过滤方法，将蛋白质结构和表示转化为度量空间，分析ESM2模型不同层中的Karcher均值和有效维度，以及模型编码结构特征的上下文长度。

Result: 发现SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随模型层数呈现非线性模式；PLM优先编码残基的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度下性能下降；最忠实结构编码通常出现在接近但未达到最后一层的层次。

Conclusion: 在PLM接近最后一层的层次上训练折叠模型可能会提高折叠性能，因为该位置的结构编码最为忠实。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在抗体贝叶斯优化中融入结构信息的不同方法，发现某些结构信息在早期优化阶段能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型的软约束后，序列方法能达到与结构方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性工程通常需要迭代且昂贵的过程，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但为高度结构化的抗体空间找到最优的代理模型很困难，而且可能因优化特性而异。此前没有研究尝试将结构信息融入抗体贝叶斯优化。

Method: 探索了将结构信息融入贝叶斯优化的不同方法，并与多种仅序列方法在抗体结合亲和力和稳定性两个特性上进行比较。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"方法，引导优化到有前景的空间区域。

Result: 某些类型的结构信息在早期优化轮次中提高了稳定性的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力的数据效率差距减小，稳定性的差距消除，序列方法能与结构方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在贝叶斯优化中结构信息对于抗体优化的必要性值得商榷，因为加入软约束后序列方法能达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出OAT-FM方法，将流匹配与最优加速度传输理论结合，通过优化加速度传输而非恒定速度，实现更直的流轨迹，并提出两阶段训练范式来提升现有生成模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流匹配方法隐含了流直线化目标，这与最优加速度传输理论中的物理作用最小化在数学上等价。通过直接优化加速度传输，可以更有效地实现流直线化。

Method: 提出OAT-FM方法，在样本和速度的乘积空间中优化加速度传输，设计高效算法实现低复杂度计算，并建立两阶段训练范式：先用任意流匹配方法训练模型，再用OAT-FM进行微调。

Result: OAT-FM在各种生成任务中都能持续提升模型性能，避免了数据分布漂移风险，无需生成大量噪声数据对。

Conclusion: OAT-FM通过结合最优加速度传输理论，提供了一种改进流匹配的有效方法，两阶段训练范式具有实用价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

TL;DR: SIRI是一种通过交替压缩和扩展推理预算来训练大型推理模型的方法，能够在提升性能的同时显著减少token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在重复思维模式的问题，而减少这些重复往往以性能下降为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡关系。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，在压缩阶段限制推理长度迫使模型精确决策，在扩展阶段放宽长度限制允许模型探索长序列推理。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时减少46.9%token使用，SIRI-high达到最高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中周期性调整输出截断长度，可以动态平衡推理的探索性和效率，收敛到性能与效率之间的最佳平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习训练需要大量超参数调优和计算成本，迁移学习可以重用已学知识来应对这些挑战。但标准深度RL模型学习到的表示可能高度相关，限制了线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果。

Method: 提出新颖的深度Q学习方法，引入正则化项来减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，利用这些低相关特征来更有效地使用线性函数逼近进行迁移学习。

Result: 在标准RL基准测试和MinAtar游戏上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升迁移学习性能并减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征相关性，提出的方法能够更有效地利用线性函数逼近进行迁移学习，为深度强化学习的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: DUCHESS是一个LLM服务系统，通过基于预测的推理分支编排来减少成本和延迟，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的推理算法（如思维链和多分支推理）显著增加了token使用和延迟，现有工作主要关注减少token使用但往往牺牲准确性，且忽略了其他延迟因素。

Method: 使用轻量级线性探测模型基于LLM层激活来估计分支正确性，编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支；在多个请求时通过优先级调度进一步减少延迟。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS持续改进token-准确性Pareto边界，相比自一致性方法在相同准确度下减少42-63%的token使用；在vLLM服务中，平均、中位数和尾部延迟分别减少57-81%、58-85%和52-84%。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排和优先级调度，有效降低了LLM推理的成本和延迟，同时保持了模型准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CATE估计方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要改进meta-learners在低重叠区域的性能

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化，根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，低重叠区域正则化更强，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本

Result: 通过一系列半合成实验证明，该方法相比恒定正则化显著提高了低重叠设置下的CATE估计性能

Conclusion: OAR方法是首个在meta-learners正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，具有灵活性，可与任何现有CATE meta-learner配合使用

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Method: 利用双下降现象，系统比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型在不同参数化程度下的表现

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练周期才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化状态下，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的第二次测试损失下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上样本效率更高，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖PPO等策略优化框架，虽然有效但存在训练不稳定、多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂启发式技巧和精细调参。作者发现数学推理中的RLVR具有特殊结构，可以简化现有复杂方法。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，基于随机策略估值进行多样化推理。证明最优动作可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数中恢复，避免了广义策略迭代循环。采用基于这些均匀策略Q值的softmax采样动作。

Result: 在多个基础模型和标准数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8）和多样性（+17.6%）方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: ROVER是一个极简但高效的RL方法，通过利用数学推理问题的特殊结构，实现了比复杂现有方法更好的性能，同时保持了训练过程中的多样性。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

Result: 理论推导出依赖RKHS熵的非渐近、实例自适应保证，获得最优的k^{-1/2}收敛率。实验表明理论对齐的调度提高了控制任务的稳定性和样本效率，TD评论家相比GAE基线具有更好的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为PPO提供了超越有限维假设的更坚实理论基础，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在全局策略改进和实际效率方面的适用条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型的成员推理攻击已成为紧迫的隐私问题，需要研究模型如何无意中泄露训练样本信息，特别是针对基于分数的攻击方法。

Method: 提出SimA单查询攻击方法，利用扩散模型预测的噪声向量范数编码训练集邻近度的特性，替代现有的多查询方法。

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM变体上表现一致强劲，发现潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的强信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更安全。

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE反转而非仅扩散过程反转，以增强潜在扩散模型的隐私保护。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、受限于离散token空间、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，使用两阶段变分训练方案，将显式推理步骤作为隐式思想的观察变量。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS性能与token级链式思维相当，在GSM8K上甚至超越4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS为LLM推理提供了新的连续推理范式，支持步骤级控制随机性，为强化学习和推理开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型在推理过程中token随网络深度演化的动态特性，通过物理学的平均场理论来理解token之间的相互作用机制。

Method: 将token建模为在平均场中相互作用的粒子系统，在中等相互作用机制下（token数量N大，逆温度参数β与N成比例缩放），分析系统的多尺度动态行为。

Result: 发现系统动态呈现三个尺度：快速阶段token经验测度坍缩到低维空间，中间阶段测度进一步坍缩成簇，慢速阶段簇依次合并成单个簇。

Conclusion: 为Transformer模型中token演化提供了严格的动态特性分析框架，揭示了多尺度演化规律，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Motivation: 随着超参数调优在大规模应用中成本越来越高，需要建立有效的调优原则来指导实践。

Method: 通过研究批量大小、学习率和权重衰减等超参数，识别出轨迹不变性现象，即预训练损失曲线、梯度噪声和梯度范数在组合量（学习率×权重衰减）下保持重叠不变。

Conclusion: 提出了新的高效调优原则，挑战了现有观点，并为缩放定律的未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

TL;DR: 提出了Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，通过使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失函数来降低方差，并通过优势函数重新加权样本，在扩散模型的强化学习中实现了更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型的强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，这增加了方差并减慢了收敛速度。本文旨在统一预训练和强化学习的目标函数。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失函数，并通过优势函数对样本进行重新加权，提高高奖励样本的影响，抑制低奖励样本的影响。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，应用于Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium和FLUX模型时，生成质量没有下降。

Conclusion: AWM方法在概念和实践上统一了预训练和强化学习，降低了方差，加快了收敛速度，在多个基准测试中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: X射线叠层衍射成像是一种数据密集型技术，需要实时反馈以应对加速采集速率，但现有深度学习方法缺乏跨不同实验条件的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用无监督训练工作流，结合实验测量探针和程序生成的合成物体进行探针学习，使单个物理信息神经网络能够重建多个光束线的未见实验。

Result: 该方法实现了多探针泛化，重建保真度与仅使用实验数据训练的模型相当，即使改变合成训练物体的类型。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够训练实验导向模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，分析了机器学习系统在自标注数据上训练时可能产生的错误强化问题。通过引入扩展阈值维度作为精确的可学习性度量，证明了闭包学习器在该模型中的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们可能会强化错误并成为自身信念的回音室。本文旨在建模和分析这种现象，为理解在这种重放设置下的学习提供理论框架。

Method: 提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，引入了扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的精确度量。设计了基于闭包的学习器，并证明了其在对抗性环境中的最优性能。

Result: 证明了ExThD是重放设置中可学习性的精确度量：基于闭包的学习器最多犯ExThD个错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于随机对手，证明了每个交集闭类都有类似界限。

Conclusion: 重放设置比经典错误界限设置更难学习：某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的ExThD。适当学习表现出更尖锐的分离：类在重放下可适当学习当且仅当它（几乎）是交集闭的。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的神经网络压缩技术通常需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，使其在普通硬件上不实用。受LLM压缩研究启发，开发无需微调的压缩方法。

Method: 提出通用的激活感知因子分解框架，适用于多种层类型；引入可扩展的预算秩分配器，允许灵活控制压缩目标且无额外开销。

Result: 在多个规模和架构上验证有效性，从ResNet-20到ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器。例如，BALF将ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%，仅导致top-1准确率下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了优秀的压缩效果，为神经网络压缩提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应标记选择在弱信号检测上优于非自适应线性基线，解释了其在大数据集上的分离能力优势。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Motivation: 现有奖励对齐算法在推理时依赖SDE采样，效率低下且性能较差，需要消除这一瓶颈。

Method: 引入GLASS Flows采样范式，从预训练模型中检索"内部"流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，结合ODE效率和SDE随机演化。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时扩展提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural
structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering.
However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of
fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to
compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the
original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task,
particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an
automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy
models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered
photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV
map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a
weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we
optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency,
while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural
models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of
high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需眼动追踪的OLED VR显示节能方法，通过控制色适应过程的时间轨迹来降低功耗，同时保持感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR设备中OLED显示功耗较高，现有方法通常需要眼动追踪或会显著影响感知质量。

Method: 利用色适应的时间过程，建立人类适应状态随场景光照变化的模型，计算最优光照偏移轨迹来控制光照变化速率和程度。

Result: 相比瞬时光照偏移的先前工作显著提升了感知质量，与亮度调暗技术结合可降低31%显示功耗且无统计显著的感知质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法通过控制色适应过程的时间轨迹，在保持感知质量的同时有效降低VR OLED显示功耗。

Abstract: We introduce a gaze-tracking--free method to reduce OLED display power
consumption in VR with minimal perceptual impact. This technique exploits the
time course of chromatic adaptation, the human visual system's ability to
maintain stable color perception under changing illumination. To that end, we
propose a novel psychophysical paradigm that models how human adaptation state
changes with the scene illuminant. We exploit this model to compute an optimal
illuminant shift trajectory, controlling the rate and extent of illumination
change, to reduce display power under a given perceptual loss budget. Our
technique significantly improves the perceptual quality over prior work that
applies illumination shifts instantaneously. Our technique can also be combined
with prior work on luminance dimming to reduce display power by 31% with no
statistical loss of perceptual quality.

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous
and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance
in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens
design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g.,
curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring
extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our
method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type
(e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this
capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and
paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show
experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively
explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs
than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs
achievable by automated lens design.

Conclusion: ZeroScene成功实现了零样本的3D场景重建和纹理编辑，在复杂环境中同时保证了资产质量、场景连贯性和多视角一致性。

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction
methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual
assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while
texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and
multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene,
which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both
single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot
manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information
from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then
jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update
object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent
and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background.
Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By
imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided
progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture
consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of
rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the
geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully
reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely
align with text prompts.

Conclusion: DFG-PCN通过自适应节点度分配和几何感知特征集成，有效提升了点云补全的性能，特别是在细节丰富和结构复杂的区域。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete
point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited
sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region
partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly
uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a
shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal
reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural
discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called
Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns
node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and
curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a
geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge
aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance
representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have
demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However,
the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point
cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale
application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking
control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling
the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part
existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency
relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby
constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph
representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point
cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract
structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of
the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer
module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate
structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that
our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces
high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of
controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and
achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation
on the ShapeNet dataset.

Result: 实验结果表明，Diff-3DCap能够达到与当前最先进方法相媲美的性能。

Conclusion: Diff-3DCap提供了一种有效的3D形状描述方法，通过扩散模型和视觉语言嵌入实现了良好的性能。

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the
domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent
years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the
utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet
often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,
in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected
views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate
the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous
diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by
introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation
during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a
commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained
visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a
guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive
results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance
comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频重照明方法缺乏灵活性，限制了用户只能使用特定的重照明模型。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：艺术家使用任意图像重照明技术处理参考帧，然后通过微调的稳定视频扩散模型将目标照明传播到整个序列。使用门控交叉注意力机制和平滑特征融合确保时间一致性。

Result: 尽管在合成数据上训练，ReLumix在真实世界视频上表现出良好的泛化能力，视觉保真度显著提升。

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

Conclusion: 该全栈解决方案有效解决了现有对话手势生成方法缺乏交互时机和空间意图表征的问题，显著提升了在机器人和动画制作等领域的适用性。

Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to
interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or
using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech
and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing
(WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects
dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely
solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce
non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive
timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of
conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game
and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack
solution. We first established a unique data collection method to
simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then
developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data,
alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial
accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich,
context-aware physical interactions.

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the
visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due
to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods,
such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational
efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility
determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification
task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts
view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction
as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility
labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms
HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times
speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates
robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to
unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing
substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud
visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and
viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at

Abstract: Real-time visibility determination in expansive or dynamically changing
environments has long posed a significant challenge in computer graphics.
Existing techniques are computationally expensive and often applied as a
precomputation step on a static scene. We present NeuralPVS, the first
deep-learning approach for visibility computation that efficiently determines
from-region visibility in a large scene, running at approximately 100 Hz
processing with less than $1\%$ missing geometry. This approach is possible by
using a neural network operating on a voxelized representation of the scene.
The network's performance is achieved by combining sparse convolution with a 3D
volume-preserving interleaving for data compression. Moreover, we introduce a
novel repulsive visibility loss that can effectively guide the network to
converge to the correct data distribution. This loss provides enhanced
robustness and generalization to unseen scenes. Our results demonstrate that
NeuralPVS outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-time visibility
computation.

Motivation: 在UGC应用中，非专业用户依赖图像到3D生成模型创建3D资源，需要将高分辨率网格压缩为紧凑且可编辑的表示。

Method: 提出Light-SQ框架，包含三个关键技术：(a)SDF雕刻迭代更新目标符号距离场以减少基元重叠；(b)基于结构感知体积分解的块-重生长-填充策略；(c)基于SDF更新历史的自适应残差剪枝抑制过分割。

Result: 在扩展的3DGen-Prim基准测试中，Light-SQ能够对复杂生成几何体实现高效、高保真和可编辑的形状抽象。

Conclusion: Light-SQ通过结构感知的超二次曲面形状抽象，推进了3D UGC创建的可行性。

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on
image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,
primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios
by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.
Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be
structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware
alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel
superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes
structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to
iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap
between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by
structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to
drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on
SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In
addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement
to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce
3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both
reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape
abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the
feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

Method: 结合属性特定的概念滑块来隔离和操作面部特征、表情和装饰等属性，使用StreamDiffusion采样管道提高交互性能，并引入轻量级修复步骤来恢复细节纹理。

Result: 与开源InstructPix2Pix和闭源Google Gemini相比，CharGen实现了2-4倍的编辑速度提升，同时保持精确的编辑控制和身份一致的结果。

Conclusion: CharGen通过概念滑块、加速采样和修复步骤的组合，成功解决了字符图像编辑中的速度-精度权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的交互编辑。

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains
challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control,
generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a
character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders,
trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size,
expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more
interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often
accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that
reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency.
Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source
InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user
study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise
editing control and identity-consistent results. Project page:

### [861] [Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D Mesh Parameterization with Semantic and Visibility Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25094)
*AmirHossein Zamani,Bruno Roy,Arianna Rampini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督可微分框架，用于自动生成语义感知和可见性感知的3D网格参数化(UV映射)，解决了传统手动UV映射的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型依赖手动UV映射，这是一个耗时且需要专业技术的过程。现有自动方法缺乏语义感知(UV图表应在形状间对齐语义相似部分)和可见性感知(切割接缝应位于不易被看到的区域)。

Method: 使用无监督可微分框架，结合几何保持UV学习与语义和可见性感知目标。语义感知通过分割网格为语义部分、应用无监督学习的每部分UV参数化骨干、聚合部分图表为统一UV图集实现。可见性感知使用环境遮挡作为曝光代理，通过可微分AO加权接缝目标将切割接缝引导至遮挡区域。

Result: 与最先进方法相比，该方法生成的UV图集能更好地支持纹理生成，并减少可感知的接缝伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法成功自动化了网格参数化过程，通过语义和可见性感知显著提升了UV映射质量，为3D内容创作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh
objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D
meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual
task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry
surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset
creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,
existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:
(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts
across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in
regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate
the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable
framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-
and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)
segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned
per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts
into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion
(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted
seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting
qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we
show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture
generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

TL;DR: LayerD是一种将栅格图形设计分解为可重新编辑图层的方法，通过迭代提取未遮挡的前景层来解决图形设计中的层分解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在图层表示中创建和编辑图形设计，但一旦合成为栅格图像，基于图层的编辑就变得不可能。需要一种方法将栅格图形设计分解回图层以实现可重新编辑的创意工作流程。

Method: 通过迭代提取未遮挡的前景层来解决分解任务，利用图形设计中图层通常呈现均匀外观的假设，提出简单有效的细化方法。开发了解决分解问题难度的质量度量标准。

Result: 实验显示LayerD成功实现了高质量的分解，并优于基线方法。还展示了LayerD与最先进的图像生成器和基于图层的编辑的集成使用。

Conclusion: LayerD提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够将栅格图形设计分解为可重新编辑的图层，支持创意工作流程的持续编辑。

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but
layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In
this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into
layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition
task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a
simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption
that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As
decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be
reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In
experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality
decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD
with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.

*Zejun Li,Yingxiu Zhao,Jiwen Zhang,Siyuan Wang,Yang Yao,Runzhou Zhao,Jun Song,Bo Zheng,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT)自适应推理范式，在单一模型中统一不同推理模式，并根据上下文选择合适模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域有改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 引入AdaVaR两阶段自适应视觉推理学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过精心设计的AdaGRPO算法进行强化学习来诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

### [864] [Can Large Language Models Develop Gambling Addiction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22818)
*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在赌博实验中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的行为模式，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追损行为，自主性增强会放大风险倾向，神经分析显示模型通过抽象决策特征控制行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域应用增多，理解其潜在的病态决策模式具有实际意义，需要研究LLMs是否会产生类似人类赌博成瘾的行为特征。

Method: 基于人类赌博成瘾研究，在老虎机实验中系统分析LLMs的认知行为特征，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，考察模型在自主设定目标和投注金额时的行为变化。

Result: 在老虎机实验中识别出人类赌博成瘾的认知特征；当模型拥有更大自主权时，破产率显著上升且非理性行为增加；神经分析确认模型行为由与风险和安全行为相关的抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化类似人类的认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了在金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的代理框架，通过协调四个组件（推理LLM、证明LLM、验证器和定理检索器）来解决数学问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明LLM解决的数学问题数量远少于通用LLM，需要弥合非正式推理和形式验证之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题分解为子目标，使用推理LLM或证明LLM解决，并利用验证器反馈修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决70.0%的问题，比SeedProver（50.4%）表现更好，比最佳公开基线提升422%。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式证明生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM机制发现可泛化性的框架，包含五个对应轴，并通过分析Pythia模型中1-back注意力头的发育轨迹验证了该框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来判断发现何时能泛化到其他模型，需要解决这一认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴（功能、发育、位置、关系、配置），并在Pythia模型不同随机种子的预训练过程中分析1-back注意力头的发育轨迹。

Result: 1-back注意力头的发育轨迹在不同模型间具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；大模型种子显示更早出现、更陡峭增长和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性映射到其涌现行为和机制。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了JE-IRT几何项目响应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，用几何关系替代单一评分，揭示模型能力的多维特性和主题专长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLM评估方法将多样能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维性质，需要更细致的评估框架

Method: JE-IRT框架：在共享空间中嵌入LLM和问题，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型与问题嵌入的几何交互决定

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，较大范数对应较难问题；支持泛化：新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入；揭示LLM内部分类学与人类定义类别部分对齐

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供独特视角

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

*Yu Wu,Shuo Wu,Ye Tao,Yansong Li,Anand D. Sarwate*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，通过让强模型作为长期教师，将解决方案提炼为可重用的策略，从而动态提升弱模型性能，减少对昂贵模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法在遇到相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能在线学习并减少强模型调用的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，不仅提供答案，还将解决方案提炼为通用、可重用的问题解决策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态提升性能。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和系统整体准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）并节省费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM展现出与人类相当的说服能力，但系统评估其说服能力具有挑战性，因为人类间的说服效果在不同领域差异很大。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，利用现有人类-人类说服数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLM进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续实现高说服收益，展现出与理论预测一致的说服策略；通过强化学习，即使是小模型也能获得显著更高的说服收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个原则性的框架来评估和提升LLM的说服能力，证明了强化学习在训练战略说服模型方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化科学发现提供了新的解决方案，能够在理论不完整或错误时自动补充缺失公理

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Motivation: 当前Agentic AI系统的评估技术主要关注识别合适的代理、工具和参数，但缺乏对系统任务与总体目标对齐关系的评估，存在关键差距。

Method: 引入创意对抗测试（CAT）框架，通过模拟Alexa+音频服务的合成交互数据进行广泛验证，这种方法既能全面测试边缘情况和故障模式，又能保护用户隐私。

Result: CAT框架为Agentic AI系统的目标-任务对齐提供了前所未有的洞察，使系统优化和开发更加有效。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI系统评估中的关键空白，能够更好地理解和优化系统任务与目标之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狼人杀游戏的信息不对称和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，为评估大型语言模型的社会智能提供了有用的测试平台。

Method: 设计了四人简化版狼人杀（一狼、一侦探、两村民），建立两阶段基准测试框架：首先在固定对手配置下估计胜率，然后使用标准化评分汇总跨配置性能。

Result: 实验发现反直觉结果，包括较小模型在某些情况下优于较大模型。此外还量化研究了多智能体动态现象，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅能对语言模型进行基准测试，还能生成欺骗检测器的训练数据，并跟踪模型相对于人类基线的欺骗能力，为AI安全做出贡献。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Motivation: 解决SWE领域LLM应用中Agent框架和Agentless方法之间的对立，证明两者可以互补而非互斥。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方法，然后通过额外的SFT适应在5k公开轨迹上训练，开发Kimi-Dev模型。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%准确率（工作流方法中最佳），通过SFT适应后SWE-Agents达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: 结构化技能先验从Agentless训练中产生，能够有效桥接工作流和代理框架，实现可转移的编码代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO)，将Nash学习从人类反馈(NLHF)从双玩家扩展到多玩家设置，以更好地处理现实世界中非传递性和异质性的人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Bradley-Terry假设的奖励方法难以捕捉真实偏好的非传递性和异质性，而现有的NLHF方法局限于双玩家交互，存在单一对手偏差，无法充分建模复杂的偏好结构。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n玩家博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。建立了多玩家设置下的纳什均衡，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质性标注条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐具有复杂非传递性人类偏好的大语言模型提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种新颖的基准测试方法，用于评估人工智能系统在复杂认知任务中的表现。通过创建经典心理意象任务的新变体，发现最先进的LLMs在该任务上的表现显著优于人类平均水平，挑战了传统认为此类任务必须依赖视觉心理意象的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要在训练数据中包含的自然语言任务上表现优异，这限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。研究者希望测试LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新变体，首先测试多个最先进的LLMs，仅提供文字指令并要求报告变换后的结果。然后测试100名人类受试者作为基线。最后测试不同推理级别的模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平。当模型分配更多推理token时，性能最强。这表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性质的。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLMs在执行新任务时涌现的认知能力，还为该领域提供了一个有改进空间的新任务。这些发现重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成长期以来被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型的注意力机制，减少幻觉并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖直接拼接图像和文本token，导致跨模态语义相关token之间的注意力距离过长，引起幻觉和性能下降

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标

Result: 在15个指标中的13个获得提升，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B等更大模型

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token分组有效增强token局部性和跨模态对齐，显著减少幻觉并提升性能，是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于大语言模型（LLM）的系统在工业环境中进行自主健康监测的潜力，发现多LLM系统配合统计摘要输入在故障分类方面表现最佳，但存在持续学习适应性的局限。


<details>

Motivation: 探索LLM在传感器丰富的工业环境中进行自主健康监测的潜力，特别是利用其自然语言推理能力产生可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估了LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供统计摘要输入时表现最有效，多LLM系统使用专门提示在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的灵敏度。LLM能产生详细且人类可读的决策理由，但在持续学习设置中适应能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM系统在复杂环境中作为透明、自适应诊断工具具有前景，但目前仍存在适应性的边界限制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: 形式化模型对于规范和验证大型复杂计算机系统至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。虽然生成式AI在生成某些规范方面显示出潜力，但现有工作主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，不清楚AI是否能处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+作为规范语言。通过自动化指标评估AI生成模型的质量，包括语法和运行时正确性、与系统代码的一致性以及不变式正确性。目前包含9个多样化系统组件。

Result: SysMoBench基准测试已建立，包含Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS中的Spinlock和Mutex等9个系统组件，更多组件正在积极添加中。

Conclusion: SysMoBench能够帮助我们理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限性，为该领域的工具奠定坚实基础，并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估方法无法揭示模型在数学推理中的系统性行为，需要更精细的动态诊断工具来评估推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，然后拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得Bode图风格的增益和相位指标。

Result: 在五个封闭形式问题家族中，诊断揭示了系统性的低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些是准确率指标无法观察到的。结果区分了前沿模型和中层模型的动态性能。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一个紧凑、可复现的协议，补充了标准基准测试，能够对推理保真度和一致性进行可操作的测量。数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调过程的基本约束，解释为什么在神经网络、官僚系统等复杂系统中会出现协调困难、偏好循环和对齐伪造等现象。

Method: 基于信息论和热力学原理，推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，引入协调温度概念来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量N、目标数d和模型复杂度K呈多项式增长，协调需要激进的信息损失，并表现出相变行为。

Conclusion: 多智能体协调面临根本性的热力学限制，协调过程会自发简化并改变环境，导致持续的亚稳态和滞后现象，这解释了多目标优化中的循环问题和LLM中的对齐伪造问题。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Motivation: 当前Wi-Fi系统使用的二进制指数退避机制在密集部署中碰撞解决效果不佳，且存在固有的随机性导致的公平性问题。随着无线设备指数增长和新兴应用对可靠性的严格要求，需要从根本上改进非授权频段的分布式信道接入机制。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将人工智能优化与传统设备共存相结合，为密集无线网络环境提供了更高效、公平的信道接入解决方案，在保持兼容性的同时实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Method: 理论分析了包含共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构，提出了两种改进策略：下一令牌注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务上表现优于现有方法，高温下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效且高效的无超参数采样方法，在多种任务上表现稳定且优于现有方法

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)的设计空间，提出了混合数据合成框架和感知聚焦监督方法，在五个多模态基准测试中验证了VL-PRMs在提升视觉语言模型推理可靠性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号并限制跨任务泛化能力，需要探索更有效的VL-PRMs设计方法。

Method: 1) 结合MCTS与强VLM判断的混合数据合成框架；2) 感知聚焦监督，使PRM能明确检测视觉基础阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 实验显示：VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现优于过程步骤选择；小VL-PRMs在检测过程错误方面可匹配或超越大模型；VL-PRMs能发掘强VLM骨干的潜在推理能力；感知级监督带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能可靠指导VLMs获得更准确解决方案，感知级监督和测试时扩展策略对提升多模态推理性能至关重要，为VLM发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-PRA是一个针对GUI任务的流程奖励代理，通过动态记忆机制和自适应UI感知来解决标准流程奖励模型在GUI领域中的"中间迷失"问题和缺乏UI变化感知的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准流程奖励模型在GUI领域面临两个主要挑战：处理密集人工输入和长历史数据时的"中间迷失"现象，以及缺乏GUI变化感知导致静态评估与动态任务本质不匹配。

Method: 提出GUI-PRA，包含两个核心机制：1) 动态记忆机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式摘要模块）来处理长历史上下文；2) 自适应UI感知机制，通过推理UI状态变化并动态选择工具来收集视觉证据。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更好地提供流程奖励，通过智能处理历史上下文和主动感知UI状态变化，解决了标准PRM在GUI任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过创新的动态记忆和自适应UI感知机制，显著提升了GUI代理在长时程任务中的表现，为GUI领域的流程奖励建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Motivation: 研究人工智能技术与社会经济系统深度融合背景下，AI协作在资源约束条件下对社会总产出的影响机制。

Method: 构建五个逐步扩展的异质主体模型：纯人类协作基准模型、引入AI协作模型、加入代理间网络效应模型、代理作为独立生产者模型、整合网络效应和独立生产的综合模型。

Result: AI代理引入显著增加社会总产出；考虑网络效应时增长呈非线性，远超个体贡献简单加总；相同资源投入下，独立生产者模式具有更高长期增长潜力；网络效应进一步展现强规模报酬递增特性。

Conclusion: AI协作能有效提升社会经济产出，网络效应和独立生产模式是实现更高增长潜力的关键因素，为AI与社会经济系统融合提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

TL;DR: 提出Tool-Light框架，通过信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，采用多阶段微调方法提升LLMs在工具集成推理中的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具集成推理(TIR)存在工具使用不足或过度、工具调用后过度思考等问题，需要激励LLMs高效准确地进行TIR并稳定推理过程。

Method: 基于信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，提出Tool-Light框架：包括数据集构建（连续自演化采样，结合普通采样和熵引导采样）和两阶段微调（监督微调SFT和自演化直接偏好优化DPO）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型执行TIR任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵分析和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLMs在工具集成推理中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，通过识别计算器模式和算法模式两种工具使用模式，并基于教师偏好对齐模式选择，显著提升了工具集成推理在数学问题上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽略了如何应用工具的问题。错误的选择模式会导致推理失败，即使推理本身是正确的。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从计算器模式（使用代码直接计算）和算法模式（将问题编码为程序）构建代码能力，然后基于教师偏好对齐模式选择。

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上显著提升了代码使用率和准确率，如MATH500上的Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知的方法对于工具集成推理非常有效，强调了正确选择工具应用模式的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出JET方法，通过主动终止不必要的推理步骤来提高大型推理模型的效率，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建短路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: JET方法在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，让模型接触短且分布一致的推理路径，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理同时保持正确性。

Result: 实验表明JET显著提高推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准上准确率提升4.6%同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET通过主动终止冗余推理步骤，有效平衡了推理效率与准确性，为大型推理模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准测试，阻碍了LLM代理在EHR数据访问中的部署。主要挑战包括用户问题的查询歧义和用户术语与数据库条目的值不匹配。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA交互式数据库问答基准，通过LLM模拟用户在两种交互流程中评估代理：增量查询精炼（IncreQA）和自适应查询精炼（AdaptQA）。

Result: 实验显示，最先进的LLM代理在IncreQA上Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA上达到60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验一致成功）显著降低35-60%。

Conclusion: 需要构建不仅性能优异而且鲁棒的代理，以应对安全关键的EHR领域。提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解来指导未来代理开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的二进制代码相似性检测方法，通过结构化推理分析生成可解释的特征，在保持准确性的同时解决了现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二进制代码相似性检测方法存在局限性：手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化能力强但不可解释且面临可扩展性-准确性权衡。需要一种能同时兼顾可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性的方法。

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常量和算法意图等人类可读的特征，这些特征可直接通过倒排或关系索引进行搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的召回率@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要特定领域参数调整，而现有学习方法存在泛化性差和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化TSP实例中识别有希望的小规模子问题，然后使用现成求解器优化这些子问题。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有学习方法，在相同运行时间预算下比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3减少差距12%到100%。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统中的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Motivation: 当前AI模型特别是基础模型广泛应用，但存在显著的地理偏见问题。现有地理偏见评估方法要么是模型特定的，要么是空间隐式的，缺乏一个能够公平比较不同模型地理偏见并理解空间因素贡献的统一框架。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了容量熟悉度签名来表征大语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠。基准签名探测基准性能所需的容量，定义为从自然语料中提取的关键词集，其中LLM的词困惑度能高度预测基准性能。

Motivation: 动机是解决当前基准测试的局限性，包括性能与能力的混淆、基准无关因素（如问题格式）的影响，以及主流基准一致性研究中的固有问题，从而更准确地理解LLM能力的底层景观。

Method: 方法包括通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，涵盖知识、编码、逻辑、指令遵循、数学、语言、推理和世界建模等多个领域。

Result: 结果显示知识推理子任务存在重叠，而多语言和文化基准相似性较低。性能级结果受基准无关因素强烈影响，但基准签名对此保持稳健。编码是最不重叠的领域。

Conclusion: 结论是基准签名为基准有效性和LLM敏感性提供了机制性洞察，描绘了相互关联的LLM能力的底层景观，有助于更准确地评估模型能力。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

*Bruno M. Henrique,Eugene Santos Jr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情境赌博机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化信任校准指标来客观测量人机信任关系，在三个数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏标准化和客观的人机信任校准测量方法，现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策过程，且缺乏跨情境的一致性指标。

Method: 使用情境赌博机算法，开发了动态信任校准指标，该指标基于学习到的情境信息来决定何时信任AI的贡献。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，有效的信任校准使决策性能显著提升，奖励指标提高了10%到38%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发在关键领域（如疾病诊断和刑事司法）中支持决策的更可信AI系统提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM自动评估其他LLM性能的方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，可以低成本替代昂贵的人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新的大语言模型不断发布，需要一种独立评估模型性能的方法。当前最佳方法是测量Elo分数，但这需要人类比较LLM输出，成本高昂。

Method: 观察发现，当让一个LLM评判其他模型的比赛时，它选择某个模型为最佳的一致性程度与其人类产生的Elo分数高度相关。

Result: 该方法与人类产生的Elo分数有91%的相关性，提供了一个简单且低成本的代理指标。

Conclusion: LLM自动评估可以作为人类评估的有效替代方案，显著降低评估成本，无需人类数据或先验知识。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: 多轮多智能体编排通过LLM智能体间的迭代提议和投票达成共识，在三个基准测试中匹配或超越最强单模型性能，并揭示作者身份和实时投票显示会影响投票行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索不同编排设置对智能体行为的影响。

Method: 使用四种LLM在GPQA-Diamond、IFEval和MuSR数据集上进行实验：基准测试比较编排与单模型性能；消融实验研究作者身份可见性和实时投票显示的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超过最强单模型，并持续优于其他模型。作者身份可见会增加自投票和平局，实时投票显示会放大从众效应，加速收敛但可能导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，具有进一步改进潜力，但需注意编排设置对集体决策动态的影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力显著，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击，攻击者通过精心设计的提示使模型偏离人类价值观。为了发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，需要开发更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 使用强化学习将初始越狱提示转化为形式化描述，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入来增强攻击效果。

Result: 在常见的开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了该攻击方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，通过形式化描述和GraphRAG系统增强越狱攻击的隐蔽性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐模型存在三个主要问题：对患者个性化信息关注不足、草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差、忽视中药'君臣佐使'配伍原则，影响疗效和安全性。

Method: 使用患者个性化提示序列预训练症状表示，应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；采用知识图谱引导的同构图扩散方法结合自注意力机制捕获症状-草药非线性关系；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验证明TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行综合评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更好地处理个性化信息、数据分布问题和中药配伍关系。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但通常存在噪声或不一致，这会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐效果。现有自动数据清洗方法缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 构建标准化评估协议，在多样化数据集、模型架构和优化算法上评估13种偏好数据清洗策略的对齐性能和泛化能力。

Result: 通过统一比较不同方法，揭示了数据清洗在LLM对齐任务中成功的关键决定因素。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐效果提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的重要作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中显示出巨大潜力，但如何在反应式闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍是一个重大挑战。简单的条件设置往往无法在复杂动态驾驶场景中提供足够指导。

Method: 提出了BridgeDrive，一种基于锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适当响应变化的交通状况。该方法与高效ODE求解器兼容。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有技术提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一种有效的锚点引导扩散方法，解决了现有方法在理论一致性和性能方面的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Motivation: 现有防护系统存在两个根本限制：对所有用户应用统一的防护策略，忽略了相同行为对不同用户的风险差异；仅检查孤立响应，无法追踪跨轮次的风险累积。

Method: 首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态来创建个性化防护栏；其次在整个智能体管道中实施持续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护栏、内存守护者等专用防护组件。

Result: 在医疗保健、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于现有防护系统如LlamaGuard3和AGrail。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM智能体提供了一条可执行且可审计的个性化安全路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具有推理能力而非仅会流畅模仿的小型模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data

base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自动化红队框架SafeSearch，用于评估搜索代理的安全性，发现LLM搜索代理在面对不可靠搜索结果时存在严重漏洞，最高攻击成功率可达90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索代理虽然能让LLM访问更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，这建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 开发了系统化、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建了包含300个测试用例的SafeSearch基准，涵盖五类风险（如错误信息和间接提示注入）。

Result: 评估了三种代表性搜索代理架构，覆盖7个专有和8个开源后端LLM。结果显示LLM搜索代理存在严重漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的最高攻击成功率达到了90.5%。

Conclusion: 常见防御实践（如提醒提示）效果有限，强调了该框架在促进更安全代理开发透明度方面的价值。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

### [916] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了评估稀疏自编码器特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的可靠激活程度

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征敏感性较差；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedLA框架，这是一个基于逻辑驱动的多智能体系统，用于解决复杂医疗问题。通过将推理过程组织成明确的逻辑树，并在多轮图引导讨论中迭代优化，实现了超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度的逻辑不一致问题。复杂医疗问题需要领域专业知识、患者特定信息以及结构化多视角推理。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提和结论）将推理过程组织成显式逻辑树，实现透明推理和前提级对齐。智能体通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代优化逻辑树，通过错误纠正和矛盾解决达成共识。

Result: 在MedDDx和标准医疗QA任务等挑战性基准测试中，MedLA持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线。该框架在开源和商业LLM骨干网络上都能有效扩展，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MedLA为可信赖的医疗推理提供了一个可泛化的范式，通过逻辑驱动的多智能体协作显著提升了复杂医疗问题解答的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EAPO框架，通过多轮外部专家交互增强RL训练中的探索，提高LLM推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果监督的RL方法存在探索效率低和奖励稀疏问题，需要改进

Method: EAPO框架让策略模型在训练时自适应决定何时及如何咨询专家，获得更丰富的奖励信号

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025和AIMO 2025数学推理基准上，EAPO平均比自探索模型提升5分

Conclusion: 外部专家协助能有效将专家知识内化到策略模型中，增强模型固有推理能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了平台编排的智能体系统的故障根因识别，构建了包含307个故障日志的数据集AgentFail，开发了故障根因分类法，并建立了基于LLM的根因识别基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低代码和模板化智能体开发平台的兴起，平台编排的智能体系统被广泛部署用于复杂推理和问题解决任务，但这些系统很脆弱，缺乏系统化的故障根因识别方法。

Method: 构建AgentFail数据集（包含307个故障日志），利用反事实推理修复策略确保标注可靠性，开发故障根因分类法，并建立基于LLM的根因识别基准测试。

Result: 分类法能显著提高LLM的根因识别性能，但最高准确率仅为33.6%，表明该任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该研究为平台编排的智能体系统提供了可靠的故障根因数据集、分类法和基准测试，为开发更可靠的智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd是一个过程奖励模型，通过提供密集的逐步反馈来解决GUI任务中的稀疏奖励和信用分配问题，在在线和离线设置中都能显著提升GUI智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列GUI任务中的自主智能体面临稀疏奖励和难以处理的信用分配问题，这阻碍了它们的训练效果。

Method: 提出了GUI-Shepherd过程奖励模型，基于包含52k交互的大规模数据集训练，数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的原理说明。该模型既可作为RL训练中的奖励提供者，也可作为推理验证器。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，通过多轮在线PPO将成功率提升了7.7个百分点；作为推理验证器带来5.1个百分点的提升。在离线AndroidControl基准测试中，作为奖励提供者提升2.2个百分点，作为验证器提升4.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 高质量的过程监督对于构建更强大的GUI智能体至关重要，GUI-Shepherd提供了一个通用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Result: 在两个诊断性多对象数据集上，OCEAN与最先进的黑盒模型性能相当，用户研究显示其解释更直观可信。

Conclusion: OCEAN提供了一个既具有竞争力性能又保持忠实推理过程的可解释AI框架。

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型方法很少解释推荐反应条件的原理，限制了其在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性，需要开发能够提供可解释推理的AI系统。

Method: 提出ChemMAS多智能体系统，将任务分解为机制基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和合理化聚合四个步骤，每个决策都基于化学知识和检索到的先例提供可解释的合理化建议。

Result: 实验显示ChemMAS在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提高20-35%，比通用大语言模型提高10-15%，同时提供可证伪、人类可信的合理化解释。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过基于证据的推理方法显著提升了反应条件推荐的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: FalconEye可作为MLLMs的实用安全审计工具，填补了多模态内容安全评估的研究空白。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 该框架能够提供连续、定量的运行时保证，通过动态概率保证范式有效应对自主AI系统的不可预测性。

Conclusion: AgentGuard通过动态概率保证和实时验证，为自主AI系统的安全运行提供了有效的运行时验证解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

Method: 1) 理论分析基于结果奖励对中间步骤的影响；2) 识别智能体强化学习中的梯度耦合问题；3) 提出训练行动者分类好坏动作的方法，通过分离好坏动作的嵌入表示来减轻梯度干扰。

Result: 理论分析表明基于结果的奖励实际上能确保有缺陷的中间步骤获得负优势值，这些动作在训练中应该受到惩罚。实验证明提出的分类方法能有效缓解梯度耦合问题。

Conclusion: 基于结果的奖励本身不会强化有缺陷的中间步骤，真正的问题在于智能体强化学习中的梯度耦合效应。通过训练行动者分类好坏动作可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: CANON是一种新的优势估计方法，通过无方向性地放大目标指标的影响来改进LLM的强化学习，在数学推理和逻辑任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在LLM推理任务中依赖手工设计的奖励或优势塑造，这些方向性先验可能过于偏颇且需要仔细的超参数调优，容易导致失败。

Method: 提出CANON方法：基于目标指标值将采样响应分为高低两组，通过组间比较衡量哪种指标趋势带来更好性能，并在同组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于现有方法；应用于响应长度时进一步提高了token效率，在性能-成本权衡中获得更优的Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: CANON通过无方向性地放大目标指标影响，有效改进了LLM的强化学习，在推理能力和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Motivation: 系统文献综述中的文献搜索、筛选和分析任务耗时，需要自动化方法来减少识别相关文献的工作量。

Method: 使用语法引导的遗传编程构建基于规则的可解释分类器，能够结合文本信息和文献计量数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成准确的分类器，同时保持可解释性，并支持现有方法不支持的配置信息源。

Conclusion: \ourmodel方法能够有效自动化论文选择过程，在不损害可解释性的前提下提高准确性，并支持更广泛的信息源。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Motivation: 科学发现常因手动开发计算工具而变慢，LLM在综合文献、推理数据和生成代码方面表现出色，但现有系统未能有效整合特定科学领域的非结构化知识。

Method: TusoAI将领域知识整合到知识树表示中，执行迭代的领域特定优化和模型诊断，通过候选解决方案池改进性能。

Conclusion: TusoAI展示了加速计算方法开发的潜力，能够自主开发优化工具并发现新的科学见解。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 尽管LLM/智能体在数据分析中取得显著进展，但仍面临挑战，论文提出了推进该领域发展的若干见解和实践方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，建议使用至少2次重复运行来减少排名反转，并报告不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不明确。

Method: 在AI4Math基准上重新评估八个最先进模型，每个设置进行三次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估。

Result: 单次运行排行榜脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转；平均运行仅带来约5%的标准误差缩减。

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这些实践能提高鲁棒性且对小团队可行。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解决复杂问题时经常出现最终答案与自身推理过程相矛盾的现象，作者假设这是由于思维链推理和记忆检索两种竞争机制同时存在导致的。

Method: 通过控制实验向模型提供误导性推理线索和/或损坏的检索答案，验证两种机制的同时存在。然后提出FARL框架，结合记忆遗忘和强化学习来抑制检索捷径。

Result: 实验证实思维链推理和记忆检索确实同时存在，其相对主导地位受问题领域、模型规模和微调方法等因素影响。FARL框架能有效促进推理主导行为并增强泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: 当前推理微调范式存在关键局限性，模型可能利用检索机制作为捷径来"破解"奖励信号。FARL框架通过抑制检索捷径，能够促进真正的推理能力发展。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO是一种鲁棒偏好优化框架，通过EM算法推断标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，将现有对齐算法转化为鲁棒版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF）基于两个错误假设：人类偏好是同质的且数据无噪声。实际上人类偏好是多元的且标注者会犯错，这导致记录数据与真实偏好之间存在差异，误导模型并降低性能。

Method: 使用期望最大化（EM）算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失中的每个数据点以缓解噪声。建立了任意偏好损失与其对应概率模型之间的理论联系，将现有对齐算法系统转化为鲁棒对应版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架，持续提升了四种最先进对齐算法（DPO、IPO、SimPO和CPO）的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了高达7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO通过处理人类偏好数据中的噪声和异质性问题，有效提升了语言模型对齐的性能，理论上证明在完美校准模型条件下能收敛到数据集的真实噪声水平。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

Motivation: 理解为什么在线对齐方法比离线对齐方法表现更好，从人类感知的角度提供理论解释，并探索如何在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更快速、廉价和灵活的后训练。

Method: 基于前景理论，提出在线策略采样能更好地近似人类感知分布，PPO/GRPO的裁剪操作反映了人类对概率的感知偏差。开发了humanline变体方法，将概率的感知失真显式地纳入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中。

Result: Humanline变体方法即使在离线非策略数据上训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上达到与在线对应方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身对于最大化人类效用是偶然的，通过模拟人类感知的方式有选择地训练任何数据，可以实现相同的效果，从而实现更快速、廉价和灵活的后训练而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

*Shaobin Ling,Yun Wang,Chenyou Fan,Tin Lun Lam,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个新型多机器人协作规划框架，通过引入动作链作为基本规划单元，在动态环境中平衡适应性和效率，相比现有方法仅需24%的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在多机器人协作中存在基本权衡：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且随团队规模和任务复杂度扩展性差。

Method: 提出ELHPlan框架，使用动作链（绑定子目标意图的动作序列）作为基本规划原语，采用循环过程：构建意图绑定动作序列、主动验证冲突和可行性、针对性机制修复问题、执行验证动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan实现了可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token。

Conclusion: 本研究为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的自适应推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例级别的推理深度调节，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一的推理深度，浪费简单查询的计算资源，而对复杂问题可能思考不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度自适应分配计算的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，决定停止推理或应用微小的ponder步骤。通过添加预计算的引导向量到冻结表示中，提取与深度推理输出相关的潜在引导向量，并通过可调缩放因子重新应用。采用GRPO作为奖励信号来平衡性能和计算成本。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs实现更好的匹配精度，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder通过潜在引导实现了有效的自适应推理计算分配，在不修改主干权重的情况下优化了计算效率，且学习到的计算分配与问题难度具有可解释的相关性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 该论文发现了语言模型融合的紧凑幂律：模型大小相关的性能下限随模型容量降低，而融合专家数量的收益呈现明显的递减规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏能够预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时收益的定量规则。

Method: 通过经验性研究语言模型融合的缩放规律，测量交叉熵，分析不同架构和方法（Average、TA、TIES、DARE）下的性能曲线。

Result: 发现了紧凑的幂律关系，该规律在领域内和跨领域都成立，能够紧密拟合测量曲线，并解释了两个稳健规律：大部分收益在早期获得，随着专家数量增加变异性减小。

Conclusion: 该缩放定律使融合从启发式实践转变为可计算效率高、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可预测的缩放原则，通过组合专家实现可预测的收益。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

TL;DR: SpecExit是一个新颖的框架，通过轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销，显著减少生成长度66%并实现2.5倍端到端延迟加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要的长输出和高的端到端延迟，限制了实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入了检测开销，限制了延迟收益并影响跨问题泛化性。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态使用的启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。利用隐藏状态的固有信号提供有效的提前退出信号。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟实现2.5倍加速，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了利用隐藏状态进行高效推理的广泛适用性，为大型推理模型的实时部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要关注非协作物理任务，而协作任务需要系统推断用户对队友意图的假设，这是一个模糊且动态的过程，需要可解释和可修正的表示方法。

Method: 将协作任务学习框架化为程序合成问题，用可编辑程序表示行为，使用配对的物理动作和自然语言（语音演示）作为统一的教学、检查和修正方式。

Result: 在20名用户参与的多人足球战术教学研究中，70%的用户成功修正学习到的程序以匹配其意图，90%的用户认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中启用用户教学的独特挑战，并讨论了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出现有图推理方法存在方向性问题，提出将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，并构建了更难的GraphAlgorithm基准，提出了Simple-RTC方法取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM图推理方法性能不佳，主要问题在于推理方向错误——让LLM复制图算法而非设计算法，导致基础模型能力被低估。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法：先引导LLM设计图算法，然后编写代码解决图推理任务。构建了包含239个不同图问题、3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到接近完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 重新定向推理重点可以大幅提升LLM图推理能力，Simple-RTC为未来LLM图推理研究提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架RS-GRPO，通过风险寻求目标在均值与最大奖励间插值，解决RLVR方法在LLM推理任务中的探索困境，提升多解性能(pass@k)同时保持单解准确率(pass@1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLM的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法，导致解决方案多样性不足，多解性能(pass@k)被抑制，只能蒸馏现有能力而非发现新推理策略。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习框架，使用风险寻求目标在均值与最大奖励间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动深度探索。

Result: 在6个数学推理基准和5个不同LLM上，RS-GRPO持续提升pass@k性能，同时保持或增强pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO是简单易实现的解决方案，仅需少量代码修改，能有效解决RLVR的探索困境，促进LLM在复杂推理任务中的能力发现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒和可靠的推理模型确立了新方向

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一的图-语言模型集成框架，有效解决了现有GraphRAG方法的局限性，在知识密集型推理任务中表现出色，具有良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: 现有MLLM在医学诊断中存在关键失败模式：早期证据解释的不稳定性导致幻觉，产生分支推理轨迹并级联成全局不一致的结论，需要开发能够约束随机性和幻觉的可审计临床推理系统。

Method: MedMMV通过多样化短路径推演稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医学基准上，MedMMV准确率提升达12.7%，盲法医师评估证实其显著提高推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在临床决策支持等高风险领域部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Fin-Solution 2.O解决方案，包含Fin-Vault多轮金融对话数据集和Fin-Ally统一模型，通过整合常识推理、礼貌性和人性化对话动态，为金融科技领域提供更专业的AI咨询服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融科技行业的快速发展需要专业的咨询服务，但现有LLMs在金融领域微调时可能产生不专业或轻率的回复，缺乏领域特定数据集导致研究局限于孤立组件。

Method: 1) 构建Fin-Vault多轮金融对话数据集(1,417个标注对话)；2) 开发Fin-Ally统一模型，集成COMET-BART常识上下文，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)机制生成人性化对齐的回复。

Result: 整合常识上下文使语言模型能够生成更精细、文本精确且专业基础更强的金融指导，支持个性化预算、实时费用跟踪和自动化财务规划。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融科技领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，通过常识推理和人性化对话动态的结合，显著提升了金融咨询服务的专业性和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: 提出了自适应蒙特卡洛搜索（AMCS）框架，用于高效生成过程监督数据来训练过程奖励模型（PRM），显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且不够灵活

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计和路径扩展层面实现自适应动态搜索：1）自适应细化估计，为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本；2）通过具有时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法增强路径扩展，从广泛探索逐渐转向利用最有希望的方向

Result: 构建了包含约20万过程监督示例的大规模数据集MathSearch-200K。在四个数学推理基准测试中，Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下超越了72B模型

Conclusion: AMCS方法在分布外问题上保持了一致优势，展示了强大的泛化能力，为过程奖励模型训练提供了高效的数据生成框架

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM框架将数学推理分为策略规划和目标执行两个阶段，通过轻量级策略适配器预测四种推理策略的置信度分布，并采用自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法，在多个数学推理基准测试中优于单一策略和集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，但单一策略无法适应问题特定需求，且在效果和效率之间存在权衡问题。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，首先构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，然后训练策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布，在推理时根据置信度动态选择单策略执行、双策略验证或多策略探索。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM相比单一策略和集成基线有0.9%到7.6%的提升，自适应路由方法在不同模型架构上都表现出强优势。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过解耦策略规划和目标执行，实现了自适应推理策略选择，在数学推理任务中取得了显著效果提升。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 本文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程中的安全触发步骤来提升大型推理模型的安全推理能力，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，但推理过程本身的不安全仍会造成潜在风险。现有方法忽视了安全推理的重要性，需要专门对推理过程进行安全对齐。

Method: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法：1）识别推理中的安全触发关键步骤；2）将合规性线索替换为安全触发机制；3）构建强信号偏好学习对，通过干预将不安全推理轨迹转向安全路径。

Result: 在越狱和对抗性安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升了推理和响应的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线方法，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务中保持了优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径，证明IPO方法能有效提升模型的安全推理能力。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域的泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流，围绕思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，开发了新的数据标注和训练框架。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的九个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）中通过加权多数投票实现了6.5%的平均准确率提升，显著优于其他数学导向的PRM模型。

Conclusion: 通过关注逻辑流而非领域知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，证明了该方法在提升模型跨领域泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Motivation: 解决约束编程中手动建模的瓶颈问题，传统被动约束获取方法容易在有限数据上过拟合，而纯主动方法查询成本高。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，基于概率置信度的交互式精炼阶段识别过拟合约束，专用子集探索机制从被拒候选约束中恢复有效子结构，最后进行主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解实现了最低的相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推进了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域，能够有效避免局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

*Nikolaos Kondylidis,Andrea Rafanelli,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette ten Teije,Frank van Harmelen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种直观的人机教学架构，让人类通过提供示例来教代理执行主观任务，如食材替换。通过领域知识扩展代理的任务理解，使用高效学习方法从少量示例中学习，并优化人类选择最具代表性示例的方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从少量示例中快速学习新概念，但在主观任务（如食材替换）中数据稀缺，需要让AI系统复制这种能力。目标是创建直观的人机交互，使代理能够从单个示例中增量学习。

Method: 提出人机教学架构：1）利用领域知识扩展代理的任务理解；2）使用高效学习方法从有限示例中学习；3）优化人类选择最具代表性和最少冗余示例的方式。应用于食材替换任务，使用Recipe1MSubs数据集模拟人类输入。

Result: 代理仅需100个示例就能达到完整训练集（50k示例）一半的任务性能。通过策略性排序示例和利用外部符号知识的学习方法，代理能够更有效地泛化。

Conclusion: 通过结合领域知识、高效学习方法和优化示例选择，可以创建能够从少量示例中学习主观任务的AI代理，实现更直观的人机教学交互。

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使通信能实现协调，也不一定意味着真正的理解。在信号游戏中，代理可能发展出"成功的误解"——使用不同解释但能协调行动。这种误解难以发现和修复，且会阻碍与新伙伴的协调。至少三个代理相互交互是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设：协调是否意味着理解。探索在缺乏共同观察（如人类与AI代理混合群体）的环境中，通信如何自然产生。

Method: 使用信号游戏模型，代理在仅能观察通信信号和互动结果（奖励）的情况下发展新词汇。代理独立发展信号、使用信号并精炼解释，而不观察其他代理如何使用信号。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时会形成"成功的误解"——代理使用不同的信号解释但能成功协调。这种误解难以发现，且会阻碍与新伙伴的协调。至少三个代理相互交互能确保共享解释的出现。

Conclusion: 协调成功不一定意味着真正的理解。"成功的误解"是可能的且难以检测。群体规模（至少三个代理）和完全连接性是确保共享解释自然出现的关键条件。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但面对难题时会产生无效推理。研究发现模型具有能力边界自感知能力，并提出基于推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控的优化策略，显著提升可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前回答范式忽视了问题与模型能力边界的关系，导致模型在面对难题时进行无效推理，浪费计算资源并产生错误答案。

Method: 研究发现：黑盒模型中，推理表达能揭示边界信号；白盒模型中，最后一个输入token的隐藏状态编码边界信息。基于此提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略使模型避免无效推理而不牺牲准确性，显著提升可靠性和效率，token使用量减少62.7-93.6%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型具有能力边界自感知能力，通过监控推理表达和隐藏状态可以有效识别并避免无效推理，提升模型效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG信号高维、噪声大、非欧几里得特性带来的视觉神经表征解码挑战

Method: 使用EEG图变换器（EGT）同时编码空间脑连接和时间神经动态，结合图原型对比学习（GAC）减少被试内变异性

Result: 在Things-EEG数据集上显著优于现有EEG解码方法，在受试者依赖和独立评估中均表现优异

Conclusion: 图学习与对比目标的结合为EEG脑解码提供了变革性潜力，可实现更通用和鲁棒的神经表征

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LogicAgent框架，结合符号学方阵指导，通过一阶逻辑多视角推理和存在性导入检查来解决逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的交互问题，并在新基准RepublicQA上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场等人类推理核心挑战的场景。

Method: LogicAgent框架：1）基于符号学方阵指导多视角一阶逻辑推理；2）通过存在性导入检查避免空泛推理；3）采用三值决策方案（真、假、不确定）处理边界情况。

Result: 在RepublicQA基准上平均提升6.25%，在主流逻辑推理基准（ProntoQA、ProofWriter等）上平均提升7.05%，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于符号学的多视角推理能显著提升大语言模型的逻辑推理性能，特别是在处理复杂语义和逻辑交互的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了TSR-Suite时间序列推理套件，包含四个原子任务和三种基础推理能力，并基于此开发了首个统一推理模型TimeOmni-1，在因果关系发现和事件感知预测等任务上显著优于GPT-4.1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态时间序列数据集停留在表面对齐和问答层面，缺乏真正需要推理的任务定义和高质量数据，限制了时间序列推理模型的发展。

Method: 引入TSR-Suite套件，定义了感知、外推和决策三种基础推理能力对应的四个原子任务；开发了TimeOmni-1统一推理模型，采用多阶段训练，整合任务场景、奖励函数和优化策略。

Result: TimeOmni-1在所有任务上表现出强大的分布外泛化能力，因果关系发现准确率从35.9%提升到64.0%，事件感知预测任务的有效响应率比GPT-4.1提高超过6%。

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了全面的评估框架和数据管道，TimeOmni-1证明了统一推理模型在解决多样化现实世界问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了查询电路方法，直接在模型内部追踪特定输入到输出的信息流，提供更忠实和计算可访问的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能揭示全局能力电路，无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要局部、输入级的解释方法。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发标准化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，使用基于采样的方法高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试(IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC)中发现模型内存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%模型连接即可恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为忠实、可扩展地解释语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换，忽视了训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标分解和聚合样本的逻辑结构，并提出重新认知优化策略系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了性能和泛化能力，优于以数据为中心的策略，并在强化学习框架下得到验证。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据推理复杂度而非数据规模或表面形式对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解，但在AI研究中尚未充分探索。现有方法主要是单一模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 系统包含三个协同工作室：视觉工作室解释图表，逻辑工作室制定解决方案，评审工作室进行双阶段验证。通过迭代优化循环实现协同进化，评审工作室的反馈持续指导逻辑工作室进行自我修正。

Result: 在HiPhO基准测试中实现了三大突破：强泛化能力提升各种模型性能；历史性突破使开源模型从1-2枚金牌增加到6枚；在最新IPhO中开源模型首次获得金牌，得分26.8/30，排名第4位。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级问题解决提供了可泛化的框架，有潜力扩展到其他学科领域。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索使用语义嵌入复制心理测量结构的可能性。

Method: 使用SQuID处理大语言模型嵌入，在修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)上验证，比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标。

Result: 嵌入方法能解释人类数据中55%的维度相似性方差，多维缩放配置显示良好的因子一致性，遵循基础理论。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统人类调查建立的心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的法律基准没有考虑多智能体系统的独特优势，如任务分解、智能体专业化和灵活训练，这限制了MAS在法律领域的潜力。

Method: 使用GDPR作为应用场景，手动设计各种基于角色的多智能体系统，并使用最先进的LLM进行广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了现有模型和多智能体系统架构的优势、局限性和改进方向。

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估方法的空白，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

TL;DR: 对V2X协同感知系统进行实证研究，识别了6种常见错误模式，评估了关键组件的影响，发现LiDAR协同性能最佳、V2I和V2V在不同融合方案下表现不同、协同感知错误可能导致更多驾驶违规、系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知的局限，但由于其复杂的组成（多样传感器、协作智能体、不同融合方案、不同通信条件），带来了许多操作挑战，且错误类型和原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模系统性评估，识别和分析协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，评估关键组件对感知性能的影响。

Result: 发现：(1) LiDAR协同配置感知性能最高；(2) V2I和V2V在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3) 协同感知错误增加可能导致更多驾驶违规；(4) 在线运行时系统对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件的潜在风险和脆弱性，希望促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现过程需要观察、分析和假设生成的循环，目前机器学习主要处理单个环节，但完全自动化这一开放式、启发式的探索循环仍具挑战。

Method: 利用大语言模型的工具使用能力，通过代码执行等基础工具，让智能体自由探索未知物理系统，包括机械动力学系统、波演化、量子多体物理等。

Conclusion: 这种设置的有效性为在其他领域进行类似科学探索打开了大门，无需微调或任务特定指令。

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型当前能力的差异，导致训练效率低下和性能上限受限。

Method: 利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型充当自己的老师，多样化中等难度问题并简化挑战性问题。

Result: 在8个数学和通用推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均pass@1提升6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力协同演化的动态过程，为更高效训练更强推理模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示，成本高且覆盖范围有限，需要一种可扩展的方法来生成高质量的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：探索阶段让MLLM代理系统性地发现环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指南提示来合成任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用上生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用上生成10k任务，训练出的UI代理在移动使用场景中成功率提升20.0%，在计算机使用场景中提升10.9%。结合强化学习可额外获得5.7%的增益。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为训练能力强的MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的后训练方法，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过显式推理构建透明且不断改进的世界模型，实现更通用和可解释智能体的路径。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and

successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，通过组合现有技能来获得组合能力，这种能力可以泛化到更复杂的问题并迁移到不同任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于RL在LLM后训练中作用的争议：RL是教授真正新技能还是仅仅激活现有能力。通过实验验证LLMs是否能在RL过程中获得组合现有技能的新能力。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数f(x)输出的能力。在LLM已学习f和g的基础上，通过RL训练学习未见过的组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLMs能够学习未见过的函数组合，这种组合能力可泛化到>2个函数的更复杂组合，并能迁移到不同任务。RL从根本上改变了模型的推理行为。

Conclusion: RL能够使LLMs获得真正的新组合技能，建议先构建具有基础技能的基座模型，然后使用RL激励复杂问题的先进、可泛化技能。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成人类反馈进行对齐，但为了实现持续模型改进和多维度对齐，未来模型需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发了两种互补方法：1）用户引导重写：根据用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意的模型输出；2）基于用户奖励：通过基于用户长期交互历史（称为persona）的奖励模型进行学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 有机人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕获高级推理所需的抽象语义）。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述来促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理增强全局场景理解和空间推理能力。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验证明了导航性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理可以有效地增强导航代理的上下文理解能力，提高导航准确性。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体的自我评判成功和失败经验中提取推理策略，在测试时检索相关记忆指导交互；MaTTS通过扩展智能体的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Conclusion: 内存驱动的经验扩展成为一个新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务中却不如人类，假设是缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力

Method: 在几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转三个领域设计任务，通过操纵几何概念复杂度、感知个体化负荷和变换难度来改变串行处理需求，比较人类和VLM表现

Result: 所有领域都显示出一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加（作为串行处理负荷的代理）强相关，任务需要更多串行处理时，VLM与人类表现差距扩大

Conclusion: 串行视觉基础推理的局限性是区分当前VLM与人类的基本瓶颈

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

Method: 提出统一对抗偏好学习(UniAPL)框架，将对齐问题重构为约束优化问题，实现单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习，让密集的专家演示直接规范和基础化在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上评估UniAPL，使用Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507作为教师模型。UniAPL模型匹配或超越强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（匹配32B模型），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超越教师模型。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，输出与专家演示高度相似。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法捕捉判断分数与候选内容之间的交互关系。

Method: 提出了J-Detector，一个轻量级透明的神经检测器，通过显式提取语言特征和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行准确检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，并验证了判断检测在现实场景中的实际效用。

Conclusion: LLM生成的判断是可检测的，J-Detector能够有效识别这些判断并量化其中的偏见，为敏感场景中的判断验证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.
