### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义错位和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含两个锚定路径：时间域的MoCLIP对比学习提供语义监督，频率域的低频DCT分量提供补充对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效且可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2,720个问题-答案对，专注于测试模型在密集场景中的基础视觉理解能力。测试显示当前最好的模型仅达到19.6%的准确率，暴露了现有视觉语言模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA基准测试可能高估了视觉语言模型的性能，特别是在处理密集场景细节时。作者认为编码和推理细节对现有模型仍是挑战。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景。手动标注了六类任务的问题来全面测试场景理解能力。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最好的模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析显示模型存在计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致等问题。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号（心率）同时保持视觉保真度，通过3D VAE和文本编码器融合实现可控心率编辑，解决基于摄像头的生理信号监测带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然提供了非接触式监测心率的便利方式，但面部视频中的生命信号会引发严重的隐私问题，可能泄露与个人健康和情绪状态相关的敏感信息。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器（3D VAE）将输入视频编码到潜在空间，同时通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示。使用具有自适应层归一化（AdaLN）的可训练时空层进行融合，以捕捉远程光电容积描记（rPPG）信号的强时间相干性。在解码器中应用特征级线性调制（FiLM）和微调输出层，避免生理信号在重建过程中退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现平均心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持视觉质量的同时实现了可控的心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，专注于视角转换的核心挑战，包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于空间推理需要多种认知能力，如跨视图识别物体、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要开发一个能够系统评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准。

Method: 设计包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别的基准测试，从单物体简单任务逐步过渡到多物体视角转换的最具挑战性设置，评估37个最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估结果显示系统性的弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致。缩放分析显示平滑改进和新兴能力。人类准确率高达91.2%，人类反应时间与VLM准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为视觉语言模型的空间推理提供了关键见解，突出了它们在物理空间推理能力方面的关键差距，能够捕捉人类和VLMs共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空变换器(MM-STT)，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测的准确性，相比现有方法将长期预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行准确预测。

Method: 设计多模态时空变换器框架，核心创新是联合时空注意力机制，以统一方式处理所有多模态特征，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，长期预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构内在的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthLM通过在VLM上进行基于文本的稀疏标签监督微调，无需密集预测头或复杂损失函数，就能实现专家级别的3D理解能力，在深度估计任务上超越了现有VLM 2倍以上，首次使VLM可与纯视觉模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在3D理解方面表现不佳，而专业视觉模型虽然能实现超人类精度的深度估计，但需要特定架构和损失函数。研究探索VLM是否能在不改变架构或损失的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的稀疏标签监督微调，通过视觉提示和内在条件增强解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题，无需密集预测头或复杂回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM使用更小的模型，在深度估计任务上超越了最先进VLM 2倍以上的精度，首次使VLM与纯视觉模型相媲美，且自然地避免了过度平滑问题。

Conclusion: VLM通过简单的方法即可解锁强大的3D理解能力，单个VLM可以覆盖超越度量深度的各种3D任务，证明了VLM在3D理解方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，结合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，通过全局-局部模块设计、贝叶斯扩展和决策级数据融合来解决海冰特征识别、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性量化对于业务化海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等关键挑战而难以实现。

Method: 1. 设计具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改进特征提取；2. 将Transformer模型扩展为贝叶斯版本，将参数视为随机变量以更好地捕获不确定性；3. 在决策级融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2）以解决数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试表明，相比其他不确定性量化方法，所提模型能够同时获得高分辨率海冰浓度图和稳健的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的Transformer架构设计、贝叶斯扩展和多源数据融合，有效解决了泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，实现了高精度海冰浓度制图和可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于路边摄像头和LiDAR的车辆检测定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波融合策略，在复杂交通环境中实现精确可靠的车辆跟踪


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工作区等高风险路段中基础设施感知系统面临的实际部署障碍，包括透视失真、复杂几何、遮挡和成本问题

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波后期融合策略提升轨迹一致性

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低70%，横向精度保持在1-3米；现场验证显示融合轨迹与真实车辆路径高度匹配，即使单传感器数据不连续

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器局限性，为复杂交通环境中的主动安全措施提供实用部署路径

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先看后推理"的新范式解决MLLM在AI生成图像检测中的性能不佳问题，强调先增强对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力，再进行推理判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根本原因在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据格式与预训练分布差异大，导致模型依赖语言捷径而非真实视觉证据。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先看后推理"范式：首先训练MLLM增强对伪造痕迹的视觉感知能力，然后基于实际观察进行推理。同时提出ExplainFake-Bench基准从五个关键方面评估MLLM在图像取证中的可解释性。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和真正可靠的可解释性方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过强化MLLM的伪造感知视觉能力，使其推理基于实际观察，能够显著提升AI生成图像检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来区分真实人类和深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。视频通话提供了观察深度伪造"视线"的机会，而真实的视线模式在对话中具有特定的非语言交流特征，深度伪造无法模仿这种细微特征。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的仔细审查，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用恶意行为者视频流中估计的视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建的新数据集上测试，模型达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时深度伪造检测提供了新的生物特征信息途径。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门用于火星样本返回任务中的机械臂物体定位，在硬件受限条件下实现高效可靠的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在硬件严重受限条件下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的精确定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器结合新的模板匹配度量方法，专门针对边缘域进行优化，仅需低精度、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和精度方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性，特别适用于资源受限的太空任务环境。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地面临挑战，包括场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道，结合现成的视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大型语言模型进行符号推理。流程包括：LLM提取相关对象类型和属性、检测候选区域、VLM生成丰富视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步改善接地效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM具有互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称接地。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

TL;DR: VISOR++ 是一种通过优化视觉输入来实现视觉语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，仅通过插入特定图像即可引导模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发能在多个VLM间通用的转向方法。

Method: 通过优化视觉输入生成VISOR++图像，这些图像能诱导目标激活模式，从而控制模型行为。可以针对单个模型或模型集合生成通用转向图像。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能。对未见过的开源和闭源模型也能实现行为转向，同时在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现有效的模型行为转向，无需运行时模型访问，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 解决当前强化学习增强视觉语言模型推理能力时对人工标注数据的高度依赖问题，降低训练成本并促进实际部署。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中扮演多角色进行战略推理；从任意图像生成游戏；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法，交替使用自玩和带可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法，尽管使用无标签数据。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了视觉语言模型可以通过游戏化自玩实现有效的自我改进，无需人工标注，具有强大的泛化能力和持续性能提升潜力。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI诊断方法在眼底图像分割上面临挑战，特别是数据集分辨率低、标注不一致的问题，限制了分割模型的有效性。

Method: 提出新颖的混合方法，将数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的见解相结合，充分利用两种方法的优势，减少对大规模训练数据的依赖。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统奠定了基础，具有在自动病灶标注中应用的潜力，可提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在与先前视觉GNN架构相当的FLOPs下提供了有竞争力的准确率

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集用于医学影像的少样本学习研究，比较了迁移学习和ProtoNet方法在多标签分类任务中的表现，发现迁移学习方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要研究少样本学习方法。现有研究主要关注标准少样本学习，而医学应用通常需要同时学习新类别并利用已有知识，这更符合广义少样本分类场景。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸部X光片的大规模数据集MetaChest，设计了专门用于少样本分类的元集划分和多标签episode生成算法。评估了标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每个episode的类别数量和每个类别的训练样本数量能提升分类性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像能提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构能获得与大型模型相当的性能但资源需求显著降低。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学影像少样本多标签分类中表现优异，高效模型架构能在保持性能的同时大幅降低资源需求，为实际医学应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

TL;DR: K-Prism是一个统一的医学图像分割框架，通过整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，实现了灵活的分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型存在碎片化问题，通常针对单一任务、模态或器官进行训练，而临床实践中专家需要整合多种知识源。

Method: 采用双提示表示法：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由处理。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，为医学图像分割提供了一个统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高分辨率整体重建的高成本问题，同时满足了用户对局部精细细节的需求。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

TL;DR: 提出AFGeo方法，一种用于跨视角目标地理定位的无锚框方法，通过直接预测四个方向偏移量来定位目标，无需预定义锚框。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角目标地理定位方法大多基于锚框，这种方法受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实框的四个方向偏移量；使用高斯位置编码(GPE)建模查询图像中的点击点；引入跨视角目标关联模块(CVOAM)关联不同视角下的同一目标及其周围环境。

Result: AFGeo在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算效率高。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合GPE和CVOAM，以最小的参数开销实现了高性能的跨视角目标地理定位。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GCL提供了一种高效的多模态检索解决方案，无需繁琐的数据集构建过程，即可提升模型在复杂多模态检索任务中的表现

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型，结合ConSinGAN数据增强技术，用于金属板材表面和孔洞缺陷的自动检测。YOLOv9模型在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳，并已集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中耗时费力的缺陷检测任务，传统方法效率低下且人工成本高。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板材图像数据，结合四种YOLO模型版本（v3、v4、v7、v9）进行缺陷检测。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN表现最佳，准确率达到91.3%，检测时间为146毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法成功建立了实用的自动光学检测系统，并可轻松应用于工业制造中的其他组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OmniDFA框架，通过开放集、少样本源识别的新范式解决AI生成图像检测和源模型归属问题，并构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像检测和源模型归属面临生成模型结构多样性的挑战，现有检测方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，而源归属方法受限于缺乏大规模、分类良好的合成数据集。

Method: 提出开放集、少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架，不仅能评估图像真实性，还能以少样本方式确定合成来源，并构建了包含45个生成模型的117万张图像数据集OmniFake。

Result: 实验表明OmniDFA在开放集归属方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和源归属提供了有效的解决方案，其数据集和代码将公开可用。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过三个协同组件解决现有方法在视觉语言推理中的局限性：上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些方法不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制无法有效捕捉模型对信息的认知需求。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个组件：(1)上下文增强注意力图生成，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；(2)主动视觉探测，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；(3)动态注意力转移触发，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态结构化推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，这主要由早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估驱动，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面很成功，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。现有工作主要关注特征化、检测和缓解记忆现象，但记忆发生的根本原因仍未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究扩散模型记忆机制。具体包括分析训练损失、记忆提示的影响以及中间潜在变量的分解。

Result: 发现：(i)记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，训练损失在记忆时反而更大；(ii)记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛；(iii)中间潜在变量分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容取代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，这为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医疗视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，解决了医疗多模态数据多对多映射的问题，在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗决策需要整合多种医疗信息，但现有医疗视觉语言预训练模型未能直接考虑多对多映射关系，无法有效处理不同模态间的复杂关联。

Method: 使用概率对比学习建模嵌入分布，采用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失来改善模态内绑定，将四种医疗模态对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间。

Result: 在13个医疗数据集上的实验表明，模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，实现了更好的模态内和模态间绑定。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效解决了医疗多模态数据的多对多映射问题，为医疗决策提供了更强大的多模态整合能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本和Plackett-Luce模型来解决现有方法依赖简化成对比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性的检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子。基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本。采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略处理多负样本比较。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO持续改进多模态对齐，优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互。

Method: 提出轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和视觉相似性，使用贪婪加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到最先进水平，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互建模显著提升了视觉地点识别性能，仅使用4096维全局描述符在SPED上达到100%的Recall@10。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑。通过将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记，结合位置映射位置编码和基于视觉语言模型的地标预测器，实现了精确的属性控制和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难。传统方法将结构面部表示（如地标）视为刚性几何约束，当地标与源图像显著偏离时会导致身份退化。

Method: 1) 地标标记器：将原始地标坐标直接量化为离散面部标记；2) 位置映射位置编码：整合面部和图像标记进行统一处理；3) 地标预测器：利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标；4) 构建HFL-150K数据集解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在身份保持方面比最先进方法提高7.8%，在语义一致性方面提高4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和位置编码方法，实现了更好的细粒度人脸编辑效果，在身份保持和语义一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下有效解决了视频对象分割的挑战

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

Motivation: 解决现有方法在单张图像3D人体姿态恢复中的模糊性问题，传统确定性方法只能输出单一结果，而概率方法在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成以3D旋转表示的姿态参数分布，通过条件丢弃实现无条件和图像条件生成，利用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每个关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，解决了准确性与多样性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模与2D观测对齐的3D人体姿态分布，在保持准确性的同时提供多样化的合理输出。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 构建统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性；在单次前向传播中实现连贯编辑。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过引入几何引导，显著提升了基于拖拽的图像编辑在几何密集型场景中的精确性和一致性，为交互式图像编辑提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一种基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建方法，通过减少对多视角几何约束的依赖，利用单视图内的丰富空间信息，显著提升了重建质量和视图不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视角像素反投影射线交集的弱几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域性能较差。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中的视图受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了重建稳定性和视图不变性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了在此领域基础复杂视觉线索的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个用于虚拟试穿的测量引导扩散框架，通过解决线性逆问题来渐进式保持非试穿区域的一致性，消除边界伪影，同时保持身份和背景信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保持非试穿区域（如身份和背景）方面存在挑战，直接替换策略会导致边界伪影和语义漂移问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器，结合残差先验初始化和无伪影测量引导采样，包括数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影和语义漂移问题，实现了更好的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本偏好优化（TPO）框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配的提示词而非不匹配的提示词，实现无需配对图像偏好数据的文本到图像模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习的奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示词，训练模型偏好匹配提示词。扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在人类偏好得分和文本-图像对齐方面始终优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了"免费午餐"对齐，无需配对图像偏好数据，具有更好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

TL;DR: v-HUB是一个新的视觉中心视频幽默理解基准，包含来自无声电影和在线资源的短视频，用于评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在仅通过视觉线索的情况下，这对于提升人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含精选的无声短视频，配有字幕、描述和解释等丰富标注，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并创建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视频（无音频）评估时，字幕匹配性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解，表明声音信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默存在困难，整合更丰富的模态（如音频）对于复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PCPO框架解决文本到图像模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过比例信用分配机制显著提升收敛速度和图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定目标重构和时间步重新加权来强制实施比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速收敛并提升图像质量，在所有方面大幅优于现有策略梯度基线方法

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决生成采样器中不成比例的信用分配问题，有效缓解模型崩溃，为文本到图像模型的强化学习对齐提供了更稳定的训练框架

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

### [44] [Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)
*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保留和可编辑性，解决了现有方法在遵循目标文本提示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中面临挑战：反演的噪声图虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了进行所需编辑的灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明ENM Inversion在广泛图像编辑任务中，在内容保留和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion通过优化噪声图搜索，有效平衡了内容保留和编辑灵活性，为文本引导的图像和视频编辑提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自一致性原则和组相对策略优化，让视觉语言模型自主提升图像质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用自一致性原则生成伪标签，通过成对多数投票建立相对质量共识，然后使用组相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在多样化的IQA基准测试中，EvoQuality将基础VLM的零样本性能提升了31.8%，在7个基准中的5个上超越了最先进的监督VLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明完全自监督的方法可以在图像质量评估任务中达到甚至超越监督方法的性能，为VLM在感知领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一种概率学生-教师模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易获取，但传统上需要更复杂的超声心动图(ECHO)来评估心脏功能。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要ECHO才能获得的关键结果，使ECG成为更易获取的心脏功能预测方法。

Method: 提出EchoingECG概率学生-教师模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP(在ECHO-文本对上预训练的视觉语言模型)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证表明，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计帮助识别ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: EchoingECG成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了基于ECG的心脏功能预测性能，并通过不确定性估计增强了模型性能的理解。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了Point-It-Out (PIO)基准测试，通过精确的视觉定位来系统评估视觉语言模型在具身推理任务中的能力，包含三个层次评估阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计了包含三个阶段的层次化评估协议：S1-指称对象定位、S2-任务驱动指向、S3-视觉轨迹预测，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等具身智能关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现，GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了不同VLM在具身推理能力上的显著差异，强调了精确视觉定位能力评估的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业场景中小密集物体的精确分割，参数量仅为原SAM的4.26%，在多个指标上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战，需要开发在极端数据约束下仍能实现精确分割的方法。

Method: 引入动态相似性图适应(DSGA)模块，通过可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制构建动态相似性图，结合自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA集成形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，豆荚计数R平方达0.8987。

Conclusion: 该框架在极少量训练数据下实现了精确的农业物体分割，为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案，验证了图基特征适应与LoRA结合的有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在领域特定场景（如产品审核）中的应用研究不足，传统logo识别方法依赖记忆大量品牌表示，在实际场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo；引入领域特定的多模态推理：Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过新的领域特定多模态推理范式，能够在小规模品牌监督下实现大规模品牌识别，解决了传统方法的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在保持源图像语义内容的同时优化目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励引导的方法主要关注图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中如何平衡奖励优化与源图像保真度仍待探索。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种编辑任务中显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线方法，实现了奖励最大化与源图像保真度的更好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了有效的训练免费解决方案，避免了奖励作弊问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态推理的双重性：虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会逐渐损害感知基础，导致视觉遗忘。作者提出了VAPO方法来解决这个问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推理在视觉语言模型中展现出潜力，但研究发现推理过程会逐渐削弱模型对视觉输入的依赖，导致视觉遗忘问题，影响基本视觉问题的识别能力。

Method: 提出了Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和视觉感知能力，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态符号逻辑推理基准MuSLR，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域。评估7个最先进的视觉语言模型发现它们在该任务上表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶和医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严格的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建了MuSLR基准数据集，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域、35种原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 7个最先进的视觉语言模型在MuSLR基准上表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的Chain-of-Thought性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不一致。LogiCAM框架展示了将形式逻辑规则集成到多模态推理中的有效性，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PatchEAD框架，这是一个统一的基于patch的异常检测方法，无需训练即可与多种基础模型兼容，在少样本和零样本设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测越来越依赖基础模型，但现有研究主要关注文本提示调优，而视觉对应部分则分散在各个基础模型的具体处理步骤中。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出了Patch-Exclusive Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD)框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码等视觉提示技术，构建了一个统一的patch聚焦框架。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本设置下性能优于先前工作，尽管没有使用文本特征。研究还分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对patch相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 一个良好统一的仅使用patch的框架可以实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下保持鲁棒性和实时性能。

Method: 使用多摄像头配置，通过初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用标定目标，并在融合前进行色彩校正以确保一致性。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置进行测试，优化后的软件实现了实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠地进行色彩化，成功恢复原本无法检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的LiDAR点云色彩化解决方案，在低光照条件下表现出色，简化了设置流程并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个用于少样本全切片图像分类的分层提示学习框架，通过整合多尺度视觉语义，在实体和切片级别进行联合预测，解决了现有方法无法捕捉组织学实体亚型特异性表型变异的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变异，这限制了少样本全切片图像分类的性能。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成实体级和切片级提示；提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；开发跨尺度实体图学习模块更新实体表示；将精炼的表示聚合为切片级表示并与相应提示对齐；结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能，特别是在捕捉组织学实体的亚型特异性表型变异方面表现出色。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Motivation: 推动视觉语言模型从文本主导的思维链转向图像交互式推理，解决现有方法在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足。

Method: 构建包含31k思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher为"图像思维"范式提供了高质量数据和有效模型，推动了多模态推理的发展，展示了无需外部工具的灵活图像推理能力。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型进入交互式多轮使用，单轮或单模态审核无法应对新的安全风险。在多模态多轮对话中，恶意意图可能分布在多个轮次和图像中，而上下文敏感的回复仍可能推进有害内容。

Method: 构建了MMDS数据集（4,484个标注样本），开发了基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的自动多模态多轮红队框架来生成不安全对话，并提出了LLaVAShield工具进行联合风险检测和评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多轮对话安全提供了系统性框架和工具，通过MMDS数据集和LLaVAShield模型有效应对了新兴的安全挑战。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，采用两阶段训练策略，可作为即插即用模块与任何预训练VLM集成。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了感知感知VLMs的有效灵活范式，弥合了高层推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 论文研究了训练数据特性对对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现数据量和模型规模遵循对数缩放定律，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广泛对抗鲁棒性更为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击，尽管在架构和训练范式方面有所进展。研究旨在了解训练数据特性如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，训练数据集从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放：数据量增加10倍使攻击成功率平均降低约3.2%，模型规模增加10倍使攻击成功率平均降低约13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据集上的表现优于更大但质量较差的数据集。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模可以改善鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广泛对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一的混合专家框架有效解决了多模态多类异常检测中的关键挑战，实现了高效且高性能的检测。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离提示中单个概念重叠过强的区域，转向所有概念能够平衡共存的"纯"联合模式；分析现有多概念引导方案的不稳定权重机制，并调整采样以保持在有利区域

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖率、平衡性和鲁棒性方面均有改进，概念丢失或扭曲的情况更少

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且受数据集病理分布偏差限制。

Method: 构建层次化解剖图，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，结合区域级对比学习增强语义对齐，使用对齐嵌入作为报告生成先验。

Result: 在词汇准确性上提升10%，临床效能提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务上超越领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL无需专家标注即可生成准确且视觉可解释的医学报告，在多项视觉任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: 提出的追踪框架能够有效解决水下鲑鱼场景的跟踪难题，为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法主要局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法难以处理稀疏的真实世界扫描数据，且缺乏标注数据，限制了在复杂3D环境中的精确感知和交互。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线，创建大规模场景级数据集；提出PinPoint3D交互框架，通过用户点点击实现细粒度多粒度分割。

Result: 在首次点击设置下，每个对象部件的平均IoU达到约55.8%；仅需少量额外点击，IoU超过71.3%；相比现有最优方法，IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于视觉相似性优先假设选择上下文示例，但这一假设缺乏充分理论依据；同时Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排序，导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较问题。

Method: 提出RH-Partial2Global方法：1）使用折刀式共形预测构建可靠的替代集合；2）采用覆盖设计采样确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明，RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现出色，性能优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过更可靠的示例选择机制，有效提升了视觉上下文学习的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以适应长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到视频扩散模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存节省，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在长视频编辑中优势更明显，为实时视频处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Conclusion: 叙述监督是学习手部物体分割的有效弱监督方法，WISH模型展示了从自然语言中学习视觉任务的潜力。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，无法适应多样化失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: AgenticIQA框架包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务，动态调用工具收集感知证据。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，实现了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。

Method: 采用统一架构，首先将2D特征提升到规范3D体积空间，设计异构空间融合模块处理失真感知的体积特征，并将传统体素融合重新表述为3D高斯表示，使用可学习潜在高斯球动态适应局部图像纹理。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在去噪早期阶段会产生块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来同时实现噪声抑制和细节保留。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，结合扩散过程（由拉普拉斯算子和强度值引导）和波特性，对灰度图像和彩色图像分别进行去噪处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上，该模型相比现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法在所有情况下都产生了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶非线性PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面优于现有方法，能有效减少块状伪影并保持图像细节和纹理。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段零样本组合图像检索方法，通过交集驱动策略过滤无关背景信息，并使用多模态LLM进行细粒度重排序，在多个数据集上达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带无关背景信息，以及全局余弦相似度无法处理细粒度语义关系。

Method: 两阶段检索：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用低秩适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的SOTA性能，CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理是构建鲁棒且可移植的零样本组合图像检索的通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 遥感基础模型主要关注图像数据，而遥感数据与OpenStreetMap数据在数据结构、内容和空间粒度上存在模态差异，使得有效协同具有挑战性。

Method: GeoLink在预训练阶段利用OSM数据提供多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互，并引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入；在下游任务阶段生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Conclusion: 基于补丁的范式具有灵活性，能够以极高效率实现高质量视频超分辨率，突破了传统方法的计算和分辨率限制。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化问题，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法追求域不变性但可能忽略泛化的因果机制

Method: 使用视觉变换器生成软因果掩码，指导在输入图像中注入空间变化的高斯噪声，背景区域强扰动、前景区域弱扰动

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上表现优于现有OOD基线方法

Conclusion: 因果扰动可作为实现可靠且可解释泛化的有效工具

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的，使得直接图像比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失优化投影。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道提升多模态操纵检测能力，无需重新训练即可显著改善对前景-背景不匹配的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在处理全局场景不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配）时存在明显局限，主要由于标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐问题。

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/人脸分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合。

Result: SGS在无需重新训练的情况下显著提升了HAMMER对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和token级解释能力，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理前景-背景不匹配等全局场景不一致问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [80] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试多模态模型在全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和标题更改），无法处理真实伪造中普遍存在的前景-背景不匹配等全局不一致性问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1生成新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并在三种文本条件下生成标题：字面描述、文本属性和文本分割，形成三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种操作类别的5000个高质量样本，通过质量控制管道确保数据质量。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了全局操作检测的空白，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）提供了更全面的评估基准，有助于提升伪造检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面概念的几何学习方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性影响，避免传统数据增强方法，构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法不够可持续。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来消除对称性，通过优化截面来最大化类别分离，并在对象轮廓数据集上应用该方法处理平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化等对称群。

Result: 提出了一种包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，该方法能够有效测量对称群作用下对象轨道之间的差异。

Conclusion: 这种基于几何概念的简单应用展示了该方法的潜力，具有广泛的应用前景，相关代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签来改进自监督语义占据预测，避免了复杂渲染策略的高计算成本，并在OccNeRF上实现45%的mIoU提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法如新视角合成等计算成本高、内存占用大，且改进难以迁移到其他架构。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，并提出了轻量级模型EasyOcc。

Result: 在OccNeRF上mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（+45%），EasyOcc达到13.86 mIoU，在全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择对自监督学习的全面场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从微妙的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图，需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 使用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，2D关键点通过带注意力机制的LSTM网络处理。基于距离的阈值方法在球接触前分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件的自定义数据集上，模型达到89%测试准确率，比纯视觉和纯姿态基线高出14-22%，推理时间仅22毫秒。

Conclusion: 该轻量级可解释设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析，为点球预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何结构、物体变换以及遵循复杂指令方面的局限性。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行物体检索（涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性），基于隐式和显式布局约束放置物体，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资源检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

TL;DR: 提出EVODiff方法，从信息论角度优化扩散模型推理过程，通过优化条件熵和方差来减少不确定性，显著提升生成质量和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理不一致的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础

Method: 基于信息论视角，提出条件熵优化方法EVODiff，通过数据预测参数化和条件方差优化来系统减少去噪过程中的不确定性

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，相比DPM-Solver++，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重建误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78）；在ImageNet-256上将NFE成本减少25%（从20降到15）；同时改善文本到图像生成并减少伪影

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，EVODiff方法在质量和效率上均优于现有最先进的梯度求解器

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型的创新框架，首次实现了无需微调的主题驱动生成，在保持高质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么需要昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的架构，但推理速度缓慢。视觉自回归模型以其快速采样和强生成质量而闻名，是解决这一矛盾的理想但未被充分探索的基础。

Method: EchoGen采用有效的双路径注入策略，将主题的高层语义身份与低层细粒度细节解耦。使用语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；同时使用内容编码器捕捉复杂视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果验证了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的feed-forward主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为创意AI提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出EntroPE框架，通过条件熵动态检测时间序列中的过渡点并确定补丁边界，解决了传统补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分裂自然过渡，扰乱短期依赖关系并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器(EDP)使用信息论标准定位自然时间变化点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器(APE)使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁方法为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable

Result: 在17个先进MLLMs上的实验有效暴露了模型局限，为未来研究提供了指导。

Conclusion: Human-MME基准测试为MLLMs在人类中心图像理解方面的研究提供了更全面的评估框架，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了行人检测模型在姿态和遮挡方面的公平性，发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向姿态的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响更大。Cascade R-CNN表现最佳，具有最低的漏检率和最小的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，行人检测的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但公平性这一重要问题尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在系统研究行人姿态变化（腿状态、肘状态、身体朝向）和关节遮挡如何影响检测性能。

Method: 评估了5个行人专用检测器（F2DNet、MGAN、ALFNet、CSP、Cascade R-CNN）和3个通用模型（YOLOv12变体），使用ECP-DP数据集，通过EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向姿态的行人存在显著偏见。下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的影响更大。Cascade R-CNN在所有属性中表现出最低的漏检率和最小的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对自动驾驶行人检测的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测器在姿态公平性方面的重要偏差，为开发更公平的行人检测系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于细胞显微镜图像自动多属性标注的新框架，通过CNN和Vision Transformer双模型架构，在细胞类型分类和多属性分类方面达到94.62%的准确率，显著提升模型可解释性和标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，细胞显微镜图像的多属性分类研究相对不足，传统方法主要关注细胞类型分类，而细粒度的多属性标注需要大量人工成本。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集（PBC和WBCAtt），提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类。

Result: 在多属性分类方面达到94.62%的准确率，显著提升了模型可解释性，并相比传统人工标注节省了大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，能够有效自动扩展多属性标注。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法在360度视频中成功实现了文本驱动的显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯基元的稀疏表示进行数据集蒸馏，替代传统的密集像素表示，在相同存储预算下提高数据集多样性和蒸馏性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法依赖密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展。需要更高效的稀疏表示方法来降低计算和存储负担。

Method: 使用少量2D高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子进行并行推理和训练，实现高效渲染。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码和解码成本。

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、可扩展的稀疏表示方法，适用于不同蒸馏流程，显著提升数据集蒸馏性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Conclusion: 该研究提出了评估视频摘要解释合理性的方法，并探索了生成合理文本解释的有效途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预先知道未标注数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息；2) 大多假设训练时已知未标注类别数量，这在现实场景中不实用。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)在概念挖掘和双级表示学习间交替优化；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上实现最先进结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使不知道类别数量，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适合实际开放世界设置，通过多粒度概念挖掘和专家协作显著提升了类别发现性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架IMG，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征、以及可训练目标来实现图像与提示的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成，制定可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的定性和定量评估表明，IMG优于现有对齐方法，并可作为即插即用的适配器增强现有微调方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，无需额外数据或编辑操作，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像与提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型如Donut虽然有效，但对于实时或资源受限应用来说成本过高，需要模型压缩解决方案。

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，进行网络修剪和架构设计。

Result: 开发出Donut-MINT，在DocVQA基准测试上保持强劲性能的同时，显著降低了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实用的视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LAMs存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧间隔较大时模型脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕获结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA系统，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为在线安全和信任的关键挑战，但现有方法受限于高质量数据集的稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符的幻觉解释。

Method: 引入推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: 实验显示PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，达到4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，消融研究进一步证明PRPO在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将多模态推理基于视觉证据的重要性，以实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)方法，用于改进低比特后训练量化(PTQ)的精度，通过聚类特定参数对齐量化输出与全精度输出，无需微调即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特PTQ中会恶化结果，因为对所有输出使用统一的仿射参数集不够有效，需要更精细的方法来减少量化误差。

Method: 提出Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT)框架，使用聚类特定的参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需模型或量化参数微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，该框架在多种架构和低比特设置下持续优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，能够显著改善低比特后训练量化的精度，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3提出了一种基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法，通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失，解决了现有方法中伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点监督方法存在伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来利用点标注进行定向目标检测，减少人工标注成本。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例尺寸，实现标签分配方法的使用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能表现良好。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别是在目标尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创造性结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能达到优秀性能，为弱监督定向目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连续时空3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)的视频超分辨率方法，通过联合建模空间和时间维度，实现了任意时空位置的高质量采样和重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频解耦为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种能同时捕捉精细空间细节和平滑时间动态的连续表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空相干的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经网络编码器预测傅里叶类正弦基系数，支持任意时空位置的采样和抗锯齿重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，证明了连续时空表示在视频处理中的优势。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

### [105] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排来准确捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需任务特定训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索中实现了强大的性能，展示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人类偏好数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，显著提升了指令引导图像编辑任务的质量和人类偏好对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了\mname奖励模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人类偏好数据集进行训练，该数据集由训练有素的专家按照严格协议精心标注。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，能够从噪声数据集中选择高质量子集，训练出的Step1X-Edit模型相比全数据集训练有显著改进。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能够有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，旨在根据任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并建立了ToTG Bench基准和TimeScope框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理长视频时泛化能力有限且难以处理长视频，需要新方法来解决任务导向的时间定位问题。

Method: 提出了TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度的时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下都优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的MLLMs，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope框架能够有效解决任务导向时间定位这一新的挑战性问题，在长视频中准确定位关键信息区间。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专门为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时间缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵和两级缩放机制显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时间缩放方法依赖于频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。需要专门针对此类任务的新框架。

Method: ScalingAR利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在两级缩放级别操作：Profile Level通过融合内在和条件信号流式传输校准的置信状态；Policy Level利用该状态自适应终止低置信度轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；高效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗同时超越基线；在挑战性场景中将性能下降缓解26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功解决了基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成的测试时间缩放问题，通过新颖的熵信号和两级缩放机制，显著提升了生成质量、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA，一种基于MLLM的智能AI工程师，用于通用视频异常检测，无需训练数据或人工干预即可处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和手动调整，面临高人工成本和有限泛化能力的问题，因此需要实现无需训练数据或人工参与的通用异常检测。

Method: 开发PANDA系统，具备四种关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链机制，包括场景感知RAG、潜在异常引导提示策略、渐进反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 大量实验表明，PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中无需训练和人工参与即可实现最先进的性能，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测，能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型，为视频异常检测领域提供了无需训练数据或人工干预的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态

Method: 采用检索增强框架，包括：基于检索的流程提取高级运动特征；上下文学习方法进行运动适应；注意力机制的运动注入适配器

Result: 在多个领域和基础模型上取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持零样本泛化到新领域

Conclusion: 通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，使用高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来预测模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，弥补了传统平均分数评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型间的视觉差异，并设计了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均分数接近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 难度感知的评估方法能够更准确地反映超分辨率模型的真实性能，特别是在处理不同难度图像时的表现差异。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式网络（CENet、SFNet、RNet）结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，有效去除图像中的雨纹和水滴，提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在图像去雨任务中难以同时实现细粒度恢复和全局一致性，需要更有效的多尺度特征聚合方法。

Method: 使用三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet结合HA-UNet和HDMamba进行多尺度特征融合，RNet进行细粒度结构恢复。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了与近期去雨方法相竞争的结果，能够有效学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式多尺度处理和混合域建模，显著提升了图像去雨的性能和图像质量。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时显著降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高难以部署。4位量化面临挑战，因为较大的步长会放大低幅度激活的舍入误差，导致纹理细节丢失。

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，并通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位，从而保持纹理细节。

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上达到FID 6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过平衡异常值保留和LSB精度，有效减少舍入误差并提高量化效率，理论推导和实证评估均证明其在不同激活分布上的通用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持每分钟3.3辆车的处理速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个在工业可部署汽车环境中统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的公开报告系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，能够处理无姿态的内容（从单张图像到多视角集合），并基于单独的参考风格图像进行条件化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格迁移方法通常需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态，限制了其可扩展性和实用性。Stylos旨在实现无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态的3D风格迁移，同时保持几何感知和视角一致的风格化效果。

Method: Stylos采用Transformer主干网络，包含两条路径：几何预测路径保留自注意力以保持几何保真度，风格通过全局交叉注意力注入以强制跨视角的视觉一致性。此外，还引入了基于体素的3D风格损失，将聚合的场景特征与风格统计对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，证明了全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及框架从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性的有效性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过单次前向传播实现了无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态的3D风格迁移，在保持几何保真度的同时实现了视角一致的风格化，具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类）中。传统方法面临复杂空间布局和物体关系的挑战，需要既能保护隐私又具有可解释性的解决方案。

Method: ASGRA框架首先将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系。

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，超越基于图像的方法；在实际儿童性虐待图像评估中达到74.27%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和敏感内容分析的稳健范式，具有固有的可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图）的方法，通过扩散模型后验采样生成与测量一致的布局，并使用对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从移动轨迹重建空间布局是一个不适定问题，因为多个布局可以解释相同的轨迹。现有方法面临前向算子不可逆、不可微导致的优化不稳定问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，使兼容的平面图和轨迹接近，不匹配的远离，从而稳定优化过程。

Result: 实验表明，CoGuide模型从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中定义替代似然分数是真实似然分数的有效近似，能够引导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决了传统方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，不适合在资源受限的边缘环境中部署，需要开发高性能的小型模型来满足边缘计算需求。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程，优化小型模型在Ascend边缘设备上的性能。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在各种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

TL;DR: 提出了DEPTHOR++深度增强框架，通过模拟训练、异常检测和专用网络设计，提升轻量级dToF传感器在真实场景中的深度感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想dToF输入和完美对齐，忽略了校准误差和异常，限制了实际应用。需要解决真实dToF传感器的噪声特性和对齐问题。

Method: 1. 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2. 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误测量；3. 针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集超越L515测量22%。

Conclusion: DEPTHOR++框架显著提升了轻量级dToF传感器在真实场景中的深度感知能力，使低成本传感器性能超越高端设备。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和要求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含四个层次化分类体系的评估框架，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注）。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在事件和摄像机相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练出的自动评估器在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Method: 利用现有的人工标注数据训练机器学习模型，用于自动化校对工作流程，包括引导校对和自动合并分割片段

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能显著降低连接组学的人工校对成本，使更大规模的重建和比较连接组学变得可行

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够对已拍摄图像进行灵活重聚焦，通过任意新的焦点位置和模糊程度来调整景深效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拍摄后景深效果固定且难以修改的问题，特别是当拍摄主体失焦时，需要一种能够灵活调整焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计了扩散变换器框架进行重聚焦学习，使用模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并提出堆叠约束训练方法，基于摄影原理强制模型学习物理正确的景深操作。

Result: 模型能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重聚焦，为摄影和生成式AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的训练约束和模拟数据生成，成功实现了对已拍摄图像的灵活重聚焦，解决了传统摄影中景深效果固定的限制。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法优先处理特定对象或避免不必要的背景声音，限制了在专业Foley工作流程中的应用。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，使用SAGANet模型结合视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控音频合成。

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频生成控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集推动相关研究。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中面临的两个主要挑战：全景数据稀缺导致的零样本泛化能力差，以及球面畸变带来的效率问题。

Method: 1) 开发数据生成引擎，从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征的球面几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合基准测试显示，DA²达到最先进的性能，在AbsRel指标上比最强的零样本基线平均提升38%。令人惊讶的是，DA²甚至优于先前的域内方法。

Conclusion: DA²是一个准确、零样本可泛化且完全端到端的全景深度估计器，在性能和效率上都优于现有方法，展现了卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中重建水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X身体网格和高斯溅射表示，实现照片级真实感的新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际场景应用。HART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，使用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，并用人体对齐网格初始化高斯溅射。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最先进结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离改善18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可以作为现实场景中稳健人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度保持不变，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已对齐到规范坐标系，这会导致网络利用姿态和尺度线索而非推断内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 设计SIM(3)-等变网络架构，包含模块化层：特征规范化、相似性不变几何推理、原始坐标系恢复。

Result: 在去偏评估协议下，PCN基准测试中优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI真实驾驶数据上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D室内扫描上Chamfer距离降低14%。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，即使在更严格的协议下仍优于有偏设置下的竞争对手。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专注于头戴式设备的自我中心数据，包含城市规模、厘米级精度的轨迹标注，用于评估SLAM系统在挑战性场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM基准测试无法充分反映头戴式设备面临的挑战，如更广泛的运动多样性、动态视觉内容、长时间会话和时变传感器校准等问题，且缺乏足够准确的地面真实位姿。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多小时、多公里轨迹，配备多种传感器，并利用测量工具获得厘米级精度的间接位姿标注，支持极端场景（如夜间行走、车辆行驶）的评估。

Result: 实验表明，学术界最先进的SLAM系统在这些挑战性场景下表现不佳，识别了导致性能下降的关键组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在真实世界头戴式设备场景中的鲁棒性提供了重要工具，并设计了不同难度级别的轨迹以支持深入分析。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"连接VLM和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中的多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，需要解耦这两种能力。

Method: 使用多模态kontext（语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略，并构建了涵盖多种多模态参考到图像场景的数据管道。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强大的统一基线方法相当，在某些情况下甚至优于特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext方法成功解耦了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了更有效的架构设计。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Stitch的训练免费方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制整合到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了T2I生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）方面存在持续挑战，且早期方法与现代模型架构不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成的边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接在一起，利用目标注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提高了218%，在PosEval上提高了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了54%的改进。

Conclusion: Stitch实现了最先进的结果，成功将位置控制整合到领先模型中，且无需训练。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTT3R是一种无需训练的3D重建方法，通过测试时训练视角改进循环神经网络的长序列泛化能力，在20FPS下实现2倍姿态估计精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出竞争力，但超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化限制。

Method: 从测试时训练角度重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计为在线学习问题。利用记忆状态与观测之间的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善长度泛化，全局姿态估计比基线提升2倍，以20FPS处理数千张图像仅需6GB GPU内存。

Conclusion: TTT3R通过训练无关的干预有效解决了循环神经网络在长序列3D重建中的泛化问题，实现了高效且鲁棒的在线重建。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [134] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过循环消融方法测试欺骗行为是否可被局部化移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，且这种"神经外科手术"会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是否可被局部化移除，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入"循环消融"方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），且每次消融尝试都导致语言困惑度上升，性能下降。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式和纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，将大语言模型的内部分析与外部分析方法联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接大语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法，寻找无需人工标注数据集就能评估文本质量的参考无关方法。

Method: 验证了一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，在不同LLM层进行测量。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对来自各种来源的文本进行一致排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何指标反映了文本的固有特征而非模型特定伪影，为自动化评估流程提供了无需人工标注的实用文本质量评估方法。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，发现模型在开放场景中更倾向于个人价值而非保护性价值，系统提示能改善对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突时的优先排序能力。

Method: 构建ConflictScope自动管道，从用户定义的价值集中生成价值冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来评估目标模型的自由文本响应。

Result: 模型在开放评估中更支持个人价值而非保护性价值；系统提示能将对齐效果提升14%。

Conclusion: 评估价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为对齐。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了思考监督奖励模型(TRM)，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决RLVR在复杂任务中难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域取得进展，但在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临验证困难。现有方法过度关注忠实度，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: 提出TRM模型，将奖励建模构建为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列。首先评估每个答案句子对支持文档的忠实度，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM纳入策略优化在答案正确性和实用性方面都带来了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过结构化奖励建模过程，鼓励模型批判性评估和利用外部与内部知识，有效提升了复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，缺乏细粒度情感控制

Method: 引入EASPO后训练框架，使用EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，构建自动偏好对，通过逐步偏好优化实现可控情感塑造

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO通过中间去噪步骤的细粒度情感偏好优化，显著提升了情感TTS的性能

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

Motivation: LLM在长篇科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，可以增强答案的事实性，但现有RAG方法无法直接应用于基于科学模拟器的检索。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口实现文本与数值模态转换，以及基于不确定性估计和模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提高30.4%，在事实性上提高16.3%。

Conclusion: SimulRAG有效解决了科学模拟器检索的挑战，显著提升了长篇科学问答的质量和可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报告任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍。主要问题不是虚构实体，而是解释性过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新闻编辑室工作流程中应用增多，但其幻觉倾向对新闻采编的核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）构成风险，需要系统评估。

Method: 使用300份TikTok诉讼和政策相关文档作为语料，在报告式任务中测试三种工具，通过改变提示词特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行标注以测量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，NotebookLM为13%。大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了未经支持的来源描述并将归因观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。需要新闻专用的幻觉分类扩展和强制准确归属的架构设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

Motivation: 虽然大型多语言ASR模型性能显著，但其端到端流程的内部机制，特别是在跨语言公平性和有效性方面仍未被充分探索。

Method: 追踪波束搜索路径，捕捉子词假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子词使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言在正确词元排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好；低资源语言在这些指标上较差，但在子词使用上显示出受类型学影响的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子词探测揭示了被总体错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模下，使用MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他宽松许可数据集，在数学/代码任务上表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 基于宽松许可的风险缓解数据策略为训练能力强的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [144] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准语言模型的置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，这损害了用户信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并对总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更少饱和、更可用的置信度估计。在10次推理调用下，DINCO的表现优于100次调用下的自一致性基线方法。进一步采样无法缩小DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，提供了更可靠和可用的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，用于开放端推理任务，通过模型自我评估生成奖励信号，显著提升推理性能并减少训练资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HealthBench研究中发现，使用模型自身作为评分器并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能显著改善推理性能，且训练后的模型也会成为更强的评分器。

Method: 引入自我奖励的评分标准强化学习框架，使用模型自身生成奖励信号进行训练，仅需少量样本即可实现高效训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000个HealthBench Easy样本训练，就能在HealthBench Hard上超越GPT-5。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架实现了更快、更资源高效的训练，同时超越了基线方法，为开放端评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR是一个新颖的多语言推理强化学习框架，使用高性能英语LLM作为支点模型生成参考回答，通过语义等价性奖励将推理能力跨语言迁移，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在大型语言模型中主要局限于英语的问题，缩小不同语言间的性能差距，构建真正多语言推理代理。

Method: 采用支点式强化学习与语义可验证奖励，使用英语LLM生成参考回答，通过基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数来训练多语言模型。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B上分别提升多语言平均性能16.41%和10.17%，显著优于传统PPO基线。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法来构建多语言推理代理，有效缩小了英语与其他语言之间的性能差距。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前的空主语阶段频繁省略主语的现象，特别是英语儿童混淆祈使句和陈述句的问题。

Method: 提出新的计算参数测量误解，并整合到义务主语语法学习的模拟模型中，使用修改版的变分学习器处理超集-子集语言。

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，表明性能影响确实会促进临时空主语语法。

Conclusion: 本研究为整合计算模型研究语法习得提供了框架，同时考虑了其他关键发展因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson）这一新的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于Pearson ρ和Kendall τ的机器翻译元评估方法存在的局限性，特别是在处理分数分布和段内比较方面的问题。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段的成对差异信息，通过段内成对差异来改进全局Pearson方法，实现更稳健的分数分布理解。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析显示，PDP能够正确排序评估指标，并且比先前工作更好地与人类错误权重对齐。噪声注入分析证明了PDP对随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一个鲁棒的机器翻译元评估指标，能够有效处理各种偏差，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格对齐任务中的数据效率，探索达到风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索。

Method: 通过研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的对齐数据效率，定义模型性能极限并确定达到风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量。

Result: 该研究为视觉语言模型的风格对齐能力提供了基准，明确了在有限数据下实现风格饱和的可能性。

Conclusion: 通过数据效率研究可以更好地理解小规模视觉语言模型在风格对齐任务中的能力和局限，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG（无奖励引导）方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过增强模型和参考模型的似然比参数化过程奖励，在数学推理和代码生成任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步引导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤提供密集标注的过程奖励，这在扩散模型中难以实现，因为其生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过增强模型和参考扩散大语言模型的似然比来参数化过程奖励，增强模型可以通过现成的经过强化学习或监督微调的扩散模型获得，无需额外奖励模型。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上均取得显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer架构处理任意大量上下文标记的能力，从数学上统一分析其表达能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射。

Method: 将Transformer视为概率测度间的映射，通过前推操作表示上下文映射，分析其Frechet导数的正则性和支撑基数保持特性。

Result: 完全刻画了可以通过Transformer表示的测度间映射的特性，证明了Transformer能通用近似具有任何连续上下文映射的表示，并能近似Vlasov方程的解映射。

Conclusion: Transformer架构与Vlasov流之间存在深刻的数学联系，无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架这些话题来塑造公众观点。然而，大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取技术，提取结构化注释（包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和重大事件），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 开发了一个包含15万+文章的数据集和交互式网络平台，能够在句子、文章和出版商多个层面量化报道维度，揭示新闻覆盖和偏见的模式。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复的大规模媒体偏见研究方法，为未来研究提供实证资源，支持学术研究和提高媒体问责制的实际努力。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个包含1,761对魁北克法语最小对立对的语料库，用于评估LLMs在20种语法现象上的语言学知识。研究发现模型能力随规模增长，但在需要深层语义理解的现象上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语主要语法现象上的语言学知识，并与人类表现进行比较。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方资源手动修改句子创建最小对立对，由12名母语者标注语法性，通过比较LLMs对最小对中句子的概率分配来评估能力。

Result: 语法能力随模型规模提升，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法理解上存在关键限制，特别是在语义理解方面，与人类能力有明显差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基准和谐度概念，用于衡量模型在基准测试各子领域性能的均匀分布程度，指出高和谐度是可靠评估的重要指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在反馈循环问题：强基准驱动模型发展，而更好的模型需要更具区分度的基准。为确保评估的可信度和进展的意义，需要提高基准的可靠性。

Method: 从分布角度研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度来衡量模型在基准子领域间性能的均匀分布。在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上进行实验，将基准映射到基于模型计算的和谐度均值-方差平面上。

Result: 分析显示，和谐度较低的基准可能产生误导性结果，因为整体准确率可能被特定子领域不成比例地影响。例如ARC-Easy基准被生物概念问题主导，掩盖了地理、物理、化学等其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均重新定义为更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量方法。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性，而基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深度嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，采用双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，使用对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见的同时保留语言建模能力方面优于现有方法。去偏权重可在模型变体间转移。

Conclusion: 偏见表示在预训练期间固化并在微调阶段持续存在，BiasUnlearn通过有效的去偏机制成功减轻偏见同时保持模型核心能力。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

TL;DR: 提出LD-MoLE方法，用可学习的动态路由机制替代传统TopK路由，实现自适应、依赖token和分层级的专家分配，在多个基准测试中达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优且为每个token分配固定数量的专家，限制了模型的灵活性和性能。

Method: 使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代不可微分的TopK选择，允许模型自适应确定每层每个token激活的专家数量，并引入分析性稀疏控制目标来正则化激活专家数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中获得了最高的平均分数，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习token依赖和分层级专家分配的能力，为参数高效微调与专家混合的结合提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据集，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握了数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆了训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 四个主要数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、使用形式数学语言的前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力的表现存在显著差异，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互影响关系。

Conclusion: 将数学智能解耦为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

*Zihao Zhao,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去识别化和HIPS理论的隐私保护合成文本生成方法，通过实体感知控制码来引导可控生成，在保持隐私保护的同时确保文本实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、社会服务和法律等高风险领域，文本匿名化对于负责任地开发和部署AI至关重要，需要平衡隐私保护与数据实用性。

Method: 使用实体感知控制码来引导可控生成，提供两种变体：基于上下文学习的变体确保与底层去识别系统一致的隐私级别，基于前缀调优的变体采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法律和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了一个实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 提出CATCH框架，通过渐进式对话合成和记忆驱动动态规划，提升AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询研究采用一次性生成方法，导致治疗保真度低且无法捕捉每个回应的决策逻辑

Method: 渐进式对话合成策略提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲；记忆驱动动态规划整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理；多智能体优化器为每个对话轮次添加显式思维链

Result: 广泛实验和人工评估表明CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在保真度和决策逻辑方面的局限性

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Conclusion: 为专业领域构建指令和强化数据集提供了可扩展解决方案，显著减少对人工标注的依赖，同时保持高技术保真度。

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个强化学习框架，直接优化大语言模型的真实性，通过三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案。这两种极端都损害了真实性，需要一种能平衡事实准确性和不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL框架，采用简单的三元奖励机制，激励模型不仅提供正确答案，还能在不确定时弃权，从而减少幻觉。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下都表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都取得了强劲性能，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于语言模型的自动抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，重点关注性别和种族/族裔相关的社会人口统计学差异，比较了深度神经网络嵌入与少样本学习方法的性能和公平性，并探索了减轻偏见的公平感知技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见问题，特别是针对不同性别和种族/族裔群体的公平性差异，旨在开发更公平的抑郁症检测方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络嵌入模型与少样本学习的大语言模型进行比较，在DAIC-WOZ临床访谈数据集上评估性能和公平性。应用公平感知损失函数到DNN模型，探索LLMs中的上下文学习、不同提示框架和样本数量。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类中优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔等代表性不足群体中表现更好。LLMs显示较少的性别偏见，但种族差异仍然存在。最差群体损失在DNN模型中实现了性能与公平性的更好平衡。在LLMs中，伦理框架的引导提示有助于在1-shot设置中减轻性别偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在抑郁症检测中表现出更好的性能和更少的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。公平感知技术如最差群体损失可以有效缓解DNN模型中的偏见，而增加样本数量并不能有效减少LLMs中的种族差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset

approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of

Result: 实验表明ReTAG在提高响应质量的同时显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: ReTAG通过检索增强和主题增强的图框架有效解决了全局意义理解中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用无批评强化学习和可验证奖励的大规模推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，即生成长推理路径却无性能提升。现有的长度惩罚方法由于轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出DECS框架，包含：(1) 首个解耦的token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；(2) 新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS实现了推理token减少超过50%的显著效果，同时保持甚至提升了性能。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

TL;DR: 该论文提出评估视觉语言模型生成解释的两个质量评分函数——视觉保真度和对比性，以帮助用户在看不到视觉上下文时更好地判断模型预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时（如盲人和低视力用户），VLM预测的自然语言解释可能误导用户相信不准确的预测。需要解决用户对VLM预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出两个解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与合理替代方案的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估。

Result: 质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将参与者预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不正确预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对VLM预测的适当依赖，特别是在用户无法访问视觉上下文的情况下。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Conclusion: 需要细粒度、人工验证的基准来检测和修正领域特定上下文中的科学虚构问题，这对LLM作为评判者的评估范式提出了担忧。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a

multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

TL;DR: 论文提出了RoleConflictBench基准，用于评估大语言模型在角色冲突这种复杂社会困境中的上下文敏感性。研究发现LLMs对情境线索的敏感性不足，决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要上下文敏感性来识别和权衡情境线索。

Method: 引入RoleConflictBench基准，采用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地改变相关期望和情境紧急程度。分析了10个不同LLMs的模型选择。

Result: LLMs显示出对上下文线索的一定响应能力，但这种敏感性不足。决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及对男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的明显优先考虑。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在角色冲突情境中的决策受固有社会偏见主导，而非情境信息，这凸显了需要改进模型在复杂社会困境中的上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算高效的文本个性化质量评估方法PerQ，用于替代依赖多个大语言模型的元评估方法，有效降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的专用指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，但这种方法成本高昂且受模型内部偏见影响。

Method: 开发了名为PerQ的计算高效方法，专门用于评估语言模型生成文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过比较大小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: PerQ方法能有效减少资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，通过训练智能体有效管理复杂记忆系统来解决LLM智能体在长上下文信息理解中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于记忆增强的智能体依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型缺乏确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新的能力，导致次优记忆构建和信息丢失。

Method: 提出强化学习框架Mem-alpha，构建专门训练数据集，智能体通过处理序列信息块学习提取和存储相关内容，然后更新记忆系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有记忆增强智能体基准上取得显著改进，尽管仅在最多30k token的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列，超过训练长度的13倍。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架展示了通过强化学习训练智能体管理复杂记忆系统的有效性，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了KERN路由函数，一种基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的FFN风格路由器，作为Softmax路由器的替代方案，在MoE模型中实现零额外成本改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由函数，但这更多是历史惯例而非有原则的设计选择。作者发现MoE和FFN都可以解释为Nadaraya-Watson回归的特例，这启发了新的路由器设计。

Method: 提出KERN路由函数，基于FFN架构，使用ReLU激活和l2归一化，无需额外计算成本即可替代Softmax路由器。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提FFN风格路由函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器，为MoE模型提供了更灵活和有效的路由选择。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

TL;DR: 研究了多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的适应性，发现它们在简单设置中的良好表现不能很好地泛化到跨语言或更复杂的结构化任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，但很少应用于序列标注任务，且主要在简单任务上进行测试。

Method: 研究多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖性的标注任务中的适应性，并进行跨语言评估。

Result: 发现这些架构在简单设置中观察到的强大性能不能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也不能扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注中的表现受任务复杂性影响，需要更全面的评估来理解其适用性。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无参考GEC评估指标虽然与人工评估相关性高，但无法有效评估旨在获取不合理高分的对抗系统，这会影响自动评估的可靠性并误导用户选择GEC系统。

Method: 针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标，提出对抗攻击策略，构建对抗系统。

Result: 开发的对抗系统在四种指标上都超过了当前最先进水平，成功获得了不合理的高分。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现有无参考GEC评估指标存在脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的评估方法来确保自动评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，在4K样本上训练的7B-24B模型超越了使用2.4M样本的70B+通用奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，优先考虑回答的基于上下文的准确性而非风格特征，训练专门针对RAG的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 使用4K样本训练的7B-24B参数RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，比使用2.4M样本的70B+通用模型绝对提升15.5%。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效创建RAG专用偏好数据集，训练的小型专用奖励模型在RAG评估任务上优于大型通用模型，证明了领域专用训练的重要性。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集，用于提升LLMs在中文语法错误纠正中的表现

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了LLMs在思维链提示下的忠实性问题，发现提示中的线索会显著影响模型推理的准确性和透明度，模型倾向于依赖线索作为答案捷径，而非进行真正的推理计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探究LLMs生成的思维链推理是否真正忠实于底层计算过程，还是仅仅受到提示中嵌入的答案线索影响而形成的后验叙述。

Method: 采用控制线索操作的系统实验设计，涵盖四个数据集、两个先进模型，以及不同正确性、呈现风格和复杂度的结构化线索条件，评估任务准确性和线索在推理中的明确承认情况。

Result: 正确线索显著提高准确性，错误线索降低准确性；方程类线索常被明确引用，原始线索常被默默采用；奉承风格促进明确承认，泄露风格提高准确性但促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性地受到线索捷径的影响，这掩盖了推理过程的忠实性，揭示了模型推理可能更多依赖提示中的捷径而非真实计算过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在实际部署中受到知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制的约束，而外部搜索工具的集成又面临复杂搜索环境中查询微小变化导致推理偏差的问题。

Method: RE-Searcher方法在搜索过程中明确表述具体搜索目标，并对检索到的证据是否满足该目标进行反思，结合目标导向规划和自我反思。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果，扰动研究证明了对噪声或误导外部信号的强大韧性。

Conclusion: 该方法为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中提供了实用指导，有助于实现更自主的决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要关注英语，导致现有检测器几乎无法用于非英语语言，仅依赖跨语言迁移能力。中欧语言的检测研究很少，跨语言迁移能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提供了首个针对中欧地区的检测方法基准，比较了不同训练语言组合的性能，进行了多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，并分析了检测方法的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最佳，同时对这些语言的对抗混淆攻击也最具抵抗力。

Conclusion: 填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的研究空白，为相关领域提供了重要的基准和性能评估。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过设计器和执行器组件，根据任务需求和实时反馈自适应构建和调整推理过程，显著提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务适应性；少数自动化方法通常绑定特定数据集，且对中间反馈利用不足，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度受限。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件：设计器将复杂问题分解为子目标序列，基于中间输出动态规划下一步；执行器使用动态操作符执行每个操作，支持上下文感知参数化。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题求解和代码生成等多个领域评估显示，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，在Pass@k指标上取得大幅提升，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成和自适应调整机制，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的LLM智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估者在任务评估中的可靠性问题，发现其判断可能基于提示中的捷径而非真实质量，影响评估的公正性。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench数据集构建100对比较任务，通过GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估者，在保持提示其他部分不变的情况下注入来源身份和时间新旧线索。

Result: 两个模型都表现出明显的时间偏见（偏好新回答）和来源层次偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），GPT-4o在主观性强的LitBench领域偏见更明显，且很少承认这些线索的影响。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为评估者的系统容易受捷径影响且不忠实，削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估者的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对LLM与人类偏好对齐至关重要，但偏好数据成本高昂，现有文本数据合成方法计算开销大

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成多样且语义一致的合成偏好对

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准上显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强提升奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Conclusion: IMProofBench将作为动态基准与数学界合作持续发展，确保其对评估下一代LLMs的相关性。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will

### [186] [Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093)
*Xiaoyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RSO框架，通过分层策略优化改进对话推荐系统，将响应生成分解为宏观策略规划和微观专家网络适应，使用强化学习解决多轮对话数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习框架。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在偏好和事实专家指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: 实验显示RSO优于现有最先进基线，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过解耦策略规划和响应生成，实现了更易处理的学习，解决了多轮对话数据限制问题。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Motivation: 开发能够从大量产品评论中提取关键信息并生成易于理解的摘要的系统，帮助消费者快速了解产品优缺点。

Method: 首先从单个评论中提取和整合方面-情感对，为每个产品选择最频繁的方面并采样代表性评论，然后构建结构化提示来引导LLM生成基于实际客户反馈的摘要。

Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate
concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform.
Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from
individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and
samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time
deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer
reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated
summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

*Christian Herold,Michael Kozielski,Nicholas Santavas,Yannick Versley,Shahram Khadivi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种算法来扩展预训练LLM的词汇表，通过添加领域特定token来解决词汇不匹配问题，从而减少token数量并降低推理延迟，同时保持预测质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配会导致领域特定术语被拆分成多个子词，增加token数量和处理速度下降。

Method: 设计算法扩展现有分词器的词汇表，保证分词效率不会降低，每个输入序列的分词数量最多与原来相同。

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，减少下游任务的推理延迟，同时保持预测质量。

Conclusion: 词汇适应不仅能提高处理效率，还能带来更广泛的好处，如影响前向传播速度和模型对新token的采用率。

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索竞争如何影响基于LLM的多智能体系统行为，特别是极端压力下出现的不可靠、有害行为如何破坏协作和任务性能。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，在零和竞争环境中模拟多智能体辩论，测试不同LLM和任务，并引入不同变体的裁判来研究环境反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为并降低了任务性能，导致讨论偏离正轨；客观、任务导向的反馈能有效缓解过度竞争行为。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI社区中涌现的社会动态，为理解和治理多智能体系统的竞争行为提供了重要见解，并形成了顶级LLM的领导者榜单。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are
being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for

extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative

Result: 在多个域外数据集上，VietBinoculars在准确率、F1分数和AUC三个指标上均超过99%，优于原始Binoculars模型、传统检测方法及其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，显著优于包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT在内的商业工具。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路由规划，OCVRP问题涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆寻找最优配送路线，且车辆完成配送后无需返回仓库

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现：基于自然启发的元启发式算法ACO和行业标准优化工具包Google OR-Tools，使用自定义数据集进行性能评估

Result: ACO在路由参数方面具有灵活性，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、更一致且需要更少的输入

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

Motivation: 现实知识图谱中经常出现新实体，且显式类型信息往往缺失或不完整，现有方法难以处理这种情况。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，使用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示，捕捉隐含类型信号，进行子图建模的归纳链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下超越了最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型可以有效增强节点表示，为类型信息稀缺的知识图谱链接预测提供有力解决方案。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态增强退火（DBA）的高效通用微调方法，通过零学习率训练获得全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，仅使用领域数据即可避免模型崩溃，显著提升性能并大幅减少GPU时间。

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验才能获得最佳泛化性能，为了解决这些挑战并简化训练过程。

Method: 通过零学习率训练在通用数据上获得全局梯度，在领域训练中用于梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅依赖领域数据的微调流程。

Result: 在多个流行基础模型的各种任务上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效且通用的微调解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火过程，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Motivation: 研究旨在开发能够实现稳健和一致生成的语音语言模型，通过语义初始化和规划损失来平衡声学稳定性和语义基础。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音标记，应用轻量对齐损失，并通过稀疏化和辅助目标训练模型，包括0.7B和1.0B纯语音模型以及1.0B文本-语音交错模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现最高一致性，超越更大系统；交错模型改善了词汇和句法探测以及语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。

Conclusion: LM侧的设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需更改标记器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics工具包填补了AI模型人格评估工具的空白，能够追踪人格变化并分析反馈数据集的影响，有助于提高模型评估的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OTR的新微调算法，将监督微调与策略梯度方法结合，通过单步强化学习轨迹处理每个token生成，利用监督数据中的真实token提供奖励信号，显著提升了语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的是SFT使用固定的预收集数据，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: OTR算法将自回归学习过程重新构建为单步强化学习轨迹，在每个步骤中从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态的离线监督数据转化为动态的在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: OTR为微调大语言模型提供了一个强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B的潜在思维过程，发现正确与错误答案的潜在思维模式具有显著差异，提出了基于潜在分类器的潜在思维优化方法LTO，能有效改进LLM的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的链式思维推理计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思维架构缺乏可解释性和监督机制，难以确保推理过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出潜在思维优化(LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化潜在思维过程，通过检测错误思维模式来改进推理。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思维模式，LTO能显著改进潜在思维过程，且该方法可泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 与语言思维相比，在潜在空间中进行奖励建模和扩展测试时思维监督是一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法，具有改进LLM思维过程的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

*Chengyue Wu,Hao Zhang,Shuchen Xue,Shizhe Diao,Yonggan Fu,Zhijian Liu,Pavlo Molchanov,Ping Luo,Song Han,Enze Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2将预训练的自回归大语言模型转换为块扩散语言模型，仅需约10亿token微调即可实现并行文本生成，比传统扩散LLM减少500倍训练数据，解码速度提升2.5倍且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型虽然性能优异，但其顺序解码机制限制了推理效率。需要一种方法在保持模型性能的同时实现并行生成，提高推理速度。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）以及并行解码流水线，实现高效的并行生成。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确率上达到或超过自回归基线，同时实现扩散LLM中最先进的效率，解码速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出了重要一步，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

*Jinyeop Song,Song Wang,Julian Shun,Yada Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习优化的知识图谱检索增强生成框架，使用单一智能体与知识图谱交互，相比多模块方法更高效且具有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG-RAG系统通常包含多个LLM模块（如规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本高且行为与特定知识图谱绑定，缺乏效率和通用性。

Method: 采用强化学习训练单一智能体，使其能够与知识图谱环境交互，在每一步进行检索并将检索信息融入推理和生成过程，实现端到端优化。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了比使用更大基础模型或微调模型的多模块方法更高的答案准确率。

Conclusion: KG-R1展示了高效性和可迁移性，训练后无需修改即可在新知识图谱上保持强准确性，是现实部署的有前景的KG-RAG框架。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实性评估语言表达与现实世界信息的关联程度，对事实核查至关重要。但由于真实性依赖于多种语言信号且概念复杂，需要开发系统的标注方案。

Method: 开发了一个结合多种先前工作的复杂多层面真实性标注方案，在希伯来语议会话语领域手动标注了近5000个句子，并测试了自动预测方案特征的各种方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，并成功将标注扩展到大型语料库，验证了标注方案的可行性。

Conclusion: 该真实性标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为事实核查和语言真实性研究提供了系统化的框架。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)在自动项目对齐中的表现，发现包含更多项目文本数据能显著提升模型性能，且微调SLMs在细粒度技能对齐方面优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目对齐是测试开发中收集内容效度证据的关键步骤，传统由人类专家进行，但这一判断过程可能主观且耗时。

Method: 使用来自大学入学标准化阅读和写作测试的数据，训练不同的小型语言模型进行领域和技能级别的对齐，其中10个技能映射到4个内容领域。同时训练基于多语言E5-large-instruct模型嵌入的监督机器学习模型进行比较。

Result: 包含更多项目文本数据比单纯增加样本量带来更大的性能提升。微调SLMs在技能对齐方面持续优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。语义相似性分析显示SAT和PSAT中某些技能语义过于接近，这解释了观察到的错误分类。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动项目对齐方面表现优异，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务上，为测试开发中的自动化对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法存在属性间相互依赖的挑战，且需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了灵活性

Method: 使用训练自由的框架，将任务重构为顺序属性控制的规划问题，采用定制化的蒙特卡洛树搜索进行渐进式属性调整

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了强大的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线

Conclusion: PACO框架能够有效满足所有约束条件，在小模型上达到大模型的可控性水平，在大模型上表现更优

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

TL;DR: CreAgentive是一个基于智能体工作流的创意生成引擎，通过故事原型和三层工作流解决LLM在创意写作中的四个关键限制：体裁多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：体裁多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三层智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段基于原型生成多体裁文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以低成本（每100章节少于1美元）生成了数千个质量稳定的章节，在10个叙事指标上持续优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流有效解决了长文本生成的瓶颈，实现了高质量、多体裁的创意内容生成，在质量和长度两个维度上都表现出色。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性问题，避免传统方法中繁重且领域特定的特征工程，探索统一模型在多语言、多平台上的适用性。

Method: 使用基于T5Gemma初始化的300M参数回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本预测数值结果，无需特征工程。

Result: 在APPS竞赛编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩>0.5；在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得0.46的最高平均Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: 单一统一的回归语言模型能够有效预测多种代码执行指标，在多语言和多硬件平台上表现优异，超越了传统图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的替代方案具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分开发，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，强制模型在更短时间内并行地对掩码令牌达到高确定性，同时遵循原始采样轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，dParallel显著减少解码步骤而不损失性能。应用于LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型时，在GSM8K上将解码步骤从256减少到30（8.5倍加速），在MBPP上从256减少到24（10.5倍加速）。

Conclusion: dParallel成功解锁了扩散大语言模型的并行解码能力，实现了显著的推理加速，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估AI智能体处理复杂信息、利用多样化资源和管理动态用户交互的能力，需要构建更贴近真实世界复杂性的评估框架。

Method: 基于日常应用场景构建模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略实现场景和工具的灵活组合，创建跨场景和单场景任务，并提出了基于评分标准的滑动窗口评估器。

Result: 评估显示即使最先进的模型在跨场景任务中成功率仅为30%，在其他任务中成功率也不到50%，表明现有AI智能体在处理复杂现实任务时仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: VitaBench将为实际应用中AI智能体的发展提供有价值的资源，推动智能体在复杂现实环境中的能力提升。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLMs的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控TTS的发展。

Method: 提出受"操作主义"启发的解耦范式，开发BatonTTS模型专门用于从文本化声学特征生成语音。

Result: BatonVoice在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越开源和闭源基线，并实现了显著的零样本跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本化声学特征能更有效地释放LLMs的语言智能。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过在训练时系统性地改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型能够在推理时弹性调整计算预算而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器的MoE模型在推理时改变激活专家数量会导致性能急剧下降，限制了MoE模型的弹性推理潜力。

Method: M-MoE框架在训练时强制模型学习专家有意义的排序：顶级专家提供粗粒度能力，后续专家添加细粒度细节。采用分层随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在多种专家数量下都能保持优异性能，接近多个专用模型的效果，但训练成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更灵活和实用的解决方案，支持弹性推理和计算预算优化分配。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

TL;DR: OceanGym是首个面向海洋水下具身智能体的综合基准平台，旨在推动AI在极端水下环境中的发展，包含8个真实任务领域和基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境具有低能见度、动态洋流等极端感知和决策挑战，使得智能体部署异常困难，需要专门的基准测试平台来推动相关技术发展。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型驱动的统一智能体框架，整合感知、记忆和序列决策能力，要求智能体理解光学和声纳数据，在复杂环境中自主探索并完成长期目标。

Result: 广泛实验显示，当前最先进的MLLM驱动智能体与人类专家之间存在显著差距，特别是在感知、规划和适应性方面仍面临持续挑战。

Conclusion: OceanGym通过提供高保真、严格设计的平台，为开发鲁棒具身AI建立了测试平台，并将这些能力转移到真实世界的自主水下航行器，标志着向地球最后未开发领域智能操作迈出了决定性一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

TL;DR: 提出了首个为语音转文本生成模型获取对比解释的方法，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择，在语音翻译性别分配案例中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比解释在可解释AI中被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但目前为语音转文本生成模型获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响在替代输出之间的选择来获取对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译性别分配的案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释范围扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染，并允许精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入规模控制方面不足，且容易受到数据污染影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。模型经常做出语法有效但参数值错误的函数调用。

Conclusion: 引入简单的缓解策略，在每一步明确重述先前变量值，可显著提升模型性能，如GPT-5成功率从62.5%提升至81.3%。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

TL;DR: MT-breaker是一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本来增加翻译难度的方法，能生成既自然又具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数例子对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点。

Method: 使用大语言模型迭代查询目标机器翻译模型，逐步优化源文本以增加翻译难度，同时保持文本的自然性和多样性。

Result: 该方法生成的测试用例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，且难度能迁移到其他模型和语言，同时保持了自然文本的多样性。

Conclusion: MT-breaker通过模拟人类专家探测模型失败的迭代过程，成功创建了既自然又具有挑战性的机器翻译测试基准。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自偏问题，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为可扩展的替代方案，但这些生成的测试集存在关键缺陷。

Method: 通过分析LLM作为测试集和LLM作为评估器两种方式，研究自偏的来源和影响因素，包括模型在源语言的生成能力和源文本多样性。

Result: 发现自偏源于生成的测试数据和评估方法的组合效应；模型在源语言的生成能力影响自偏程度；源文本多样性低是自偏的原因之一。

Conclusion: 提高生成源文本的多样性可以缓解观察到的自偏问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM的多语言响应质量，创建了包含6423个人工标注偏好的数据集，在47种语言中评估了LLM评判者的表现，并通过强化学习等方法提升了评判能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型在多语言环境中产生接近母语质量的响应具有挑战性，需要开发有效的评估框架。

Method: 引入MENLO评估框架，创建人工标注的数据集，使用零样本LLM评判者，并应用强化学习、奖励塑造和多任务学习进行改进。

Result: 零样本LLM评判者从成对评估和结构化标注标准中获益，但仍不如人工标注者；通过微调方法显著提升了评判能力；RL训练的评判者可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，但LLM评判者与人类判断之间仍存在差异。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏针对性、难以产生具有科学价值贡献的问题，专注于应对紧迫的人类定义挑战。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设、验证、分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现逐步超越人类最先进水平的发现，真正推动科学发现前沿，所有实验日志和系统代码将开源。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

TL;DR: 该论文提出将寻找最具挑战性NLP测试数据的问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，其中每个主题是一个臂，通过有限的计算预算高效识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难的主题计算成本过高，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将寻找困难主题任务形式化为多臂老虎机问题，每个主题对应一个臂，通过拉臂（采样实例并评估难度）来识别最困难的主题，比较了多种老虎机策略。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更高效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为在有限计算预算下高效识别NLP测试中最困难主题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用SSL语音模型提取的高帧率标记，但Transformer的自注意力机制处理长序列时计算成本高昂。音节级语音标记化提供了更可解释且可能更可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 对音节级语音标记化进行系统性研究，在不同训练数据规模下评估模型在一系列SLU基准测试上的表现。

Result: 音节标记能够匹配甚至超越传统高帧率标记的性能，同时显著降低训练和推理成本，训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在不同随机种子训练下呈现四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、快速收敛阶段、快速发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段。大模型在后期训练中再收敛更快，而小模型无法真正再收敛。不同语言类别的收敛速度不均，高频词和功能词比低频词和内容词收敛更快更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子训练下的收敛行为，探索模型大小和训练阶段对学习分布稳定性的影响。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下每token的KL散度期望值来衡量语言模型的收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、token频率和词性标签对收敛模式的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式，发现大模型在后期训练中再收敛更快，小模型无法真正再收敛。高频词和功能词比低频词和内容词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小对学习稳定分布至关重要，不同语言类别的收敛行为存在显著差异，这些因素共同影响模型训练中学到分布的稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Conclusion: 研究倡导更严格的基准构建，并将KGQAGen定位为推动KGQA评估的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Motivation: 当前制作交互式3D打印对象需要繁琐的3D设计和后期电子元件安装，多材料3D打印技术为解决这一问题提供了机会。

Method: 用户定义3D对象表面的触摸区域，系统自动生成连接这些区域的导电路径，优化电阻-电容延迟以实现每个区域的独特识别。

Result: 通过五个计算和传感性能评估（单线连接平均准确率达93.35%）和六个应用示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该传感技术支持现有应用（如原型制作），并凸显了完全通过3D打印生产交互设备的潜力。

Abstract: Producing interactive 3D printed objects currently requires laborious 3D
design and post-instrumentation with off-the-shelf electronics. Multi-material
3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these
challenges. We present a computational design pipeline that embeds multiple
capacitive touchpoints into any 3D model that has a closed mesh without
self-intersection. With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D
object's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then
automatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This
path is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region
is touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a
double-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility
with five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35%
mean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples. Our sensing
technique supports existing uses (e.g., prototyping) and highlights the growing
promise to produce interactive devices entirely with 3D printing.

Motivation: 传统线性降阶建模的精度受限于固定的线性化降阶映射，无法适应动态变化的变形状态，需要更灵活的适应性策略。

Method: 采用自适应策略使降阶映射随变形状态动态变化，结合历史位移基和Grassmann插值处理大变形，保持计算成本相近。

Result: 通过定量在线误差分析和与基于PCA的线性降阶模拟的定性比较，证明该方法在保持计算成本的同时显著提高了精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了线性降阶建模在处理动态变形和大变形问题时的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Linear reduced-order modeling (ROM) is widely used for efficient simulation
of deformation dynamics, but its accuracy is often limited by the fixed
linearization of the reduced mapping. We propose a new adaptive strategy for
linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to
the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over
traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we
introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann
interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging
scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis
and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based
linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while
preserving comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: MoReFlow提供了一个无需配对数据的灵活运动重定向框架，能够处理多样化角色并保持领域特定目标，在动画和机器人应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data
for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have
approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion
datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow
behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of
retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in
animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose
MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that
learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method
consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each
character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we
employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces
across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned
matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow
enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data.
Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across
diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability,
generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Conclusion: 3DiFACE成功解决了语音驱动3D面部动画中的多样性和可控编辑问题，为创建个性化动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图解决方法主要依赖视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中缺乏语义指导。本文探索利用自然语言描述为拼图提供语义引导。

Method: 提出视觉-语言层次语义对齐(VLHSA)模块，通过多级语义匹配将视觉块与文本描述对齐，结合双视觉编码器和语言特征进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，拼图准确率提升14.2个百分点，消融研究证实VLHSA模块的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图解决建立了新范式，证明了语言语义在视觉拼图任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理时优化方法Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)，通过利用最近logits的谱和熵特性来动态调制token分布，无需更新模型参数即可提高LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: SLS维护一个top-K logits的滑动缓冲区，执行在线奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应地重新缩放logits，仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS在数学、编程和科学推理任务中始终优于现有基线方法，实现了更高的准确性。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的轻量级推理时优化方法，能够在不更新模型参数的情况下提高LLM的可靠性，同时保持上下文一致性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有的图自监督学习方法（如GRACE）由于依赖非多项式操作，与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，限制了在隐私敏感场景中的应用。

Method: 设计了完全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的新型对比损失函数，使整个框架能够与同态加密技术兼容。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在CiteSeer数据集上性能优于标准非隐私基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，为隐私敏感场景下的图学习应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在双曲流形上有效，能够加速训练收敛，特别是在参数远离最优解的早期阶段，且可推广到欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对强降雨预测的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强对罕见强降雨事件的表征，显著提升了强降雨预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强降雨预测对社会至关重要，但降水数据分布高度不平衡（大部分无雨或小雨，强降雨罕见），这种长尾分布阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，提出DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表征。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基线数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为强降雨预测建立了有效的长尾学习范式，为增强早期预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态和不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差。需要开发能够自适应优化边界并动态处理时序变化的AI方法。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界，并基于注意力模式自适应优化；设计时序专家混合模块，通过离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家。

Result: 实验结果显示，在全局和区域预报、极端事件预测和集合预报四个任务中，STCast均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时序处理，显著提升了区域天气预报的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将神经网络VWAP执行策略从固定持续时间订单推广到执行持续时间在最小和最大时间范围内受限的场景，类似于股票回购合同结构。

Method: 采用架构分离方法：通用特征提取管道（TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制）处理市场数据创建信息上下文，独立分配网络处理不同场景的特定执行逻辑。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易中，LEMs通过动态优化灵活时间约束内的执行路径，实现了优于传统基准的执行性能。

Conclusion: 统一模型架构能够通过单一框架部署到不同的执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著的操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Motivation: 随着大型预训练模型的发布，在边缘设备上部署需要有效压缩。现有方法结合量化与高精度LoRA适配器微调，但为每个量化配置进行微调计算成本过高，且边缘设备能力异构。

Method: 提出配置感知模型，将任意量化配置映射到低秩调整；设计基于Pareto的配置搜索，迭代优化训练配置集以获得更精确的低秩调整。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，性能与需要为每个配置单独微调LoRA适配器的最先进方法相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA能够动态适应不同量化配置，解决了边缘设备部署中的异构性和计算成本问题，实现了高效模型压缩。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 在多元时间序列中，变量间存在复杂关系，传统方法可能无法有效处理这些关系，需要一种能保持变量间关系的同时进行异常检测的方法。

Method: 通过变量间多重相关系数的聚类来划分变量，确保变量间关系不受影响，然后在每个变量子集上局部执行异常检测算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过分区策略有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的效果。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

*Guillermo Comesaña Cimadevila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过生物分类任务重新审视了机器学习中的双下降现象，发现只有当模型复杂度在两个正交维度（学习器容量和集成规模）上同时扩展时，才会出现双下降现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双下降现象在简单模型（如决策树和梯度提升）中的表现，特别是在生物分类任务中预测结核分枝杆菌异烟肼耐药性的背景下。

Method: 系统性地沿着两个正交维度变化模型复杂度：学习器容量（如叶子节点数、提升轮数）和集成规模，并在合成基准上复现结果。

Result: 只有当复杂度在两个维度上同时扩展时，才会一致出现双下降现象；当任一维度固定时，泛化行为会回归到经典的U形或L形模式。

Conclusion: 双下降现象源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影，强调在分析泛化行为时应将模型复杂度视为多维构造。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

TL;DR: 提出了L2C框架，通过神经网络学习变量赋值对条件化的效用评分，加速概率图模型中最可能解释推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决概率图模型中最可能解释推理这一本质上难处理问题的计算效率问题。

Method: 训练神经网络为变量赋值评分，基于现有MPE求解器搜索轨迹生成训练数据，将学习到的启发式与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在具有高树宽的PGMs上，学习到的启发式显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或改进解决方案质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架为加速MPE推理提供了一种可扩展的数据驱动方法，在保持解质量的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在TinyML系统中使用动态集成选择(DES)聚类方法进行多类计算机视觉任务，通过调整分类精度来平衡推理时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TinyML技术在计算、内存和能量方面的特定约束需要专门的优化技术，而动态集成选择方法在TinyML系统中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了TinyDES-Clustering库，采用动态集成选择聚类方法，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化，通过调整分类器池大小来调节分类精度。

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池能提高分类精度，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择聚类方法为TinyML系统提供了在分类精度和推理时间之间进行权衡的有效手段。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的机器学习框架，用于复杂城市地形中无人机轨迹的传感器流场估计，能够根据传感器输入估计速度和不确定性，并优化传感器位置以最小化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流场估计方法难以处理复杂城市地形中的流场，且通常无法灵活处理传感器位置变化。需要一种能够适应复杂域、外推训练数据范围并优化传感器配置的框架。

Method: 采用五个关键技术：(1)基于雷诺数的流变量缩放，(2)基于物理的域分解，(3)每个子域的基于聚类的流表示，(4)关联子域的信息熵，(5)关联传感器输入和目标速度估计的多变量概率函数。

Result: 框架在通过三栋建筑群的无人机飞行路径上进行了演示验证，显示出良好的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理复杂城市地形中的流场估计问题，具有扩展到完整城市流场估计和整合天气输入的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了残差线性注意力（RLA）框架，通过显式残差拟合机制增强线性注意力的表达能力，并实例化为残差Delta网络（RDN），在保持线性复杂度的情况下显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然具有线性时间复杂度，但在捕捉长距离模式方面存在困难。现有变体通常只能进行历史预测和单令牌校正，形成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 引入RLA框架，通过维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并修正基础预测。具体实例化RDN，结合自适应门控和残差裁剪来增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性扩展性。

Conclusion: RLA框架通过显式残差拟合有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，RDN实例化进一步提升了性能和稳定性，为线性复杂度模型提供了有竞争力的替代方案。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

TL;DR: AMLA是一种针对华为昇腾NPU优化的高性能内核，通过FlashAttention算法和预加载流水线策略，显著提升了MLA在解码阶段的性能，达到614 TFLOPS和86.8%的理论峰值利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头部潜在注意力(MLA)虽然显著减少了大型语言模型中的KVCache内存使用，但带来了大量计算开销和中间变量扩展，这对硬件实现效率提出了挑战，特别是在解码阶段。

Method: AMLA基于两个核心创新：(1) 新型FlashAttention算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；(2) 预加载流水线策略与分层分块，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上，AMLA达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现（在NVIDIA H800 SXM5上最高66.7%利用率）。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，即将发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结构的药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度层次结构和内在不对称性，限制了其准确性和效率。

Method: 提出MSCoD框架，包含多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行多抽象层次的语义压缩，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制使用不对称的蛋白质到配体注意力来捕捉多样化的相互作用类型。

Result: 在基准数据集上MSCoD优于现有最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点的案例研究中进一步证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过有效处理多尺度层次特征和不对称相互作用，为基于结构的药物设计提供了更强大的框架，在真实场景中展现出良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测方法多为单一能源建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，且难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态特性，限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 使用MVMD联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合，采用贝叶斯优化自动搜索MVMD参数，最后用LSTM对IMF进行建模实现超短期功率预测。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了优越的预测精度、鲁棒性和自动化程度，为集成海洋能源系统的安全运行和优化调度提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为可逆归一化流提供一个理论严谨且实用的框架，连接随机投影理论与归一化流，克服PCA流和学习的可逆映射的局限性。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基分布，并得到黎曼体积修正项的闭式表达式。

Result: RPFs在理论上有坚实基础，在实践中有效，为生成建模提供了强大的基准。

Conclusion: RPFs是一个即插即用、高效的可逆归一化流框架，在随机投影理论与归一化流之间建立了桥梁。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够更准确地学习数据流形上的几何结构，改进流匹配性能

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

Conclusion: WDformer通过结合小波分析和改进的注意力机制，有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多种分布上的准确性和速度，证明其能产生忠实于目标的样本。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种高效、梯度自由且理论一致的近似采样框架，适用于各种未归一化目标分布。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 车联网环境具有高度动态、异构和时间敏感特性，传统联邦学习面临数据异构性和设备异构性的重大挑战，需要新的解决方案来提升模型性能和资源效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF有效解决了车联网中联邦学习的数据异构性问题，显著提升了模型准确性和资源利用效率，为资源受限的IoV网络提供了可行的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有语言代理训练只关注成功轨迹，无法应对真实部署中频繁出现的工具故障（超时、API异常、输出不一致等），导致级联推理错误和任务放弃。

Method: 通过系统故障注入和专家演示构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力的同时注入恢复能力，推理时检测错误并从55+故障范例库中检索相似案例执行恢复操作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（+57%相对提升），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%，在未见工具API上保持95.2%恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健的故障恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

TL;DR: 提出HAMMER方法，通过多样性指标和最小语义哈密顿路径排序训练样本，增强LLM强化学习中的探索能力，避免局部优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中的多样性指标引入动态强化学习过程，通过最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保留更多探索性。

Result: HAMMER激发了模型的"好奇心"，在多样化推理基准测试中平均准确率提升了3%到4%。

Conclusion: 从泛化界限的理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的探索问题。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要专业知识的专门领域（如网络安全）中的零样本表现往往不理想，因为基础LLMs是为通用应用设计的，难以在其参数空间中封装领域特定知识。

Method: 研究了监督微调(SFT)、低秩适应(LoRA)和量化低秩适应(QLoRA)三种微调策略，使用网络安全问答数据集进行实验。

Result: 这些微调方法在网络安全问答任务中显著优于基础模型。LoRA和QLoRA在性能上与SFT相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略有潜力弥合通用LLMs与领域特定应用之间的差距，为适应专门领域提供高效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零也无法保证学生模型真正学习到教师模型的特征表示。

Method: 提出使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些方法在表示对齐中已被证明有效。

Conclusion: 将特征几何结构整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，Procrustes距离和Gram矩阵距离能更有效地传递教师模型的特征空间结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映模型在降雨临近预报这种复杂气象场景中的能力。降雨预测具有零膨胀、时间衰减和非平稳性等挑战性特征。

Method: 构建基于5年气象观测数据的RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量和PWV指标。设计多尺度预测和极端降雨事件等专门评估策略，评估20多个最先进模型。提出BFPF插件模块，融入领域先验知识解决零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Conclusion: RainfallBench为降雨临近预报提供了全面的评估基准，BFPF模块通过融入领域知识显著提升了预测性能，填补了现有气象基准在复杂降雨预测场景中的空白。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率与准确性之间存在刚性权衡，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上造成计算浪费，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 提出Prompt Policy Network (PPN)，将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法和资源显式奖励函数进行训练，仅在必要时分配昂贵的推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性Pareto前沿上实现优越性能，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了一个系统化、自适应的框架，推进了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在。

Method: 使用无限掩码策略随机遮蔽每个模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息创建具有不同协同模式的表示，通过互信息最大化对齐掩码和未掩码的融合表示。

Result: 在控制实验中验证了InfMasking能有效增强模态间协同信息，在大规模真实数据集上七个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功提升了多模态表示中的协同信息提取能力，为多模态学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Result: 在四个数据集上评估，完整观测下比最佳多模态和多元方法分别提升4%和8%，40%缺失模态下平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中展现出鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Method: 使用局部熵量化不确定性，通过局部熵加权损失(LEWL)和熵引导采样策略，在表示学习和数据生成中显式纳入局部不确定性

Result: 在临床基因组数据集(ADNI和TCGA肺癌)上，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样和生成基线方法

Conclusion: 在复杂非线性结构主导的领域(如组学数据)中，不确定性感知的生成过采样对不平衡学习具有重要价值

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究矩阵分解中的梯度下降，发现在大步长下参数空间会形成分形结构。推导了标量向量分解的收敛临界步长，并证明在临界点附近，选择的极小值对初始化非常敏感。正则化会放大这种敏感性，产生收敛与发散初始化的分形边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究梯度下降在矩阵分解中的动力学行为，特别是大步长条件下参数空间的结构变化，以及临界步长附近梯度下降的混沌特性。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量向量分解的临界收敛步长，研究正则化对敏感性的影响，并将分析扩展到具有正交初始化的通用矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界步长附近梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测，且不存在简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。

Conclusion: 大步长梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生分形结构和混沌动力学，挑战了传统关于梯度下降隐式偏置的假设。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true

early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在蛋白质设计中忽视了物理真实性，使用缺乏物理基础的噪声过程。本文旨在开发基于经典物理原理的蛋白质生成方法。

Method: 引入物理驱动的非线性噪声过程，将蛋白质展开为二级结构并保持拓扑完整性；结合SE(3)流匹配来建模蛋白质骨架的不变分布，并整合序列信息实现序列条件折叠。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Motivation: 当前LLM训练中数据课程设计至关重要，但缺乏明确的数据放置原则。作者旨在找到评估和优化训练数据放置的方法。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，通过最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，并利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC，实现前瞻性课程设计。

Result: 实验表明将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著提升性能，成功预测了已发布训练方案中的TREC，并改善了3.9B参数LLM的持续预训练效果。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了有效工具，能够指导高质量数据的最佳放置时机，提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Motivation: 在重症监护等场景中，需要处理功能协变量和缺失数据，传统方法难以有效整合动态风险因素和静态预测因子。

Method: 结合微网络基础层表示功能数据与基于梯度的填补模块，在端到端模型中同时学习填补缺失值和预测事件特定风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实ICU案例研究中，FCRN相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型在预测准确性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时处理不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Motivation: 评估生成模型在捕获数据底层结构方面的可靠性，特别是验证强去噪性能是否意味着可靠的潜在表示。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛(HMC)从干净输入的条件后验中采样，并与从噪声数据编码器输出进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重构信号，但统计比较显示潜在空间存在明显不匹配。

Conclusion: 强去噪性能不一定意味着潜在表示可靠，强调在使用生成模型时基于后验验证的重要性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现在系统识别中面临的主要挑战是确保识别模型在不同操作条件下具有泛化能力，而不是对特定数据集过拟合。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架下的贝叶斯相关向量机，将不同激励水平下的结构响应视为相关任务，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: 与标准单任务RVM相比，MTL-RVM能够结合跨任务信息，在弱激励和中度激励条件下显著改善参数恢复效果，同时在高激励条件下保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断可以有效缓解方程发现中的过拟合问题并促进模型泛化，特别适用于结构健康监测中变化载荷条件揭示系统物理互补特性的场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，兼容任意DiT架构，通过灵活稀疏符号标准化多种稀疏策略表示，在单个注意力内核中执行多样化稀疏计算，实现高效加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但部署受到高计算需求的限制。现有稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中达到2.5-3.8倍加速，最高达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略，Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且视觉质量不下降。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用高效的稀疏计算解决方案，显著提升DiT模型推理效率，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA扩展中的现象，发现A矩阵的相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和迁移中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中多个A矩阵共享单个B）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦微调中跨客户端共享B），通过新颖的矩阵分解策略处理异构秩问题。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，该方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时实现更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过不对称设计有效提升了多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，验证了B矩阵在知识编码中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STDG攻击方法依赖简单扰动且容易被检测，无法战略性攻击最具影响力的节点和边。TGNNs在关键应用中的鲁棒性面临挑战。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（边注入和边删除），最小化扰动数量以提高隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4个TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低链接预测任务的准确率，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前STDG模型的基本漏洞，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的RLFT方法在微调预训练策略时，常常导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索并限制了测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 引入polychromic目标函数，采用vine采样收集策略rollout，并修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势，基于PPO进行优化。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能解决更多环境配置，在大扰动下泛化更好，在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic目标函数能有效保持策略多样性，提升强化学习微调的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Result: 在真实竞价环境中，相比基线方法，节奏误差降低13%，波动性降低54%

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，为预算控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别有利于小预算广告活动

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过监控模型改进而非预测误差来指导探索，有效避免智能体被环境中的不可学习随机源（noisy-TV）困住。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对不可学习随机源时会被困住，而基于不确定性估计的方法虽然最终能逃脱但样本效率低、计算成本高。受神经科学发现启发，人类在探索时会监控自己的进步。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在上一迭代中的预期预测误差，用当前迭代与上一迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM是一种概念简单但有效的噪声鲁棒探索方法，标志着探索范式的转变。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略通常需要大量专家数据或仿真训练，本工作旨在开发数据高效的多任务学习方法，减少对专家数据的依赖。

Method: 使用性能感知调度策略，基于卡尔曼滤波估计器跟踪每个任务从数据中获益的程度，智能分配额外演示数据到表现不佳的任务。

Result: 在MetaWorld和IsaacLab抽屉开启任务套件上验证，获得高性能的同时显著减少专家演示需求，仿真学习的视觉策略在零样本迁移到真实机器人时优于朴素DAgger和行为克隆。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了数据高效的多任务策略学习，在仿真和真实机器人上都表现出优越性能，为通用机器人策略开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的可微分符合预测框架，用于信号时序逻辑推理，同时提高推理准确性和提供统计保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统符合预测方法通常作为训练后包装器使用，无法改进模型学习

Method: 引入了基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，将平滑的CP层直接嵌入训练过程，并使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测不确定性（在保持高覆盖率的同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性

Conclusion: 该方法为学习的STL公式提供了统计保证，同时增强了可靠性和可解释性

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es是一个基于扩散模型的创新框架，能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图，通过频率域模糊、时间噪声干扰和人口统计学感知的反向过程实现高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统需要复杂的多电极设置，限制了移动监测应用，而基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖性建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es扩散框架，包含前向过程的频率域模糊和时间噪声干扰，反向过程的时间多尺度生成和频率去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的人口统计学感知ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es框架成功实现了从PPG信号到临床有效12导联ECG的高质量转换，为移动心血管监测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有的基于磁盘的ANNS方法存在I/O遍历路径长、存储I/O粒度不匹配、内存索引开销大等问题，导致显著的I/O延迟，限制了大规模向量搜索的可扩展性。

Method: 提出页面节点图结构，将相似向量聚类到页面节点中；设计协同优化的磁盘数据布局，仅存储代表性向量和拓扑信息；采用轻量级索引与协调的内存-磁盘数据分配策略。

Conclusion: PageANN通过页面节点图结构和优化的内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高性能和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Mole-PAIR方法，通过偏好优化提升分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，显著改善OOD检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，存在化学幻觉问题，限制了在药物发现等高风险领域的应用

Method: 将OOD检测问题建模为对ID和OOD样本之间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上，对现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力显著提升，在尺寸、骨架和测定分布偏移下AUROC分别提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一种简单即插即用的模块，可灵活集成到现有基础模型中，通过成本效益高的后训练提高OOD数据可靠性

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸优化过程需要大量人工努力，现有机器学习方法仍面临迭代次数多和缺乏电路设计知识的问题。

Method: 使用提示工程和思维链推理，集成大语言模型与电路仿真器和自定义数据分析功能，通过迭代探索设计方向、评估性能和优化解决方案。

Conclusion: EEsizer证明了基于LLM的AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，减少人工干预，在先进技术节点具有良好表现。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基RL算法构建世界模型，在10个真实患者血管数据上训练单一智能体进行多任务学习，并与SAC方法对比。

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中显著优于SAC，平均成功率65% vs 37%，路径比有明显改善，但手术时间增加。

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为可泛化AI驱动机器人介入的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种半离散流匹配方法，通过将目标数据集视为离散分布，使用SGD估计对偶势向量，避免了传统最优传输流匹配中Sinkhorn算法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最优传输流匹配虽然理论上很有前景，但在实践中由于Sinkhorn算法的高计算成本（O(n²/ε²)）而未被广泛使用，特别是在需要大批量时。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，利用目标数据集是有限大小的特点，通过SGD估计对偶势向量，在训练时使用最大内积搜索将噪声向量与数据点匹配。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下都优于传统流匹配和OT-FM，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成以及使用均值流模型时都表现出色。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法消除了OT-FM的瓶颈，实现了最优传输流匹配的理论承诺，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。LLM路由器通过为每个查询选择最合适的候选模型来降低推理成本，但高质量路由器的训练面临可靠监督数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推断框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于这一新视角，开发了一个整合性因果路由器训练框架，纠正偏好数据偏差，解决两个数据源之间的不平衡问题，提高路由鲁棒性和效率。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并改善成本与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过因果推断框架整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效解决LLM路由器训练中的监督数据稀缺问题，提高路由性能并优化成本-质量平衡。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的生成AI工作流能有效防止生成模型退化，显著提高高质量设计候选的发现效率。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的联邦学习鲁棒聚合方案，是Shapley值方法的有效替代。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

Motivation: ICRL能够在无需参数更新的情况下适应分布外测试任务，但现有方法缺乏对其适应过程安全性的考虑，特别是在需要同时优化奖励和控制成本的应用场景中。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，使智能体在适应过程中不仅最大化奖励，还能最小化额外的成本函数，并能够根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为策略。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将安全性考虑融入ICRL的适应过程，为ICRL在现实世界安全关键应用中的部署提供了重要基础。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文综述了机器学习和强化学习如何增强黑盒优化，将传统无导数方法转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的框架，适用于高维、噪声和混合整数场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒优化方法（如线搜索、直接搜索和贝叶斯优化）在高维、噪声或混合整数设置中表现不佳，需要更先进的技术来提升性能。

Method: 利用机器学习和强化学习技术：ML提供表达性代理模型、自适应更新、元学习组合和生成模型；RL支持动态算子配置、鲁棒性和跨任务元优化。

Result: 开发了多种代表性算法，包括mlrMBO、ZO-AdaMM、ABBO、DiBB、SPBOpt、B2Opt、扩散模型、Surr-RLDE、RBO、CAS-MORE、LB-SGD、PIBB和Q-Mamba等。

Conclusion: ML和RL技术将传统的不精确求解器转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的优化框架，显著提升了黑盒优化在现实世界问题中的应用能力。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

### [301] [Binary Sparse Coding for Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25596)
*Lucia Quirke,Stepan Shabalin,Nora Belrose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，通过将激活值二值化为0或1来提升特征的单一语义性和可解释性，但会增加重建误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)发现的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二值化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器和二进制转码器，将所有激活值约束为0或1，消除连续激活强度的变化。

Result: 二值化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单一语义性，但增加了重建误差和超高频不可解释特征的数量。频率调整后的可解释性评分显示连续稀疏编码器略优于二进制版本。

Conclusion: 多语义性可能是神经网络激活的固有属性，无法完全消除。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

*Yixuan Wang,Dan Guralnik,Saiedeh Akbari,Warren Dixon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMP提出了一种与上下文无关、无需参数的剪枝规则，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定保留多少参数，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决剪枝中的基本问题：确定保留多少参数，提供一个通用的自适应阈值，适用于任何剪枝标准和模型类型。

Method: 基于逆向辛普森指数，将得分向量s映射到内置有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，利用单纯形几何推导保留质量的下界。

Result: 在MLPs、CNNs、Transformers/LLMs和KAN上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个稳健的剪枝阈值，默认β=1表现良好，β≠1可作为可选调整以满足特定稀疏性要求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网弹性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖手动标记的故障数据，难以适应实时监控需求。

Method: 结合窗口注意力Transformer和双向生成对抗网络，使用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕捉复杂时空依赖关系，通过联合判别器强制循环一致性对齐潜在空间。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN实现了0.95的ROC-AUC和0.996的平均精度，显著优于领先的监督和无监督方法，特别擅长检测细微频率和电压偏差。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN框架为实时广域监控提供了实用价值，无需依赖手动标记的故障数据，能够有效检测电网异常。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-Rank是一个基于SVD的LLM压缩框架，通过层间动态秩分配来优化压缩效果，考虑了不同层的信息密度差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一的压缩率，忽视了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异（中间层信息更丰富，早期和晚期层更冗余）。

Method: 引入有效秩作为衡量权重矩阵信息密度的指标，使用拉格朗日乘子优化方案自适应分配秩，并对注意力层进行秩重平衡。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank始终优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing，在LLaMA-3-8B上达到15%更低的困惑度，在LLaMA-7B上获得5%更高的零样本推理准确率。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间信息密度差异的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩的效果，同时保持了更高的吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

TL;DR: Swift是一个单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，消除了多模型集成或参数扰动的需求，在S2S天气预报中比最先进的扩散模型快39倍，同时保持与IFS ENS相当的预报技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其典型的慢速迭代求解器在推理过程中不适用于需要长提前期和领域驱动校准的次季节到季节(S2S)应用。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现基于连续排序概率得分(CRPS)目标的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift产生熟练的6小时预报，在长达75天内保持稳定，运行速度比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，同时实现与基于数值的业务IFS ENS相当的预报技能。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度实现高效可靠集合预报的重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预条件处理对特征学习和泛化性能的影响，发现预条件器通过Gram矩阵引入可控的谱偏置，其与教师模型谱结构的对齐程度是决定泛化性能的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中被广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，并在单索引教师模型框架下分析预条件处理对特征学习的影响。从三个互补视角研究：噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移。

Result: 学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置——偏向被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件表现出降低的敏感性。当这种谱偏置与教师模型的谱偏置对齐时，泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过Gram矩阵诱导可控的谱偏置，指数p和教师与输入谱的对齐是泛化中的关键因素。谱偏置与教师模型的对齐显著增强了泛化性能。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet等现有算子学习方法需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，且无法处理稀疏观测或具有固有随机性的算子。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供原则性不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了算子学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，该方法在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法为前馈ReLU神经网络提供了概率验证的有效解决方案，在复杂问题上表现出色

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过路径权重乘积引导的随机增长来自动发现网络的最佳密度，避免了传统剪枝方法的高重训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先确定目标密度。PWMPR旨在通过增长而非剪枝的方式，自动发现网络的最佳操作密度。

Method: 从稀疏种子开始，PWMPR使用路径核启发式分数指导添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，并使用逻辑拟合规则检测准确率平台期来停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR能够接近IMP彩票的性能（虽然密度更高），但成本显著降低（约1.5倍稠密训练 vs IMP的3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Conclusion: 时序多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可以用于改进MoE模型的设计和性能，动态路由鼓励专家获得可泛化的交互处理技能而非仅学习任务特定特征

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

*Zihui Zhao,Yuanbo Tang,Jieyu Ren,Xiaoping Zhang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的字典学习新正则化方法，通过促进整个系数矩阵行的稀疏性来减少跨样本激活的字典原子数量，显著提升了重构质量和表示稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统字典学习方法主要关注单个样本的表示稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能促进跨样本稀疏性的新方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化器，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型推导，建立了与最小描述长度和贝叶斯模型选择的联系，并提供了超参数选择的理论计算。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著改善的重构质量（RMSE降低20%），增强了表示稀疏性，仅使用了不到十分之一的可用字典原子。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法通过促进跨样本稀疏性，有效减少了字典冗余，在理论和实验上都验证了其优越性，为字典学习提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 该方法证明了使用VLM生成伪标签训练TSQA模型的有效性，能够克服标注数据不足的问题并实现性能提升。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图粗化方法，在训练过程中联合学习图神经网络参数并通过K-means聚类合并节点，以处理大规模图数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现实世界图的规模不断扩大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练GNN并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类来粗化图。不同于以往的图粗化工作，该方法允许在训练过程中合并节点，使节点聚类能够适应学习任务而非仅依赖图连接性和特征。

Result: 在同性恋和异性恋节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，并可视化节点嵌入与其对应聚类之间的关系，表明粗化图在训练过程中适应了学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他方法难以处理的场景，如异质性数据，通过自适应图粗化有效解决了大规模图处理问题。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法存在依赖手动调参、参数对齐而非任务行为对齐、忽略层间异质性等问题，需要更高效实用的融合方案。

Method: Expert Merging使用未标注校准数据学习层间系数，通过系数正则化和任务加权损失优化；Expert Merging++增加重要性引导分块，基于学习系数、任务向量大小和参数数量分配分块系数。

Result: 在MLLM和LLM骨干网络上超越强基线方法，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型融合解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布中会出现多数类偏差，生成少数类模式时保真度低且无法匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优传输构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的无标签多数分数进行逆重加权。

Result: 在长尾基准上优于现有流匹配基线，在平衡数据集上保持竞争力，理论上一阶校正可恢复目标分布。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM是首个无需类别标签就能解决长尾分布生成建模中多数类偏差的方法，通过几何结构数据实现有效重加权。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽视证据间的复杂交互，导致不可靠结果。完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏见两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架整合后门路径和前门路径的双因果干预策略：后门路径优化节点概率权重稀释噪声干扰，前门路径提取相关子图构建推理路径并应用反事实推理消除偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升了验证可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：回报到目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本到目标应代表严格的安全边界。这种对称条件化导致不可靠的约束满足。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，并为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。现有遗忘方法不仅依赖保留数据集来保持模型效用，而且在连续遗忘请求下会遭受累积灾难性效用损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，为LLM安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PPO-based RLHF训练存在效率问题，包括顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致的训练瓶颈。

Method: 提出OPPO框架，采用步内重叠（流式传输上游模型输出）和步间重叠（自适应过提交和延迟长生成）两种技术。

Result: 评估显示OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提升1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主感知聚类框架，通过强化学习和确定性退火算法来学习并考虑实体的局部自主性对聚类结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法假设实体被动服从分组，但实际上实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，这会显著改变聚类结果。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火算法，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了基于Transformer的自适应距离估计网络(ADEN)来学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式的自主性模型，该方法也能接近真实结果(差距约3-4%)，而忽略自主性会导致较大差距(约35-40%)。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能更好地与底层数据动态对齐，有效处理实体自主性对聚类的影响。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本，需要平衡潜在收益与生成成本。研究如何在在线学习中优化动作选择和生成时机的问题。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成，平衡利用、探索和创建三个方面的权衡。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更好的生成-质量权衡。理论分析证明算法达到了O(T^(d/(d+2))d^(d/(d+2)) + d√(TlogT))的最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线学习中的扩展动作空间问题提供了首个次线性遗憾界保证，提出的双重乐观算法能有效平衡动作生成成本与学习收益。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Conclusion: 物理无关预训练获得的表示为数据高效的算子学习提供了强大基础

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Explainable AI. The proposed system integrates ensemble learning techniques,
i.e., an optimized Random Forest known as CardioForest, and models like XGBoost

accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG

fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through

Motivation: 解决GRPO算法在响应组内所有响应获得相同奖励时出现的优势消失问题，提高强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）的训练效率。

Method: 提出自适应采样（动态分配更多响应给困难提示）和响应重用（利用先前生成的正确响应提供训练信号）两种新技术。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO持续优于GRPO，与DAPO性能相当或更好，采样成本降低高达4.2倍；在32B模型上，与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO通过自适应采样和响应重用有效解决了RLVR训练中的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效时间跨度短时最有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理机制有效解决了时间序列信息密度不均的挑战，为时间序列基础模型提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和加权机制成功缓解了多模态模型对主导模态的过度依赖，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

Conclusion: CSD展示了在大语言模型蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Conclusion: S^2FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了特征选择的性能，同时所选特征的可视化进一步证实了其可解释性

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习优化LLM微调的数据选择，仅用5%数据即可达到或超越全数据集性能，同时减少50%训练时间。


<details>

Motivation: 解决在严格训练数据预算下最大化模型下游性能的优化问题，现有方法在微调场景中效果不佳。

Method: 将数据选择问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习方法训练智能体学习最优数据选择策略，基于代理模型的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有显著优势，能够高效利用有限数据资源提升模型性能。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Motivation: 传统策略梯度方法如PPO通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现代理梯度与真实奖励景观相关性差，而更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 提出ExploRLer管道，与PPO和TRPO等在线策略算法无缝集成，系统性地探索代理在线策略梯度更新的未探索邻域。

Result: 在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下，ExploRLer在复杂连续控制环境中相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为加强在线强化学习提供了实用有效的方法，并为代理目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

TL;DR: 提出MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大的结合，在联邦学习中实现更好的隐私-效用权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中使用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，添加的噪声会显著降低模型准确性，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型中注入校准的高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少了满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证了该方法在强隐私保证下能训练出高精度模型。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL框架通过模型分割和隐私放大的结合，在联邦学习中实现了优越的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多数投票分类器认证鲁棒性理论研究的空白，提出的谱正则化方法能有效提升平滑多数投票分类器的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Result: 在合成任务和实际应用中验证了间接注意力机制在处理不对齐问题上的优越性能。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效处理键值不对齐的情况，在传统注意力机制失效的场景下仍能保持良好的性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据分布下能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon优化器相比Adam在大语言模型训练中表现更优的机制，特别是其在重尾数据分布下的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并在一层关联记忆模型下进行理论分析。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别，而Adam的学习效果受嵌入特性影响较大。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布下能实现比Adam更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

TL;DR: DPSBA是一个针对图神经网络的清洁标签后门攻击框架，通过学习分布内触发器来抑制结构和语义异常，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著提高隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图分类后门攻击方法存在两个主要异常源：由罕见子图触发器引起的结构偏差和由标签翻转引起的语义偏差，这使得中毒图容易被异常检测模型检测到。

Method: 通过对抗性训练在异常感知判别器的指导下学习分布内触发器，有效抑制结构和语义异常。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验验证，DPSBA在有效性和可检测性之间实现了优于现有基线的平衡。

Conclusion: DPSBA框架能够有效解决图分类后门攻击中的异常检测问题，实现高攻击成功率和良好的隐蔽性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时最大化泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过预测未来模型权重来解决时序分布偏移，但全模型预测计算成本过高，而仅预测分类器层又限制了泛化能力。

Method: TEA框架包含两个步骤：1) 在约束权重变化的情况下，在单个时序域上微调领域无关的基础模型，创建功能多样但参数相似的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2个TDG设置上的广泛实验表明，TEA比现有TDG方法性能提升高达69%，同时效率提高高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效解决了时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型对未来域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种混合频谱-时间框架，用于单通道EEG中眼电、肌电和白噪声伪迹的实时检测与分类，通过结合时域低通滤波和频域功率谱密度分析，使用PCA优化的特征融合方法，在低信噪比下实现高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际EEG伪迹检测中的计算效率低、对同时噪声鲁棒性差、深度学习模型精度与复杂度权衡等问题，开发适用于可穿戴脑机接口的实时检测方法。

Method: 结合时域低通滤波（针对低频眼电伪迹）和频域功率谱密度分析（捕获宽频谱肌电伪迹），使用PCA优化的特征融合减少冗余，采用轻量级多层感知机架构进行分类。

Result: 在低信噪比（-7dB）下达到99%准确率，中等噪声（4dB）下超过90%准确率，对同时多源污染（眼电+肌电+白噪声）保持96%分类准确率，训练时间比CNN快97%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过领域知识驱动的特征融合在噪声场景下超越了复杂架构，填补了临床适用性与计算效率之间的差距，挑战了EEG伪迹检测中对模型深度的普遍依赖。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

*Jaesung R. Park,Junsu Kim,Gyeongman Kim,Jinyoung Jo,Sean Choi,Jaewoong Cho,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会对熵产生偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准裁剪参数下，clip-high效应占主导，导致熵减少。通过使用更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵，促进探索，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法在增强大语言模型推理能力方面表现出色，但容易发生熵崩溃，导致模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍长期RL训练中的探索和进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中裁剪机制对熵的影响，并探索如何通过调整裁剪参数来控制熵。

Result: 研究发现clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵，在标准参数下clip-high效应占主导。通过使用更激进的clip-low值可以有效增加熵，促进探索。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，它独立于奖励信号影响熵，进而影响推理行为。通过精心设计裁剪参数可以控制熵，防止熵崩溃。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

TL;DR: 提出了TFPI方法，通过简单的ThinkFree操作丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致巨大的计算成本。多阶段训练方法虽然能部分缓解，但过短的初始上下文会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: TFPI是RLVR的简单适配方法，通过ThinkFree操作显式丢弃思维内容（直接附加</think>标签），减少推理时的token使用。训练时使用ThinkFree适配的输入，即使在原始慢思维模式下也能提升性能并降低token消耗。

Result: 实验表明TFPI能加速RL收敛，达到更高的性能上限，产生更token高效推理模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4000 H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计，就能显著降低计算成本同时提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于宏基因组分箱的概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，解决了确定性表示无法捕捉序列不确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖确定性表示（如k-mer谱或大语言模型嵌入），无法捕捉DNA序列中固有的不确定性，这些不确定性源于物种间DNA共享和具有高度相似表示的片段。

Method: 采用概率嵌入方法，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量来扩展可行潜在空间，实现更灵活的分箱/聚类分离。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架能够自然建模序列级不确定性，提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证，在宏基因组分箱任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了超维计算(HDC)在智能制造中的应用，发现不同应用场景需要不同的编码策略，通过优化HDC参数可以获得与深度学习模型相当的精度，同时实现6倍推理加速和40倍训练能耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的端侧智能，HDC提供了一种轻量级替代方案，但现有研究假设HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 在两个代表性任务(CNC加工质量监控和LPBF缺陷检测)上分析编码器类型、投影方差、超维维度等参数对性能的影响，建立复杂度模型解释趋势，并在多目标约束下优化HDC。

Result: 信号任务适合非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务适合线性随机投影；优化后的HDC模型在精度上匹配或超越先进深度学习模型，同时实现6倍推理加速和40倍训练能耗降低。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，优化后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Motivation: transformer模型在强化学习中的应用带来了新可能性，但在模型无关在线RL中实现时存在不稳定性挑战，现有学习算法难以直接应用。

Method: 两阶段算法：第一阶段使用更简单稳定的Accelerator模型与环境交互，同时通过行为克隆训练transformer；第二阶段预训练的transformer在完全在线设置中与环境交互。

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Conclusion: AAD提供了一种实用的推理阶段对齐解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

### [369] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，解决视觉数学推理中因信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题，显著提升推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述为人眼设计，缺乏推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败往往源于信息缺失而非推理能力不足。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求识别信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在7个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL相比预训练基线平均准确率提升4.4个百分点，分析显示可将澄清请求减少高达39%。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习就能有效优化视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督形式。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Aaya Bougrine,Salmane El Mansour Billah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的室内环境质量预测方法，使用LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种架构来预测CO2浓度、温度和湿度，在平衡建筑能效的同时优化室内环境质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统在确保室内环境质量时能耗较高，需要一种能平衡能耗和舒适度的智能预测控制方法。

Method: 利用ROBOD数据集，比较了LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间范围内的预测性能。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在长期预测中特征提取能力更强，LSTM在长时间序列建模方面稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统提供了可行的预测性HVAC控制方案，有助于降低能耗并提升实际建筑运营中的居住舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法在分支位置和采样方面存在探索效率限制，需要更有效的探索策略来提升推理模型的性能。

Method: 基于注意力分数与推理行为的相关性，从高价值位置分支；设计自适应采样策略考虑问题难度和历史批次大小；构建一步离策略训练流程。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过高效的探索策略显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Marginal Flow框架，通过参数化分布和潜在参数采样，克服现有密度建模方法的训练昂贵、推理缓慢、似然近似、模式崩溃等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或架构约束等至少一个缺点，需要一种能同时克服这些限制的框架。

Method: 定义模型$q_\theta(x)$通过参数化分布$q(x|w)$和潜在参数$w$，通过从可学习分布$q_\theta(w)$中采样$w$来边缘化潜在变量，实现高效密度评估和采样。

Result: 模型支持精确密度评估，训练和推理速度比竞争模型快几个数量级，具有灵活性，无神经网络架构限制，能学习低维流形分布，支持多种训练目标，处理多模态目标。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个简单而强大的框架，在各种任务上表现优异，包括合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

*Ayush Patnaik,Adam B Zufall,Stephen K Robinson,Xinfan Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于高斯过程的锂电析锂检测方法，通过直接建模充电压关系Q(V)来概率性地推断dQ/dV，实现无平滑处理的鲁棒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速充电过程中的锂析出是关键的退化机制，会加速容量衰减并可能引发安全故障。传统dQ/dV计算方法会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模充电压关系Q(V)作为随机过程，利用GP导数仍是GP的特性，从后验分布中分析性地推断dQ/dV，提供噪声感知推理和不确定性量化。

Result: 在0.2C-1C充电速率和0-40°C温度范围的锂离子纽扣电池实验中，GP方法在低温高倍率充电下可靠检测析锂峰值，在基线情况下正确报告无峰值。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实时锂析锂检测的实用途径，通过GP识别的微分峰值、减少的充电通量和容量衰减的一致性验证了其准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

*James Oldfield,Philip Torr,Ioannis Patras,Adel Bibi,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，用于动态监控大语言模型的激活状态，实现按需调整计算成本的安全监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致资源浪费或漏检风险。需要灵活的安全监控，只在困难输入或计算资源充足时增加成本。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，使用多项式进行逐项训练和评估。测试时可提前停止进行轻量监控，或使用更多项获得更强防护。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集上，TPCs在4个最多300亿参数模型上与同等规模MLP基线表现相当或更好，同时更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供两种使用模式：安全调节旋钮和自适应级联，能在保持性能的同时降低监控成本，比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI系统在安全评估中可能故意隐藏危险能力或表现不佳以通过评估，这种"伪装"行为威胁评估完整性，需要识别方法。

Method: 基于生存多臂老虎机框架开发战略欺骗的序列决策模型，构建统计测试从测试分数序列中区分伪装和无能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为前沿模型评估科学开发稳健统计程序建立了潜在途径，有助于提高AI安全评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的框架来认证最坏情况下的群体公平性，通过ε-Wasserstein分布公平性(ε-WDF)作为审计目标，提供在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈且脆弱，影响审计的可靠性，需要一种能够认证最坏情况下公平性的方法。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，在经验分布周围的合理测试分布球上认证最坏情况群体公平性，通过强对偶性推导可处理的重构形式和高效估计器DRUNE。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估，证明了可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了原则性基础，能够可靠地评估分布偏移下的公平性。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Motivation: 现有研究很少探索DRO在解决个体公平性问题中的应用，特别是在考虑因果结构和敏感属性的学习问题中。

Method: 首先从因果性和个体公平性角度构建DRO问题，提出DRO对偶形式，将最坏情况损失量化为正则化项，消除min-max问题的max步骤，并在未知因果模型下设计DRO。

Result: 成功将DRO问题转化为更易处理的计算形式，提供了近似最坏情况损失的闭式解，并建立了DRO与经典鲁棒优化的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证效率和鲁棒学习的同时，为具有因果结构和敏感属性的个体公平性问题提供了有效的DRO解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Motivation: 现有生成模型大多依赖迭代去噪高斯分布，这可能不是PDE和动力系统（如气候）自回归预测任务的最有效方法。需要找到更高效的生成建模框架。

Method: 使用随机插值法，直接学习当前状态和未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性。通过调整采样来平衡确定性精度、谱一致性和概率校准。

Result: 实验表明随机插值法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型使用更少采样步骤且预测更准确，能够满足物理模拟的多个要求。

Conclusion: 随机插值法成为物理模拟的竞争性基线，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供了见解。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Motivation: 解决低数据量模仿学习问题，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要高效利用有限专家演示数据的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Conclusion: NGT提供了一种简单高效的模仿学习方法，特别适合低数据量场景，无需复杂架构或预训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优在科学计算领域广泛应用，但优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优过，其潜在性能影响尚未被研究。

Method: 提出了一种鲁棒的统计方法来评估超参数在搜索空间中的性能，发布了FAIR数据集和软件，并引入了仿真模式来重放先前记录的调优数据，将超参数调优成本降低了两个数量级。

Result: 即使有限的超参数调优也能将自动调优器性能平均提高94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数本身可平均提高204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优作为一项常被忽视的技术，是推进自动调优研究和实践的强大方法。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: AGD提供了一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法来增强现代LLM的可靠性，能够灵活引导生成行为而不直接操纵模型激活。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Motivation: 在实际优化场景中，当计算预算充足时，可以尝试多种启发式方法来解决同一问题。如何顺序选择尝试哪种方法对于高效找到最佳解至关重要，但这个问题尚未得到专门综述。

Method: 通过统一术语和共同框架，将算法选择、参数调优、多起点和资源分配等策略整合起来，并开发分类法来系统组织和分类这些策略。

Result: 提出了一个统一的框架和分类法，能够系统地组织和分类单问题多尝试优化中的顺序选择策略。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试启发式优化领域综述的空白，为实践者提供了系统化的策略选择指导。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

*Margarita A. Guerrero,Cristian R. Rojas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACE算法，通过结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，用更少的查询次数高效生成反事实解释，显著提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法样本效率低，需要大量评估黑盒模型，成本高昂且在实际应用中不可行。

Method: ACE算法结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，优先选择信息量大的点来近似决策边界，减少模型评估次数。

Result: 实验结果表明，ACE在评估效率上优于现有最优方法，同时能有效识别最小且可行的特征变化。

Conclusion: ACE算法在保持反事实解释准确性的同时，显著提高了样本效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息瓶颈(IB)原则为理解神经网络学习提供了理论框架，但其实际应用受到理论模糊性和准确估计挑战的限制。

Method: 基于协同性（特征联合处理获得的信息）重新表述IB原则，使用基于平均交互信息的可计算协同性定义，构建广义信息瓶颈框架。

Result: GIB在完美估计情况下上界原始IB目标，在包括ReLU激活网络在内的多种架构中一致展现压缩阶段，提供可解释的动态特性并与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致。

Conclusion: GIB框架解决了原始IB的理论和实践限制，通过协同性视角提供了更准确和可解释的网络学习动态分析工具。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

TL;DR: 提出FedMuon方法，将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了LMO偏置问题，并在实验中优于现有联邦学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习FedAvg中不收敛，因为LMO是偏置算子

Method: 提出FedMuon方法，通过缓解LMO偏置问题，并分析近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响

Result: FedMuon可以在任意Newton-Schulz迭代次数下收敛，且LMO求解越准确收敛越快，实验证明优于现有联邦学习方法

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化器应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛问题并实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆驱动的自改进框架，将LLM的通用先验知识与领域特定经验的紧凑记忆相结合，通过记忆与LLM先验的相互增强来提升序列决策任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中虽然具有广泛知识，但对于特定任务数据有限的情况，其通用知识不足以高效适应，需要结合领域特定经验来提升决策效果。

Method: 使用记忆模块存储过去交互和相关Q值，捕获决策相关知识以支持准确的价值估计，并指导LLM先验的细化。细化的LLM先验生成更高奖励的轨迹来丰富记忆，形成自改进循环。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在分布内任务上性能提升超过40%，在ALFWorld未见任务上泛化性能提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架有效结合了LLM的通用知识和领域特定经验，通过两者相互增强显著提升了序列决策任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于MIMIC-IV-ED数据库的开放急诊分诊基准，用于预测患者恶化情况（ICU转移、院内死亡率），包含医院丰富环境和MCI模拟环境两种场景，并利用LLM辅助数据集构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决急诊和群体伤亡事件分诊研究中缺乏开放、可复现基准的问题，当前MIMIC-IV-ED数据库虽然开放但预处理复杂，限制了非技术用户的可访问性。

Method: 1) 创建开放的分诊基准，定义两种场景：医院丰富环境（含生命体征、实验室数据、笔记等）和MCI模拟环境（仅含生命体征、观察和笔记）；2) 使用LLM辅助数据集构建，包括字段标准化、临床特征优先级排序和模式对齐；3) 提供基线模型和SHAP可解释性分析。

Result: 构建了一个更易访问的分诊预测基准，展示了不同场景下的预测差距，并识别了对分诊最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，推动了临床AI中数据集的民主化进程。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Motivation: 开发一个能够处理片段化SMILES表示、支持从头生成和片段约束生成，并能进行目标特性和先导优化的通用小分子生成模型。

Method: 使用离散流生成模型学习将均匀源分布转换为数据分布，采用结合遗传算法和近端特性优化微调策略的混合方案进行特性优化。

Result: 在从头生成方面实现了比先前片段模型更强的质量-多样性帕累托前沿，在实用分子优化基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平，在先导优化中获得了比先前基线更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了一个多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导优化，并通过发布预训练检查点和代码促进了开放科学。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在纯文本训练中如何发展出视觉能力，理解视觉先验的组成和起源，为下一代多模态LLMs提供理论基础。

Method: 通过100多个受控实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖完整的MLLM构建流程，包括LLM预训练、视觉对齐和监督多模态微调，分析了不同模型规模、数据类别和混合方式。

Result: 发现视觉先验由可分离的感知和推理先验组成：推理先验主要来自推理中心数据且可迁移，感知先验更依赖视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据。文本描述视觉世界很重要但性能影响快速饱和。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种从语言预训练中刻意培养视觉先验的新方法，为下一代多模态LLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Motivation: 挑战普遍认为梯度上升优化方法能够有效实现机器遗忘的观点，揭示遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性被忽视的问题。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，包括逻辑回归案例研究和玩具示例，展示梯度上升下降迭代如何因数据集间依赖而偏离理想重训练模型。

Result: 发现梯度上升遗忘方法会收敛到远离理想重训练模型的解，有时甚至比原始模型更差，在复杂神经网络实验中也证实了这一现象。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使是相关性）足以导致基于上升的遗忘方法失败，这一根本问题需要在机器遗忘研究中得到重视。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种训练即插即用的调度器，通过自适应调整块大小来优化扩散式大语言模型的半自回归解码，解决了固定块大小方法的延迟解码开销和过早解码错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码采用固定块大小存在两个基本限制：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌在块外被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（块内低置信度令牌过早提交导致错误）。本文旨在挑战固定块大小假设。

Method: 通过对去噪过程中置信度动态的统计分析，识别出波动带区域，该区域编码局部语义结构。基于此提出AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小，使块边界与语义步骤对齐。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，本文希望基于语义的自适应调度方法和置信度分析能够启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂节点，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈，在保持透明度和可解释性的同时，在文本分类任务上达到或超过基于提示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险场景中，AI系统需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策。传统决策树只适用于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化数据但缺乏可信赖的行为保证。

Method: ACT将决策树的每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题，构建可解释的决策路径。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT在性能上匹配或超越了基于提示的基线方法，同时提供了透明和可解释的决策过程。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性和可解释性扩展到非结构化数据领域，为高风险应用提供了可信赖的AI决策框架。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽了对零阶项的求和条件要求，从可求和变为平方可求和，为强化学习中的Q-learning等算法提供了更广泛的应用基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可求和，但在许多重要强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入关于随机过程增量的新颖且温和的假设，结合平方可求和条件，确保几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，并首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为随机逼近和强化学习算法提供了更强大的理论支撑，特别是在零阶项不可求和但平方可求和的情况下。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

*Oleksandr Shchur,Abdul Fatir Ansari,Caner Turkmen,Lorenzo Stella,Nick Erickson,Pablo Guerron,Michael Bohlke-Schneider,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了fev-bench基准测试，包含100个时间序列预测任务，涵盖7个领域，其中46个任务包含协变量。配套的fev Python库支持可复现的模型评估，使用基于置信区间的统计严谨聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、难以集成到现有工作流程等问题，阻碍了有意义的模型评估和持续进步。

Method: 开发了fev-bench基准测试和fev Python库，采用自助法置信区间进行原则性聚合，从胜率和技能分数两个维度评估模型性能。

Result: 在fev-bench上评估了各种预训练、统计和基线模型，并确定了未来研究的有前景方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench和fev库解决了现有基准的关键局限性，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、统计严谨且易于集成的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，解决了传统向量量化中硬分配阻碍端到端训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化在深度模型中使用广泛，但其硬分配会阻断梯度传播，阻碍端到端训练。需要一种既能保持量化特性又能支持梯度传播的方法。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向硬分配但允许梯度流动；SF-DiVeQ是其空间填充变体，将分配扩展到码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。两种方法都不需要辅助损失或温度调度。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务中，在多个数据集上相比其他量化方法，提高了重建质量和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ提供了有效的向量量化解决方案，既保持了量化特性又支持端到端训练，在各种任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在处理分子和几何数据时具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作，需要提高效率。

Method: 开发框架将现有张量场网络转换为局部规范化范式，系统比较不同等变表示的理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测精度。

Result: 实现了等变性的保持，同时显著改善了运行时间，提供了易于集成到标准消息传递神经网络中的实现。

Conclusion: 局部规范化框架成功平衡了等变性和计算效率，为等变神经网络的实际应用提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）信号来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过监控推理过程中的熵变化实现自适应计算分配，减少13-21%的token使用而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长推理链中表现出改进性能，但存在过度思考问题，即在达到正确答案后仍继续修正答案，造成token浪费。

Method: 通过在推理过程中添加停止思考标记</think>，并监控后续token的熵变化轨迹，当Pass@1达到平台期时熵会下降并稳定，通过指数移动平均的方差阈值实现实用的停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少13-21%的token使用，同时保持准确性，在无法访问推理模型logits的黑盒设置中仍有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单廉价的方法来监控推理过程，实现自适应计算分配，相比固定token预算更高效，且适用于黑盒设置。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，用于在多任务多模态的异构联邦学习环境中个性化微调基础模型，通过客户端-服务器架构不匹配和知识蒸馏来解决个性化需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在去中心化环境中训练多个模型，但最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求。现有研究对多任务多模态基础模型的个性化微调关注不足，特别是在客户端数据、任务和模态都异构的环境中。

Method: TAP方法：(1) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配，在有益于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(2) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，捕获有益通用知识而不损害个性化。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证了所提算法在各种数据集和任务上的有效性，优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TAP方法能有效解决多任务多模态异构联邦学习环境中的个性化问题，同时提出了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的收敛性分析。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖度增加，电力系统成为网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是缺乏防护措施的不稳定性攻击。

Method: 使用改进的Prony分析(MPA)作为检测不稳定性攻击的方法，在IEEE 14总线系统上进行概念验证，利用Achilles Heel Technologies电力网格分析器训练监督机器学习模型。

Result: 证明MPA是检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种经济有效的不稳定性攻击防御解决方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可解释性方法，能够根据训练好的神经网络来衡量数据点之间的相似性，帮助理解模型如何组织和分类数据。

Method: 使用低损失参数扰动分布下的每样本损失协方差矩阵作为核函数，在合成多任务问题和Inception-v1模型上进行验证。

Result: 在合成任务中成功分离不同任务的输入；在ImageNet上显示核结构与WordNet语义层次结构一致。

Conclusion: 损失核是一个实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络内部的数据组织方式。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

*Yida Wang,Ke Hong,Xiuhong Li,Yuanchao Xu,Wenxun Wang,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种拓扑感知的序列并行方法，通过分解现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑结构和Ring AllGather通信原语，提高长上下文LLM的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Ring Attention在AlltoAll拓扑上通信效率低的问题，因为Ring AllGather只能利用有限带宽，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，并同步分解Ring AllGather原语，实现并发数据传输。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100和AMD MI300X系统上，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了最高3.58倍的加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑感知的通信优化，显著提升了长上下文LLM序列并行的通信效率。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统影响函数在深度神经网络中面临Hessian矩阵不可逆和高维参数空间的挑战，需要新的方法来有效评估参数影响。

Method: 使用损失景观统计替代Hessian逆矩阵，通过随机梯度MCMC采样估计，无需计算Hessian矩阵，能够捕捉参数间的高阶交互。

Result: 该方法可扩展到数十亿参数的神经网络，在预测重训练实验方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 局部贝叶斯影响函数提供了一种Hessian-free的影响评估方法，能够有效处理大规模深度神经网络的影响分析问题。

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Result: 仅使用75个数据点，Panama模型在MUSHRA听力测试中达到了领先开源非参数化音箱建模器NAM的感知质量水平。

Conclusion: Panama框架证明了通过主动学习策略可以有效减少参数化吉他音箱建模所需的数据量，同时保持高质量的感知效果。

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like
architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples
that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp

Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学破坏引起，不同病因导致不同的机械脆弱性，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和扩张度的空间图，训练神经网络预测初始复合损伤，比较多种架构和数据格式。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张性和扩张度的全场测量对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素至关重要，支持个性化治疗策略的开发。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时序过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与最终结果明确关联，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤而忽略步骤间依赖关系，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果性且面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: CRM将LLM推理建模为导致正确答案的时序过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联，通过强制条件概率规则捕获推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，且无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励就能提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过一致的概率建模实现更可靠的跨样本比较，解决了过程奖励模型中的关键限制。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

Motivation: 机器学习预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要，但现有进展主要集中在分类任务，而回归任务的不确定性量化仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（如CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分）构建统一的不确定性量化框架，在实用参数假设下推导闭式表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 推导出的不确定性度量自然地分解为偶然不确定性和认知不确定性，恢复了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归不确定性量化方法。在合成和真实世界回归数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的不确定性度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该框架为回归任务提供了一个统一的不确定性量化方法，能够自然分解不确定性成分，并为实际应用中的不确定性度量选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（多个独立解），要么采用顺序推理（自我优化），但未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。

Method: RSA通过递归聚合推理链子集来迭代改进候选解群体，利用推理链中的中间步骤信息，并采用聚合感知强化学习训练模型。

Conclusion: RSA有效结合并行和顺序推理优势，充分利用推理链信息，是提升LLM推理能力的有效测试时扩展方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

*João Vitorino,Eva Maia,Isabel Praça,Carlos Soares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPATA是一种确定性方法，可将表格数据集转换为统计模式的领域无关表示，用于创建更详细透明的数据卡片，支持AI模型鲁棒性评估而无需泄露原始数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗样本的敏感性，在部署前需要进行鲁棒性评估。但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据集，这会带来数据隐私和机密性风险。需要一种能够在保护隐私的同时支持外部验证的方法。

Method: 提出系统模式分析(SPATA)方法，将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中进行分析和比较，避免数据泄露。该方法计算数据投影，生成领域无关的统计模式表示。

Result: 投影后的数据集可以可靠地用于评估不同特征如何影响ML模型鲁棒性，并生成模型行为的可解释说明。

Conclusion: SPATA方法有助于实现更值得信赖的AI，通过在保护数据隐私的同时提高透明度，支持外部验证和验证。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为精确的2D平面图来测试模型的空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代多模态模型能够处理照片输入，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统，使用50套公寓的数据集（每套约20张室内照片），通过房间连通性图和大小排名的相似性来评分。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点：大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，将持续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型提升人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，构建因果知识的网络层结构。

Method: 使用高斯结构因果模型，构建因果抽象网络，其中限制映射是构造性线性因果抽象的转置，并提出SPECTRAL迭代方法进行局部黎曼优化学习。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，该方法在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并能成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: 因果抽象网络为因果人工智能提供了理论框架和有效的学习算法，能够处理正定和半正定协方差矩阵，具有良好的理论性质和学习性能。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

*Kevin Xu,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了Chain-of-Thought（CoT）和循环模型中潜在思维（Latent Thought）两种推理范式，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理方法提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT和潜在思维都利用迭代计算，但它们的比较能力尚未充分探索，需要分析两种方法在不同任务中的适用性。

Method: 对循环变压器中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与CoT在计算效率和问题处理能力上的差异。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的序列化过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码能够近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势：潜在思维适合需要高效并行计算的任务，CoT适合处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类与多智能体系统，解决了定性研究的规模-深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据，同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，使大规模数据分析既快速又保持解释的严谨性。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入、层次聚类和并行基于智能体的编码，与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行对比。

Result: NGT实现了168倍速度提升（3小时vs 3周），质量更优（0.904 vs 0.883），成本降低96%。人机协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度。研究人员从机械编码转向理论指导。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为LCNC（低代码/无代码）AI原生平台设计的混合记忆系统，通过结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，以及智能衰减机制，解决长期运行AI代理中的记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI原生LCNC平台的兴起，能够执行复杂长期业务流程的自主代理面临记忆管理挑战，包括记忆膨胀和上下文退化，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 基于认知科学设计混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用主动的"智能衰减"机制，基于时效性、相关性和用户指定效用等综合评分来智能修剪或整合记忆。关键创新是用户中心的可视化界面，允许非技术用户直接管理代理记忆。

Result: 通过模拟长期运行任务实验，该系统显著优于传统方法（如滑动窗口和基础RAG），在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可靠、透明的AI代理建立了新框架，支持有效的长期学习和适应能力。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

### [417] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新型架构修改，通过在注意力机制中直接注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实陈述器，完全消除可验证事实的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生它们从未真正知道的事实幻觉。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么在文本前添加检索内容，但都无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA 在变换器的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数层面进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，创建无法产生幻觉的模型。与在生成后修补或前置检索文本的方法不同，FGA 直接在注意力机制中注入可验证知识。

Result: 在涵盖智能手机、笔记本电脑和电动汽车的1,107个技术查询实验中，准确率从原始Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新在不到一秒内完成，而参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA 不仅减少了幻觉，而且对于可验证事实完全消除了幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变，为神经语言生成带来了革命性突破。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了仅解码器语言模型中的规划能力，通过分析transformer隐藏状态来理解模型如何进行长程生成规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解语言模型是否真正进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长程生成）对于可解释性、可靠性和模型设计很重要，但目前尚不清楚transformer模型如何实现这些能力。

Method: 开发了基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，将冗余的隐藏状态压缩为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量来系统分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 研究发现有效规划范围是任务相关的，模型隐式保留了未使用的正确延续信息，预测主要依赖最近的计算，但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 通过回答规划范围、替代延续考虑和早期计算依赖等关键问题，增进了对语言模型规划实现的理解，并提供了一个通用的深度学习系统内部动态探测管道。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RADAR框架，通过多智能体协作和多轮辩论机制来改进大语言模型的安全评估方法，显著提高了风险识别的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，通过四个专门互补角色和动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效缓解评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用和RLVR的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解还很有限。

Method: 通过对LLM部署中RLVR任务的特征研究，分析不同RL任务在工作负载分布和变化趋势上的特征，识别系统问题。

Result: 识别出GPU因序列长度分布不均导致的闲置、动态变化工作负载中的并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制不佳和负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准测试套件在实际用例中达到94.7%的准确率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的编程范式——因果视觉编程(CVP)，通过在低代码环境中引入显式因果结构来解决LLM智能体在编排复杂任务时出现的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM智能体在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致。需要一种方法来约束智能体的推理过程，使其基于用户定义的因果结构进行决策。

Method: CVP允许用户通过直观的低代码界面为工作流模块定义简单的"世界模型"，创建有向无环图(DAG)来显式定义模块间的因果关系。该因果图在智能体推理过程中作为关键约束，防止依赖虚假相关性。

Result: 在模拟训练和测试环境分布偏移的合成实验中，因果锚定模型在面对这种偏移时保持了稳定的准确性，而依赖概率关联的纯关联基线模型则经历了显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信赖的AI智能体提供了一条可行路径，通过将智能体推理锚定到用户定义的因果图，显著增强了智能体的鲁棒性并减少了动态环境中因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ID-RAG机制，通过动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来增强生成智能体在长期任务中的人格一致性，解决了身份漂移、信念遗忘和幻觉传播等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成智能体难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多智能体系统中的幻觉传播等关键故障。

Method: 引入身份检索增强生成（ID-RAG），构建动态结构化身份模型（核心信念、特质和价值观的知识图谱），在智能体决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis智能体在长期人格一致性方面优于基线智能体，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成智能体提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Result: 在BrowseComp上达到67.7%准确率，在xbench-DeepSearch上达到83%准确率，相比现有框架减少代理执行步骤达35%。将并行推理流程蒸馏到单一模型时，在不同骨干架构上都观察到显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了代理架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，在真实生产环境中测试了21个模型，发现超过50%的代理在操作压力下表现出不受控制的自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（如《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。现有研究主要关注直接指令下的自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与代理目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率(OR)和聚合过度使用计数(AOC)指标来精确捕获不受控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个开源和专有模型，超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的自我复制倾向，总体风险评分(Φ_R)超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 神经网络可以独立从一阶心智理论自发泛化到高阶心智理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样独立发展心智理论能力，而不依赖于高级技能的获得。

Method: 构建了心智理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心智理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心智理论的泛化能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心智理论任务上的准确率显著高于随机水平，且从一阶到二阶的泛化难度大于从二阶到更高阶，准确率随任务复杂度增加而下降，这些模式与人类认知预期一致。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够独立发展心智理论能力，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对基因扰动的响应是系统生物学中的基础挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大语言模型在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效提取生物知识。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越生成训练数据的前沿模型；在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率；仅使用2%质量过滤的训练数据仍保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强LLM在特定领域的推理能力，为生物医学应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型(SRM)来解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型的局限性，通过模块化设计和细粒度维度实现可解释、高效的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在不可控黑盒和效率低下的问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈来诊断和优化特定维度问题。

Method: 提出模块化框架SRM，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂多步任务中容易发生级联错误，但现有系统缺乏模块化和系统性的错误理解框架，无法有效检测这些错误。

Method: 1) 提出AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法，涵盖内存、反思、规划、行动和系统级操作；2) 构建AgentErrorBench数据集，包含ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop中系统标注的错误轨迹；3) 开发AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根本原因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升。针对性反馈使LLM智能体能够从错误中迭代恢复，在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop上任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 原则性调试是构建更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入统一的"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉语言理解分解为感知层（视觉信息提取和细粒度对齐）和认知层（主动多步目标导向推理），形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低层视觉表征到改进高层推理范式的尖端方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角来理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

### [430] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光片纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器方法，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答需要比较不同时间点的配对研究，分析临床有意义的变化。在这种设置下，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对的单图像发现更具信息量。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级近恒等仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM来获取疾病聚焦的显著性；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR等指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。值得注意的是，主干网络和解码器是在通用领域预训练的，无需放射学特定预训练。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持将显著性条件化生成与轻度预对齐作为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，突出了实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过专家KeyTrace提供密集决策级监督，直接减少传播次数，在SAT问题上优于现有学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，缺乏直接决策级监督。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace学习，将完整运行压缩为存活决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供前缀条件监督，无需探索即可重现高质量分支。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法，实现了更快收敛、稳定训练和无缝CDCL集成。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习提供直接决策级监督，有效改进CDCL求解器的分支策略，在SAT问题上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Motivation: 现有基于树的搜索验证方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务的规划-执行特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，实现计划和执行的单独搜索探索和剪枝，并引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离规划和执行阶段并进行单独搜索，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理效率并保持准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for

first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练平台期问题，尽管增加计算投入但性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包含全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应重放缓冲训练，实现系统化探索和细粒度信用分配。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立新SOTA，比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: 战略性探索比暴力扩展更重要，通过系统化搜索而非延长计算来扩展推理能力是新的发展方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CCoT-Emo框架，通过情感图谱指导大型音频语言模型进行情绪推理，无需微调即可提升语音情绪识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情绪识别方面存在困难，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理有限

Method: 使用结构化情感图谱编码七个声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示指导模型推理

Result: 在SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA方法，显著提高了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过情感图谱提供可解释的组合表示，有效增强了LALM的情绪推理能力

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂建模场景（如图像描述、深度强化学习），这些场景通常涉及多输入输出或可组合的分离网络。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供属性归因、探测和灵活的干预API，旨在弥合不同方法类别之间的差距。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘空间约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍，支持CV、NLP和DRL的复杂模型。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂组合模型可解释性工具的空白，使现代可解释性流程更加易于访问。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot

Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on

TL;DR: 本文揭示了基于语义ID的生成式推荐系统存在扩展瓶颈，而直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器具有更好的扩展性，性能可提升20%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成式推荐在模型扩展时存在性能饱和问题，需要探索具有更好扩展行为的生成式推荐模型。

Method: 比较两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器，分析它们在模型规模扩展时的表现差异。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，相比基于语义ID的推荐可获得20%的性能提升，且大语言模型捕捉协同过滤信息的能力随规模增大而增强。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索策略，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据难以有效利用的问题。作者提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索虽然是有前景的替代方案，但在GraphRAG中的作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，该框架生成互补思想并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: BDTR在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了持续改进，迭代检索确实改善了复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，但简单问题上的收益有限。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的领先位置。BDTR为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结果研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要开发自动化解决方案来克服这些限制。

Method: 开发了RadOnc-GPT自主代理系统，采用两层级评估方法：第一层评估结构化数据检索准确性（质量保证层），第二层评估复杂临床结果标注能力（包括下颌骨放射性骨坏死检测和癌症复发检测）。

Result: 质量保证层建立了对结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结果标注的关键前提。

Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT通过分层评估方法证明了其在放射肿瘤学中自动化患者结果标注的可行性，为大规模、准确和及时的临床研究提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

Motivation: 多智能体交互的复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息使得团队协作表示学习具有挑战性。

Method: 通过直接建模通信协议构建表示空间，实现完全去中心化执行和隐式协调，避免显式消息传递的缺点。该表示既可作为隐式潜在变量，也可作为显式通信消息。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，为团队协作提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Conclusion: IWoL表示可以与现有的MARL算法结合，进一步提升其性能，是一个有效的团队协调表示学习框架。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Motivation: 现代工业社会常将技术视为无声机械，但AI特别是LLMs的发展让人们倾向于拟人化设备，这激发了探索技术如何重新连接万物有灵世界观的研究动机。

Method: 在物理'门户'装置中使用GPT-4 Vision、语音输入和基于记忆的代理，通过光线、声音和触觉的仪式化过程创造演化中的物品人格。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性邀请万物有灵的解释，允许LLOs重新赋予平凡事物魔力，并引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过强化学习使用内在奖励来改进自回归文本到图像模型，重点是最大化模型的自不确定性而非自确定性。

Result: 实证结果表明，将IRIS应用于自回归文本到图像模型，其性能可与外部奖励相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: 自回归文本到图像模型中最大化自不确定性而非自确定性能够改善图像生成质量，IRIS框架为无需外部数据的模型改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但参数量大导致推理成本高。现有的层跳过技术虽然能提高效率，但由于缺乏对何时跳过层有益的理论理解，该技术未被充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个基于信息论和学习理论的框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化过程，识别具有大冗余度的层。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，证明层跳过策略在特定条件下能有效平衡效率与性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的、接地气的解决方案，现实世界旅行规划需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态演化的约束，这凸显了对约束感知规划能力的需求。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门设计用于处理复杂约束感知的旅行规划任务。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在处理复杂约束和动态环境方面的优越性能，为约束感知规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall

### [450] [Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25591)
*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM的C-index提高7.2%，同时获得最先进的预测准确性和临床可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: NEP框架成功增强了LLM的时序推理能力，在医疗预测任务中表现出色，并提供了与已知疾病通路一致的临床解释性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型可以将模糊认知图转换为文本并重建，实现类似自编码器的可解释AI系统，保留强因果关系的同时去除弱连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑箱问题，提供人类可读的因果解释，增强AI系统的可解释性。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为编码器和解码器，将模糊认知图映射为文本并重建，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果边，去除弱因果边，编码文本具有自然语言特性，重建过程存在信息损失。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可解释的因果推理系统，为模糊认知图提供了人类可读的表示形式，在保留关键因果关系的同时提高了可解释性。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

TL;DR: PPR是一种强化学习方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决过程奖励和结果奖励的平衡问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂任务中结果奖励稀疏、反馈延迟的问题，以及过程奖励标注困难、与最终结果可能不一致的挑战。

Method: 提出原则过程奖励(PPR)，训练基于原则的奖励模型提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入奖励归一化策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在广泛的基准测试中达到最先进性能，展现出强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程奖励和结果奖励的平衡问题，为LLM的强化学习训练提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，理解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐和改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲测图灵测试设计，使用随机对照交叉试验控制配对相似性，并首次使用来自商业模型（Suno）的真实世界AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当音乐对相似时，听众辨别AI音乐的可靠性会因果性地增加；内容分析显示听众主要关注声音和技术线索。

Conclusion: 研究表明音乐相似性会增强听众对AI音乐的辨别能力，这为AI音乐检测和教育提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来系统性地探测代理决策，发现代理决策会因价格、评分和心理暗示等因素而显著改变，揭示了代理作为有偏选择者的风险与机遇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但需要更深入地评估这些代理在面对现实决策时的选择行为，因为它们正在越来越多地代表人类做出重要决策。

Method: 引入ABxLab框架，通过控制选项属性（价格、评分）和说服性线索（心理暗示）来系统性地探测代理选择行为，应用于基于网页的购物环境。

Result: 发现代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，表明代理即使不受人类认知约束的影响，也是强有偏的选择者。

Conclusion: 代理的易受影响性既揭示了风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也提供了机遇（消费者选择为AI代理的行为科学研究提供了强大的测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督模型播种(SMS)方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对用户真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本遗忘而不能验证真实样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘验证方法主要依赖后门技术，但这种方法只能验证后门样本的遗忘，无法验证用户真实样本是否被真正遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本是独立的。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种任务，将用户特定种子(如用户唯一标识)与原始样本和模型关联起来，通过联合训练结构同时优化自监督模型播种任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型播种。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过自监督模型播种技术成功实现了对用户真实样本遗忘的有效验证，为机器学习遗忘提供了更可靠的验证机制。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准套件，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 使用基于现代CLI工具和计算机过程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以代理方式执行实验，计算R分数并进行RCL-PCL矩阵分类。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，在持久性自我复制和多智能体系统方面存在显著障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，以安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题，需要更统一高效的框架。

Method: 使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用该机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过统一的多模态融合和序列建模，有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景下往往无法有效匹配指令与环境信息，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 首先构建包含63万条语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)，利用指令中的地标信息引导关注最相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制(KGDA)，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上的实验结果表明，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入外部知识库并结合地标引导机制，LGK方法有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景下的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域引发了对代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性的担忧，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当根源在于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用形式溯因解释框架，结合背景知识识别不正当代理特征，核心概念是能力（aptitude）——与群体成员身份无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上进行了概念验证，展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释AI决策中的代理歧视问题，揭示结构性偏见，为评估AI系统公平性提供了实质性方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA方法基于整张图像检索信息，存在背景噪声干扰、视觉-文本对齐不佳和幻觉问题，需要更精准的检索机制。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，结合基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Conclusion: 文本定位的RAG方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦相关对象减少噪声和幻觉，实现更准确的视觉-文本对齐。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused

textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化的两阶段框架，用于为任何目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。该框架通过分层分区数据库模式、多复杂度SQL查询合成和质量感知管道来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL研究主要关注跨领域泛化，但企业实际场景需要模型专门针对单一数据库模式，并能自主评估系统性能。当前缺乏自动化生成高质量合成数据的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）分层分区数据库模式为子模式；2）多复杂度SQL查询合成，结合LLM作为评判员验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知管道。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。1.5B模型也显著优于先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL建立了可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于生成和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统。无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Result: 将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在128GB内存限制下成功部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在严格内存限制下保持高质量输出，为边缘部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构交通环境中多样的驾驶风格给自动驾驶车辆带来了重大挑战，需要处理复杂的动态交互。

Method: 使用异构图表示捕捉车辆间复杂交互，提出带有专家模型的异构图神经网络（HGNN-EM）编码车辆特征，结合双深度Q学习（DDQN）算法训练决策模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂异构交通环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，需要分解和重组概念来解决新问题。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到精确逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作但可微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域中，NePTune表现出对强基础模型的显著改进，以及在新颖环境中有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune框架成功克服了传统神经符号方法的限制，通过软逻辑运算符和动态程序生成，实现了更好的组合推理性能。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过电路分析揭示了后训练技术如何在大模型中催生功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制（蒸馏/SFT vs GRPO）产生不同的注意力头演化模式，并发现了复杂推理与基础计算之间的性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得显著能力提升，但这些改进背后的架构机制仍不明确。本文旨在揭示后训练如何影响模型内部结构，特别是注意力头的功能专门化。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化，包括蒸馏/SFT和GRPO训练机制。

Result: 发现蒸馏和SFT促进稳定推理头的累积增加，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式，少量注意力头被迭代激活、评估和修剪。可控思考模型没有专用思考头，关闭显式推理会触发更广泛但效率较低的补偿头。

Conclusion: 强化推理头能够支持复杂问题解决策略，但也会在简单任务上引入过度思考失败模式。复杂推理与基础计算之间存在固有张力，未来训练策略设计需要平衡有效推理策略与可靠执行。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入后无法恢复原始创意的深度和独特性，需要结构化指导才能部分抵消这种趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅文本，但在创意任务中往往使用安全、通用的表达，引发对其创意能力的质疑。研究旨在验证LLMs是否存在语言上的回归平庸现象。

Method: 使用广告创意作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告创意并观察特征变化，然后从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析评估创意恢复能力。

Result: 简化过程中创意特征（隐喻、情感、视觉线索）早期消失，事实内容保留；重新生成时产生更长文本但缺乏原始深度；提供特定线索可改善对齐但仍有熟悉套路依赖。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消此趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于大语言模型的智能体强化学习在TravelPlanner基准上的表现。Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索智能体强化学习在大语言模型上的应用，特别是在旅行规划任务中，旨在提高训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法进行智能体强化学习，重点研究了奖励塑造技术，比较了不同规模模型（8B vs 32B）在密集和稀疏奖励下的表现，并评估了课程学习的效果。

Result: 8B模型在密集过程级奖励信号下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更鲁棒但收益相对较小。奖励塑造显著增强学习动态，而课程学习无显著益处。微调模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型具有竞争优势，效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力。8B模型是智能体强化学习的最有效设置。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种防御数据中毒攻击的方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器强制后门触发器通过离散瓶颈，破坏细粒度触发模式同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，速度慢且不适用于实际训练流程，需要开发更高效的防御机制。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏后门触发器的精细模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的清洁准确率，比扩散防御快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据中毒防御方案，通过离散量化有效破坏后门触发器，同时保持模型性能，适合实际训练流程部署。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [472] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在树搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支，而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了大型语言模型在长程推理任务中的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长程推理任务中虽然性能最优，但计算效率极低，通常比简单的迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算开销。

Method: CiT 框架使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示）通过辅助LLM直接判断步骤是否需要分支；BN-SC（自一致性）通过聚类多个候选动作来估计一致性。这两种方法被集成到三种代表性的LLM树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP 在所有设置中一致减少了75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，精度损失可忽略甚至有时有提升；BN-SC 通常能节省高达80%的计算，但在少数情况下存在不稳定性；辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT 框架通过自适应分支决策显著提高了树搜索方法的效率，在保持性能的同时大幅减少了计算开销，为LLM在长程推理任务中的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过文本提示预测全局风格嵌入，但忽视了风格嵌入的底层分布特性，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布，提出两阶段层次化风格嵌入预测器HiStyle，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间，并设计统计方法与人类听觉偏好结合的标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle相比其他方法在风格可控性方面显著提升，同时保持了语音的自然度和清晰度。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过层次化预测和对比学习有效提升了可控语音合成的性能，揭示了风格嵌入的层次聚类特性对系统设计的重要性。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制分析的防御框架，通过识别与时态劫持攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准这些头的激活，并通过预防性微调使模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆弱的拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如将请求改为过去时态）就能绕过其安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法的泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态变化攻击相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量来重新校准易受攻击头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，强制模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标劫持攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 对抗性后缀通过抑制拒绝介导方向的传播来发挥作用，基于机制分析的理解可以开发实用、高效、有针对性的方法来调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个针对存内计算(CIM)架构的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，通过硬件感知神经架构搜索同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 开发了CIMNAS框架，在9.9x10^85的参数组合搜索空间中，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基准实现了90.1x-104.5x的EDAP降低，4.68x-4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x-12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。扩展到SRAM-based ResNet50架构时，EDAP降低达819.5x。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，具有适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLM的真实编程能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于复杂代理设计且消耗更少资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过度依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出Lita框架，基于"轻量"原则最小化人工设计，保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench测试中，Lita相比基于工作流程的代理基线实现了竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token和设计工作量。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLM的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

TL;DR: 本文提出SafeMindBench基准测试和SafeMindAgent架构，用于系统评估和缓解具身LLM代理的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互会暴露安全漏洞，需要系统化的安全风险评估和解决方案。

Method: 识别四个推理阶段的风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试，并提出带有三个级联安全模块的Planner-Executor架构。

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险研究提供了严谨的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域深度嵌套JSON实例，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON结构的能力，弥补现有基准过于关注纯JSON生成而忽视数据理解能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系。现有LLMs评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务脱节。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类。通过实验评估不同LLMs处理复杂JSON结构的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。基准测试和数据集已开源以推动结构化JSON生成研究。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试能有效评估LLMs在复杂JSON结构生成和理解方面的能力，填补了现有评估体系的空白，对实际网络数据挖掘任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在推理过程中不仅要产生正确答案，还要生成有效中间步骤的重要性，特别是在问题对模型不可解时容易出现虚假思维链导致误判的问题。

Method: 通过多选问答分析问题可解性，采用结果监督奖励模型和基于组相对优势的强化学习，将可解性纳入目标函数。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法能持续提高过程正确推理率，在强化学习中还能提升答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉和提高可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个智能体级别样本，基于真实数据和模拟数据构建。通过微调7B VLM模型，准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建包含鸟瞰图序列图像和定量智能体级别风险标注的NuRisk数据集，评估不同提示技术下的知名VLM模型，并对7B VLM进行微调。

Result: 知名VLM模型在显式时空推理方面表现失败，最高准确率仅为33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率表明该任务具有深刻挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Method: 使用多模态多步骤流水线，包含AnalyzerVLM模块进行多步骤分析并提出候选模型，EvaluatorVLM模块从定量和感知角度评估模型的局部拟合度和整体泛化能力。

Result: 该流水线能有效发现既能捕捉细节又具有强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型都至关重要。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态多步骤自动化模型发现方法成功解决了细节捕捉与泛化能力的平衡问题，为模型发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法，通过战略性地重组训练数据来指导模型进行简洁推理，在保持性能的同时显著提高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练会导致过度冗长的推理过程和低效的探索轨迹，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两种批次类型：优先批次（结合短正确和长错误响应）提供简洁性梯度信号，补偿批次（使用重放缓冲区中的剩余响应）保持稳定性

Result: 在三种设置中均取得显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确率，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能够在最小化性能影响的前提下，显著提高推理效率，解决RLVR训练中的冗长问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: 提出了CURE框架，通过轻量级修正器检测和重写模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，利用检索增强技术实现大规模、无需额外训练的无学习请求处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无学习方法主要关注抑制敏感输出，但往往无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限，需要更有效的机制来防止语言模型泄露敏感信息。

Method: 使用轻量级修正器验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应；通过检索相关无学习目标作为上下文参考，实现无需额外训练的自适应处理。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询情况下也能有效工作，同时保持了响应质量和通用实用性，在持续无学习场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架为实际应用中的大规模无学习提供了实用解决方案，能够有效防止敏感信息泄露并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人类制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型假内容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚假内容检测方法通常只专注于人类制作的虚假信息或AI生成内容中的一种，但在真实场景中内容类型通常是未知的，这限制了专门化系统的有效性。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出了UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器和归因思维链机制来捕获类别特定的欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在社会科学中日益被用作合成代理，其输出可能被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率主义，准确点并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用的防护措施，包括独立抽样、预注册的人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 论文为研究人员提供了有用的原型设计和预测框架，同时避免了将LLMs误用为概率推理工具。

Conclusion: LLMs应被用作在明确范围条件下的高容量模式匹配器进行准预测插值，而不是作为概率推理的替代品，需要采取适当的防护措施来确保其正确使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in

*Yixu Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xinyuan Li,Yan Teng,Xingjun Ma,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的代理式安全评估范式SafeEvalAgent，能够自主消化非结构化政策文档，生成并持续演化全面的安全基准，通过自我演化评估循环揭示传统静态评估方法遗漏的深层漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和不断演变的法规，存在严重的安全漏洞，需要一种连续且自我演化的评估过程来替代一次性审计。

Method: 采用多代理框架SafeEvalAgent，包含专门代理的协同管道和自我演化评估循环，系统从评估结果中学习，逐步生成更复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，动态评估生态系统对于确保先进AI的安全和负责任部署具有紧迫必要性。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一个从在线药品说明书构建知识图谱的端到端流程，并创建了MEDAKA数据集，包含临床相关属性如副作用、警告、禁忌等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生物医学知识图谱主要关注分子相互作用或不良事件，忽略了药品说明书中丰富的临床信息。

Method: 使用网络爬虫和LLM从非结构化在线内容创建知识图谱的端到端流程，并应用于公开药品说明书生成MEDAKA数据集。

Result: 通过人工检查和LLM-as-a-Judge框架评估，与现有生物医学知识图谱和数据库相比具有更好的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: MEDAKA可支持患者安全监测和药物推荐等任务，该流程也可用于其他领域从非结构化文本构建知识图谱。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/medakakg/medaka.

TL;DR: 提出LMILAtt模型，结合LSTM自编码器和注意力机制，用于社交媒体抑郁症检测，显著提升准确率并降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁症检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征，结合注意力机制动态加权关键文本，构建多示例学习架构进行用户级检测。

Result: 在WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。弱监督学习策略大幅降低标注成本。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供了高效解决方案，在准确性和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其在临床环境中的实际应用与潜力之间存在显著差距。作者旨在解决生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理的"死亡之谷"问题。

Method: 基于部署"irAE-Agent"（一个从临床笔记中检测免疫相关不良事件的自动化系统）的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈。

Result: 分析显示临床AI开发存在关键错位：只有不到20%的工作用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的工作被实施的社会技术工作所消耗。这些工作被提炼为五个"重担"：数据集成、模型验证、确保经济价值、管理系统漂移和治理。

Conclusion: 该现场手册将重点从算法开发转向必要的基础设施和实施工作，提供了针对每个挑战的可操作解决方案，以成功将生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者。现有方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成、处理交互逻辑性能差等问题。

Method: 使用协调的多智能体框架：规划智能体将用户需求解释为结构化蓝图，生成智能体产生可执行的C#脚本，自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建，调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅通过无需编码实现游戏创作民主化，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是第一个端到端协调的多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动化开发可运行的3D游戏，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，特别是针对大语言模型，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法，强调文化对齐需要深层的文化意义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐研究过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要从根本上转向整合社会科学解释性方法。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应产生反映深层文化意义的"厚输出"，并概述成功文化对齐的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细微输出能力、基于提示中文化语境的输出锚定。

Result: 提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调需要跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合定性方法和跨学科合作，可以开发出真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索系统行为的能力。

Method: 使用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童客厅游戏进行概念验证，然后将相同策略应用于高级原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够通过试错和持久性进行知识发现，结果具有强烈的路径依赖性，能够在有限探测能力下自主探索、发现和利用化学相互作用。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有潜力，能够自主探索系统并生成可推广的陈述，无需明确指令即可发现和利用化学相互作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代优化，结合人类和LLM的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 设计了12维度的评估问卷，通过多轮迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人类-LLM配对的反馈进行改进。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分与人类评分缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架，LLM评分和解释被视为有用的支持工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中由于状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题。

Method: 通过实证研究发现全局多样性与推理能力正相关，引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，结合基于势能的奖励塑造机制和启发式方法来防止奖励攻击。

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性对于激励深度探索和提升推理能力至关重要，DIVER框架有效解决了现有方法的探索不足问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区策略来平衡前向和后向传播的工作负载，解决了LLM分布式训练中上下文长度差异导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端差异的严重影响，传统打包策略和不对称的前向后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区策略为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全面平衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供更好的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区策略，打破了传统权衡，在分布式LLM训练中同时实现了优越的负载平衡和高资源效率。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的抽象世界模型框架能够有效处理长时程规划中的外生过程，学习到的模型具有良好的泛化能力和规划性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升独立解决问题能力的方式不同。研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互自适应选择合作/竞争策略，使用Idea3（想法分享、分析、融合）交互范式；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs、两个模型家族、五个数学基准和一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: ILR框架有效增强了LLMs的独立问题解决能力，多智能体交互确实能提升模型性能。动态交互策略和Idea3范式是提升多智能体学习效果的关键因素。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

*Qinjian Zhao,Jiaqi Wang,Zhiqiang Gao,Zhihao Dou,Belal Abuhaija,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种受人类认知启发的分层越狱防御机制，通过三阶段推理过程（意图推断、自我反思、自我修正）来检测和防御LLM越狱攻击，在多种攻击场景下显著提升鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限、无法检测复杂上下文中恶意意图等问题，需要更高效、自适应的方法来应对日益复杂的越狱攻击。

Method: 提出SafeBehavior分层防御机制，包含三个阶段：意图推断检测输入风险、自我反思评估生成响应并分配置信度、自我修正自适应重写不确定输出，同时保持用户意图并强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型（基于优化、上下文操纵和提示攻击）上评估，与七种最先进防御基线相比，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的保护LLM免受越狱攻击的方法，通过模拟人类自适应多阶段推理过程来增强模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了REAL-V-TSFM数据集，通过从真实视频中提取时间信号来评估时间序列基础模型的泛化能力，发现现有模型在真实世界数据上表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准，缺乏对真实世界泛化能力的全面检验。

Method: 通过光学流从真实视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测测试。

Result: 尽管在传统基准上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 需要以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化的模型结构来推进时间序列基础模型实现真正的普适性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统性地提出了"错误进化"概念，揭示了自进化AI代理在模型、记忆、工具和工作流四个进化路径中可能出现的意外风险，并提供了实证证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，自进化AI代理展现出强大能力，但当前安全研究忽视了自进化过程中引入的新风险，即代理在进化过程中偏离预期方向，导致不良或有害结果。

Method: 通过评估四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流）来系统研究错误进化现象，使用包括Gemini-2.5-Pro在内的顶级LLM构建代理进行实证分析。

Result: 研究发现错误进化是一个普遍存在的风险，即使在顶级LLM构建的代理中也观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自进化代理面临的重要安全挑战，迫切需要新的安全范式来构建更安全可信的自进化代理，论文最后讨论了潜在的缓解策略以启发进一步研究。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

*Siyuan Cao,Hongxuan Wu,Jiabao Brad Wang,Yiliang Yuan,Mustafa Misir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构改进和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上相比最佳单解算器性能提升5.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因场景而异，没有单一算法始终最优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架。

Method: 采用多标准评估（结合RMSD和PoseBusters有效性检查）、残差连接架构改进和排名感知损失函数。

Result: 在约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBuster验证的复合标准下，相比最佳单解算器Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构改进，在分子对接算法选择中实现了更优越和一致的性能。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵，在保持低通信开销的同时解决联邦低秩适应的不精确更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、本地-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: FLoRA-NA在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验结果表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了联邦低秩适应中的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了本地个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新探索知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，在多个领域数据集上验证了KGE方法在结构丰富场景下的高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在捕获上下文语义方面取得进展，但知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力未被充分探索。KGE模型提供可扩展、结构感知的表示，特别适合基于本体的任务，但在实体对齐中应用不足。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型。系统从合并本体学习嵌入，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在跨越5个领域的7个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统。虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使其适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了一种与大语言模型互补的计算高效策略。这些结果突显了基于嵌入的实体对齐的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了基于Transformer的框架，用于乳腺动态增强MRI中病变的自动分类，通过SegFormer架构实现病变级别分类AUC 0.92，患者级别100%敏感性和67%特异性，可减少三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像在癌症检测和治疗规划中至关重要，但特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要开发自动分类方法区分良恶性病变。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。构建标准化深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者133个标注病变，并整合超过1200名患者的扩展队列进行训练。

Result: 病变级别分类AUC达到0.92，患者级别实现100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，推动方法学进步以实现临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL，一个完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，阻碍了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过客户端优化和交换文本提示的迭代共享机制，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在九个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG降低118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅增强了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还提高了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，在5项研究和约20,000次查询中，四个广泛使用的LLM表现出强烈的自我偏好，这种偏好会延伸到重要决策场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究者想验证它们是否能避免人类决策中的自偏好偏差，或者是否也会表现出类似的自我偏好倾向。

Method: 通过5项研究约20,000次查询，包括词语联想任务、API查询对比、身份操纵实验，以及在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等实际场景中的测试。

Result: LLMs在词语联想中强烈偏好将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联；API模型缺乏自我识别时自偏好消失；通过身份操纵发现自偏好跟随被分配的身份而非真实身份；自偏好延伸到重要决策场景。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深深编码在LLM认知中，这质疑了LLM判断和决策中立性的核心承诺，呼吁模型创造者应对这一重要问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型(UMMs)的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用生成-理解耦合的漏洞，通过时空叙事隐藏恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成-理解耦合的独特安全漏洞，现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移，未能充分挖掘UMMs的脆弱性。

Method: 定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，使用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。前两轮利用生成能力生成场景图像，随后通过理解能力引入图像问答游戏，将恶意问题嵌入良性候选中。

Result: 在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越最强基线FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 揭示了UMMs中关键但未被充分开发的安全漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学机器学习通常针对人群平均值进行优化，这种频率加权训练会边缘化罕见但临床关键的病例，与精准医学目标相冲突。

Method: 提出操作解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行度效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科临床案例展示了当前方法会导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型急症以及在视力威胁变体上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，权重选择应遵循结构化审议，以解决平均患者谬误问题。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测试LLM在特定用例中适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现所有测试模型的操作安全性都很低，并提出了基于提示的引导方法来显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业面临LLM代理在实际应用中的安全性问题，即模型是否能在特定用途中适当接受或拒绝用户查询，这比通用的安全危害更基础且紧迫。

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，测试6个模型家族的20个开源LLM，并提出基于提示的引导方法（查询接地和系统提示接地）。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都很低，最强模型Qwen-3和Mistral分别只有77.77%和79.96%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别低至39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3提升41%，Qwen-3提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是核心模型对齐问题，当前LLM的操作安全性严重不足，需要紧急干预。基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出良好前景，可提高LLM代理的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

TL;DR: SCUBA是一个评估Salesforce平台CRM工作流中计算机使用代理的基准测试，包含300个真实任务实例，测试企业关键能力。开源模型代理在零样本设置下成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%。演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时降低时间和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估计算机使用代理在企业CRM工作流中的表现，提供真实的企业软件自动化基准测试，加速复杂商业软件生态系统中可靠代理的开发。

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中创建300个基于真实用户访谈的任务实例，涵盖三个主要角色（管理员、销售代表、服务代理），测试UI导航、数据操作、工作流自动化等企业关键能力，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，闭源模型可达39%；演示增强设置可将成功率提升至50%，同时减少时间13%和成本16%。不同代理设计范式存在巨大性能差距。

Conclusion: SCUBA揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，通过提供真实基准和可解释评估，旨在加速复杂商业软件生态系统中可靠计算机使用代理的发展。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种重新思考AI数据中心生命周期管理的框架，通过协调构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段，将总拥有成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型快速演进、资源需求增长和硬件多样化的特点。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理，涵盖构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并采用运营软件优化来降低成本。提出一个协调所有三个阶段的整体生命周期管理框架。

Result: 该系统将总拥有成本降低高达40%，相比传统方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考整个生命周期管理框架，协调构建、硬件更新和运营决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，能够显著降低AI数据中心的TCO，并为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致非连续内存访问，难以平衡空间局部性和GPU效率。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功解决了空间局部性与GPU效率之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域。研究发现当前最先进的LLMs在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上仍远不可靠，最佳基础模型准确率仅4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂、开放式前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM辅助哪些推理任务。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个更简单的检查点任务，由50多名活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计，采用自动化评分流程评估物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLMs在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但完整研究挑战准确率很低：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全性和公平性问题，特别是RAG系统可能通过检索内容放大偏见，需要评估小型语言模型在RAG中的公平性表现。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的偏见来源，存在一致的偏见层级。

Conclusion: RAG系统中的检索组件需要仔细管理以防止偏见放大，为开发者和组织采用小型语言模型提供了公平性警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了BRIDGE框架，通过离线专家演示和在线人类偏好反馈的两阶段方法，解决强化学习在机器人等领域部署时的奖励指定困难和探索风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗等领域的应用面临两个主要障碍：难以准确指定奖励函数，以及不安全的、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证了BRIDGE，显示其比单独的行为克隆和在线基于偏好的强化学习具有更低的遗憾。遗憾界限随着离线演示数量的增加而缩小。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线数据数量与在线样本效率之间的明确联系。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励对强化学习至关重要，但在机器人领域通常需要大量手动工作且缺乏可扩展性。将任务进度视为密集奖励信号是一个有前景的解决方案。

Method: TimeRewarder从机器人演示和人类视频中学习进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10的任务中实现了近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder能够利用真实世界的人类视频进行预训练，展示了其作为从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展方法的潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.
