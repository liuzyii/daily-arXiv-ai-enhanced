### [2] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter是一种从自由稀疏图像进行快速表面重建的新方法，通过端到端密集高斯初始化、相机参数估计和几何增强场景优化，解决了传统方法在稀疏视图下重建效果差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法需要密集校准视图，而从自由稀疏图像重建往往因有限重叠和过拟合导致表面质量差。

Method: 使用大型Transformer编码多视图图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成密集几何一致的高斯场景初始化，采用贡献度修剪消除局部漂浮物，在快速优化中利用深度和多视图特征监督来缓解过拟合。

Result: FSFSplatter在广泛使用的DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从稀疏自由图像实现高质量表面重建，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [3] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Oracle-RLAIF框架，用通用Oracle排序器替代训练奖励模型，结合新的基于排序的损失函数GRPO_rank，在视频理解任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频语言模型参数规模扩大，收集人类反馈成本高昂。现有RLAIF框架依赖专门的奖励模型，训练成本高且限制性强。

Method: Oracle-RLAIF框架使用通用Oracle排序器对候选模型响应进行排序而非评分，结合基于GRPO的GRPO_rank排序损失函数直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 实验证明Oracle-RLAIF在各种视频理解基准测试中持续优于使用现有微调方法的领先视频语言模型。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为基于排序而非评分的强化学习对齐大型多模态视频模型提供了灵活且数据高效的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [4] [ROGR: Relightable 3D Objects using Generative Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03163)
*Jiapeng Tang,Matthew Lavine,Dor Verbin,Stephan J. Garbin,Matthias Nießner,Ricardo Martin Brualla,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Philipp Henzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROGR是一种新颖的可重光照3D重建方法，通过生成式重光照模型从多视角图像中重建物体的可重光照3D模型，能够在任意环境光照下高效地进行前向重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可重光照3D重建方法通常需要对每种光照条件进行优化或复杂的光传输模拟，缺乏高效的前向重光照能力。

Method: 使用生成式重光照模型采样物体在多种光照环境下的外观，训练光照条件神经辐射场（NeRF），采用双分支架构分别编码一般光照效果和镜面反射。

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上评估，在大多数指标上优于现有最先进方法，并在真实物体捕捉上展示了良好效果。

Conclusion: ROGR方法实现了无需逐光照优化或光传输模拟的高效前向重光照，在可重光照3D重建任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [5] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一的视觉到动作学习策略，成功实现了物理合理且视觉对齐的运动重建，克服了两阶段设计的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [6] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了人机协作在面部识别中的效果，提出了近端准确率规则(PAR)，发现当人类与机器的基线准确率差异较小时，协作能最大程度提升系统准确率。通过智能人机融合策略，可以超越单独机器或全部人机组合的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人机协作面部识别系统的准确率提升条件，探索如何有效结合人类和机器的优势来改善决策质量。

Method: 使用专家和非专家面部识别者的数据，分析人-人和人-机协作效果，提出近端准确率规则(PAR)来预测协作收益，并实施智能人机融合策略。

Result: 协作收益随协作者间基线准确率差异减小而增加；发现了一个关键融合区域，即使人类准确率低于机器，融合后仍能提升系统准确率；智能融合策略比单独机器或全部人机组合更准确。

Conclusion: 人机协作在面部识别中具有重要价值，智能融合策略能有效提升系统准确率并降低低性能人类的影响，为AI在面部识别中的智能应用提供了循证路线图。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [7] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于视频生成模型不确定性量化的框架S-QUBED，包含评估指标、黑盒UQ方法和基准数据集，能有效分解预测不确定性为偶然性和认知性成分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型像大语言模型一样会产生幻觉，生成看似合理但事实错误的视频。目前缺乏视频模型的不确定性量化方法，存在严重的安全隐患。

Method: 提出了S-QUBED框架：基于稳健秩相关估计的校准评估指标；利用潜在建模将预测不确定性分解为偶然性和认知性成分的黑盒UQ方法；用于基准测试的UQ数据集。通过在潜在空间中调节生成任务，分离任务规范模糊和知识缺乏导致的不确定性。

Result: 在基准视频数据集上的实验表明，S-QUBED能计算与任务准确度负相关的校准总不确定性估计，并有效计算偶然性和认知性成分。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对视频生成模型不确定性量化的研究工作，提出的S-QUBED框架能有效量化视频模型的不确定性，为视频生成系统的安全应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [8] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO)方法，通过优化文本嵌入来提升预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成图像的美学质量，无需额外训练且与骨干网络无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对预训练文本到图像扩散模型在简单提示词下生成图像美学质量不足的问题，希望通过优化文本嵌入来改善生成效果。

Method: 使用三重目标函数优化文本嵌入：提升生成图像的美学保真度、确保与优化后文本嵌入的一致性、通过提示词保留项最小化与初始提示词的差异。

Result: 定量和定性评估证实了该方法的有效性，在性能上超过或等同于最先进的文本到图像和提示词适应方法。

Conclusion: PEO是一种无需训练、骨干网络无关的有效方法，能够显著提升预训练扩散模型在简单提示词下的图像美学质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型无标记多相机系统，用于在真实野外环境中捕捉精确的3D手部和物体数据，解决了现有数据集环境多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要在受控实验室环境中采集，限制了环境多样性和模型泛化能力，需要开发能够在真实野外条件下进行精确3D手部跟踪的方法。

Method: 设计轻量级背载式捕捉装置，结合8个外中心相机和Meta Quest 3头显的2个内中心视图，构建了内-外中心跟踪流水线来生成准确的3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 收集了包含同步多视角图像和精确3D手部姿态的标注数据集，显著降低了环境真实性与3D标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在真实野外条件下实现精确的3D手部和物体跟踪，为无约束环境中的手部交互研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [10] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频蒸馏方法，将多步扩散模型蒸馏为少步学生模型，通过输入人体姿态条件引导注意力和损失函数，实现实时性能并提升视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法由于大量去噪步骤和昂贵的注意力机制导致速度缓慢，无法实现实时部署。

Method: 利用输入人体姿态关键点之间的准确对应关系来引导注意力到相关区域（如说话者的面部、手部和上半身），提出输入感知稀疏注意力和输入感知蒸馏损失。

Result: 实现了实时性能，并在视觉质量上优于最近的音频驱动和输入驱动方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合输入感知稀疏注意力和蒸馏损失，该方法在保持高质量的同时实现了实时视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [11] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FunLoRA方法，通过基于低秩适应的新型条件机制解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需在当前任务数据上训练即可避免遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的持续适应具有巨大潜力，但增量训练面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。现有方法依赖合成数据进行再训练，存在训练时间不断增加和长期性能下降的问题。

Method: 设计基于LoRA的新型条件机制FunLoRA，专门使用秩1矩阵，通过精心选择的函数增加重参数化矩阵的秩，实现动态条件调节。

Result: 基于流匹配模型的实验显示，FunLoRA在分类准确率上超越基于扩散模型的先前最优结果，同时仅需部分内存成本和采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，能有效解决生成模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双视场、序列保持的鲁棒性框架，用于美国交通灯和标志识别，通过统一的三层防御堆栈提高对数字和自然退化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆中的交通灯和标志识别错误直接影响导航和安全。现有研究缺乏对时间连续性、多静态视场感知以及数字和自然退化鲁棒性的考虑。

Method: 基于多源数据集构建双视场序列保持框架，采用特征压缩、防御性蒸馏和基于熵的异常检测组成的三层防御堆栈，结合序列时间投票进行增强。

Result: 统一防御堆栈达到79.8mAP，将攻击成功率降低至18.2%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer，同时将高风险误分类减少到32%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了交通灯和标志识别系统对对抗性攻击和自然退化的鲁棒性，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [13] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO是首个优化流匹配模型中强化学习噪声扰动的方法，通过迭代搜索策略改进噪声分布，提升奖励优化和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型的确定性特性使其不适合强化学习，而现有通过随机噪声扰动引入随机性的方法效率低且不稳定。

Method: 采用迭代搜索策略：解码候选扰动、用奖励函数评估、向高奖励区域优化噪声分布。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

### [14] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC是一个统一的多模态运动生成框架，通过整合意图建模和视觉先验，显著提升了运动合成的质量和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动运动生成方法存在局限性：无法捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑和人类意图，缺乏视觉基础限制了生成精度和个性化。

Method: 提出MoGIC框架，联合优化多模态条件运动生成和意图预测；引入混合注意力机制实现条件标记与运动子序列的局部对齐；构建440小时基准数据集Mo440H。

Result: 在HumanML3D和Mo440H数据集上分别降低FID 38.6%和34.6%；在运动描述任务中超越基于LLM的方法；支持意图预测和视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC推进了可控运动合成和意图理解，展现了多模态生成能力，为运动生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于运动自适应的3D重建框架，通过语义和运动先验优化控制点分配，在动态区域集中控制点，减少静态背景冗余，并使用样条轨迹参数化实现更平滑的运动表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法仅基于几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余和动态区域不足，无法有效处理运动复杂度的不匹配问题。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型的语义和运动先验建立patch-token-node对应关系，应用运动自适应压缩，通过迭代体素化和运动趋势评分实现表示密度自适应，使用基于样条的轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面相比现有最先进方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的运动自适应框架有效解决了控制点分配与运动复杂度不匹配的问题，实现了更高质量的动态3D重建。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Net2Net是一种结合无监督DIP和监督预训练DRUNet的混合去噪方法，通过RED正则化实现，无需标记数据即可适应各种真实噪声模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统去噪方法依赖手工先验，难以处理真实噪声的复杂性；深度学习方法需要大量标记数据且泛化能力有限。需要一种能结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 结合无监督DIP网络和预训练DRUNet网络，通过RED正则化实现混合框架，无监督网络适应输入图像的独特噪声特征，预训练网络利用大规模数据集的学习表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在真实世界噪声去除方面具有优越性能，特别是在训练数据有限的情况下表现更好。

Conclusion: Net2Net通过结合无监督和监督网络的混合框架，有效提升了去噪方法的泛化能力和性能，特别适用于真实噪声场景。

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提高检索准确性，解决了DeepSeek-R1方法直接应用于检索任务时的计算成本高和训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepSeek-R1展示了RL增强LLM推理能力的潜力，但直接应用于检索任务存在计算成本高（多候选推理消耗大量token）和训练不稳定、结果次优的问题。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块和细节检查机制减少token数量但保留关键信息；提出新训练范式：使用检索定制合成CoT数据集进行激活阶段优化，然后采用课程奖励的RL训练。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准测试和任务中实现了SOTA性能、高效率和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Retrv-R1通过信息压缩和新训练范式成功解决了RL在检索任务中的应用挑战，为多模态通用检索提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

TL;DR: BCA+是一个无需训练、基于贝叶斯推理的统一测试时适应框架，用于视觉语言模型的目标识别和检测任务。它通过动态缓存机制自适应更新类别嵌入、空间尺度和类别先验，结合不确定性指导的融合策略，在推理过程中同时修正模型的语义理解和上下文置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法要么依赖计算昂贵的反向传播，要么只关注似然适应而忽略了先验的重要性。为了解决这些问题并扩展到目标检测任务，需要在保持高效性的同时实现更全面的适应机制。

Method: BCA+采用动态缓存机制存储和更新类别嵌入、空间尺度和自适应类别先验。将适应问题建模为贝叶斯推理，通过融合初始VLM输出和基于缓存的预测来生成最终预测，其中缓存预测结合了动态更新的似然（测量特征和尺度相似性）和先验（反映演化类别分布）。

Result: 大量实验表明，BCA+在识别和检测基准测试中都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: BCA+提供了一个高效、无需训练的统一测试时适应框架，通过贝叶斯推理和动态缓存机制，在目标识别和检测任务中实现了显著的性能提升，同时保持了实时部署的可行性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种层次化广义类别发现方法（HGCD-BT），用于脑肿瘤分类，能够识别训练时未见过的肿瘤类别，在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法准确率提升28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑肿瘤分类方法局限于预定义类别，无法识别训练时未见的肿瘤类型。无监督学习缺乏利用标注数据先验知识的能力，而半监督方法假设所有潜在类别都在标注数据中。

Method: 将层次化聚类与对比学习相结合，在基于对比学习的GCD方法基础上引入半监督层次化聚类损失函数。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上，HGCD-BT在斑块级别分类中比最先进的GCD方法准确率提升28%，特别是在识别未见肿瘤类别方面表现优异。在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas的整张切片级别分类中也验证了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT方法能够有效识别已知和未知的脑肿瘤类别，在不同成像模态中都具有良好的通用性，为神经肿瘤手术中的术中决策提供了更准确的分类工具。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练的关键帧采样模块，通过统一的相关性-多样性最大体积目标，为长视频理解选择信息丰富且非冗余的关键帧，并在弱对齐情况下自动切换到仅多样性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型依赖均匀采样，往往忽略关键时刻；而现有关键帧选择方法要么采用刚性时间间隔错过细粒度线索，要么强调视觉多样性但忽视查询相关性。

Method: 提出RD-MV目标，结合查询条件相关性评分和对数行列式多样性组件；使用轻量级相关性感知门控机制，在弱对齐时无缝切换到仅多样性模式。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上的广泛实验展示了最先进的性能，特别是在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key是一个无需训练、计算高效且即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了长视频理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现出色，但其在复杂横向思维挑战（如字谜）中的认知过程仍然不透明。虽然近期研究表明这些模型在字谜解决方面存在显著困难，但底层的推理过程和失败模式尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含221个字谜的系统标注数据集，涵盖六个认知类别，并开发了将推理质量与答案正确性分离的评估框架。研究了三种提示策略，旨在引出不同类型的解释过程。

Result: 研究发现推理质量在不同谜题类别间差异显著，模型在视觉组合方面表现出系统性优势，但在缺失解释和文化象征方面存在根本性局限。提示策略显著影响认知方法和问题解决效果。

Conclusion: 可解释性应被视为模型性能的组成部分而非事后考虑，提示策略对模型认知过程和问题解决效果具有重要影响。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Motivation: 现有文本去除研究主要关注自然图像中的场景文本，但当前数据集存在领域泛化能力差、评估不准确的问题，特别是SCUT-EnsText等基准存在人工编辑伪影、背景过于简单、评估指标不能反映生成结果质量等局限性。

Method: 通过对象感知放置和视觉语言模型生成内容，在复杂背景上渲染文本，创建具有干净真实标签和挑战性文本去除场景的数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集解决了现有基准的局限性，为文本去除任务提供了更准确和具有挑战性的评估环境。

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 解决单一检测器在混合医学模态（如CXR、CT、MRI）上训练时，由于异构统计和分离表示空间导致的检测性能下降问题

Method: 使用文本导出的模态令牌编码成像模态，通过多模态上下文注意力（MoCA）将模态上下文传播到对象查询中，并引入QueryREPA预训练阶段通过对比目标对齐查询表示

Result: 该方法在多种模态联合训练时持续提升AP指标，且开销极小，无需架构修改

Conclusion: 为鲁棒的多模态医学目标检测提供了一条实用路径

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在视觉语言理解方面表现出色，但存在幻觉问题（生成与输入视觉和文本内容矛盾的内容）。现有方法如对比解码和注意力操作存在构建对比样本困难或稳定性不足的问题。

Method: 提出图像头掩码对比解码（MaskCD），利用LVLMs中的图像头，通过掩码它们来构建对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上的评估显示，MaskCD在CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉现象，同时保持了LVLMs的一般能力。

Conclusion: MaskCD是一种有效缓解大视觉语言模型幻觉问题的方法，通过掩码图像头构建对比样本，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: 通过将多模态医学数据视为序列帧并采用质量驱动选择机制，成功解决了K到N医学图像生成中的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Motivation: 需要准确、无损的鸡蛋质量评估方法以确保食品安全、维持产品标准和提高商业家禽生产效率。传统方法需要破坏性内部测量，而本研究首次仅使用外部特征进行内部质量评估。

Method: 构建包含186个褐壳蛋的公开数据集，使用预训练CNN模型提取图像特征，结合形状和重量特征，通过PCA降维、SMOTE增强，采用多种机器学习算法分类，最后通过集成投票机制提升准确率。

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in

*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的零样本图像描述框架，从图像中心转向补丁中心范式，无需区域级监督即可描述任意区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本描述模型局限于全局表示和整图描述，无法描述图像中的特定区域

Method: 将单个图像补丁作为原子描述单元，通过聚合补丁特征来描述任意区域（从单个补丁到非连续区域和整图）

Result: 使用DINO等生成有意义的密集视觉特征的主干网络，在多个基于区域的描述任务中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示对于可扩展的描述生成非常有效，在密集描述、区域集描述和新引入的轨迹描述任务中表现优异

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的简单方法，利用InternImage骨干网络特征，结合K-Means聚类和置信度阈值来检测语义分割中的分布外区域，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉基础模型在语义分割任务中检测分布外区域的能力尚未充分探索，这对于自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 使用InternImage骨干网络特征，应用K-Means聚类并结合解码器原始logits的置信度阈值来识别分布外聚类，无需任何异常监督。

Result: 在RoadAnomaly基准测试上达到50.02平均精度，在ADE-OoD基准测试上达到48.77平均精度，超越了多个监督和无监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明这是一种有前景的方向，可用于开发需要最少假设或额外数据的通用分布外分割方法。

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEACI-Net框架，通过运动增强和多模态交互改进压缩视频动作识别，解决动态信息粗糙和模态融合不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩视频动作识别虽然降低了存储和计算成本，但面临动态信息粗糙噪声大以及RGB和运动模态融合不足的问题。

Method: 采用双流架构，运动流使用多尺度块和去噪模块增强表示学习，通过SMC和CMA模块加强模态间交互。

Result: 在UCF-101、HMDB-51和Kinetics-400基准测试上表现出有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: MEACI-Net通过运动增强和跨模态交互机制，显著提升了压缩视频动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV是一个简单有效的视觉token剪枝框架，通过从全局视角重新思考token保留策略，在不同空间区域自适应分配剪枝预算，解决了现有基于注意力的剪枝方法在高剪枝率下性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，现有基于注意力机制的剪枝方法倾向于保留语义相似的token，在高剪枝率下会导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出HoloV框架，从整体视角重新设计token保留策略，通过在不同空间裁剪区域自适应分配剪枝预算，确保保留的token能够捕捉全局视觉上下文而非孤立的显著特征。

Result: 实验结果表明HoloV在各种任务、MLLM架构和剪枝率下均优于现有方法。例如，LLaVA1.5在使用HoloV剪枝88.9%视觉token后仍能保持95.8%的原始性能。

Conclusion: HoloV通过整体视角的token剪枝策略，最小化了表示崩溃，即使在激进剪枝下也能保持任务相关信息，实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAW方法增强视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，通过置信度感知损失和特征对齐正则化，在保持泛化能力的同时提升干净和对抗样本的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: CAW包含两个组件：置信度感知损失（通过缩放干净和对抗预测间的KL散度来优先处理不确定对抗样本）和特征对齐正则化（通过最小化冻结和微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离来保持语义一致性）。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个额外数据集上的实验表明，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR等最新方法，且内存使用更少。

Conclusion: CAW能有效提升视觉语言模型的零样本鲁棒性，在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下同时改善干净和对抗样本的准确率。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型视觉语言模型在颈动脉粥样硬化疾病风险评估中的应用，通过整合超声成像与临床数据，开发了一个基于LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna的领域适应模型，在卒中风险分层方面取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颈动脉粥样硬化疾病的风险评估需要整合多样化的临床和影像信息，但目前缺乏透明且可解释的临床工具。本研究旨在探索最先进的大型视觉语言模型在多模态颈动脉斑块评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出了一个通过访谈式问题序列模拟真实诊断场景的框架，比较了多种开源LVLM模型。使用低秩适应（LoRA）方法将LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna适应到超声领域，并整合多模态表格数据。

Result: 零样本实验显示，并非所有LVLM都能准确识别成像模式和解剖结构，所有模型在准确风险分类方面表现不佳。领域适应后的模型在卒中风险分层方面有显著改进，多模态数据整合进一步提高了特异性和平衡准确率，性能与先前在同一数据集上训练的CNN基线相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了LVLM在基于超声的心血管风险预测中的潜力和局限性，强调了多模态整合、模型校准和领域适应对于临床转化的重要性。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用深度自编码器生成器参数效率低，缺乏可解释的训练策略，需要改进多期相增强MRI合成中的特征分离

Method: 使用轻量级特征解耦VAE模型，将输入和目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的两个潜在分布，采用Y形双向训练策略

Result: 相比现有深度自编码器端到端合成方法，显著减少模型参数和推理时间，同时有效提高合成质量

Conclusion: FDA-VAE在多期相增强MRI合成中实现了高效的特征分离和高质量的图像合成

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了LPG-Bench基准测试和TIT评估方法，用于解决大模型在长文本提示图像生成中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在处理长而详细的提示时表现不佳，生成结果不一致，需要专门的评估基准和方法。

Method: 构建包含200个平均超过250词的长提示基准LPG-Bench，并提出基于文本-图像-文本一致性的TIT评估框架，包括TIT-Score和TIT-Score-LLM两种实现。

Result: TIT方法在人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有评估指标，TIT-Score-LLM在成对准确率上比最强基线提升7.31%。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench和TIT方法为评估和促进文本到图像模型发展提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法存在速度慢、几何失真、依赖手动3D掩码等问题，需要开发更实用和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 构建了3DEditVerse数据集（116,309个训练对和1,500个测试对），并提出3DEditFormer模型，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控机制来保持3D结构。

Result: 实验表明该框架在定量和定性评估中均优于现有最先进方法，建立了实用和可扩展3D编辑的新标准。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型成功解决了3D编辑的关键挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种云层注入算法来模拟真实云覆盖，并开发了轻量级方法将归一化差异指数注入解码层，以提升云覆盖条件下Sentinel-1雷达与光学数据融合的土地覆盖语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云图像，限制了在热带云层常见地区的实用性，需要解决云遮挡导致的光学图像数据缺失问题。

Method: 开发云层注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，并提出轻量级方法将归一化差异指数注入最终解码层，以保留关键空间特征，同时融合Sentinel-1雷达数据填补云遮挡的光学图像空白。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入使U-Net和DeepLabV3在无云图像上的性能分别提升1.99%和2.78%；在云覆盖条件下，融合Sentinel-1数据相比仅使用光学数据在所有模型上都取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学数据融合在具有挑战性的大气场景中非常有效，NDI注入方法能够以最小计算成本提升土地覆盖分割性能。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Result: 识别出两个关键因素：(i)训练目标的离散/连续分布特性，(ii)条件信息在训练期间提供构成概念信息的程度。基于这些发现，证明通过添加连续JEPA目标可以改进离散模型的组合性能。

Conclusion: 训练目标的分布特性和条件信息是影响组合泛化的关键因素，通过适当结合离散和连续目标可以提升视觉生成模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型潜在空间的图像扰动方法，通过改变去噪轨迹的起点来生成难以被下游生成模型反演和个性化的图像，在保持高视觉保真度的同时保护数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在个性化应用中的有效性增强，数据隐私、知识产权保护和未经授权使用等问题日益突出。现有基于像素空间的图像中毒方法存在噪声和伪影问题，需要更隐蔽的防御方法。

Method: 在扩散模型的潜在空间中操作，交替进行去噪和反演过程，同时修改去噪轨迹的起点。这种轨迹偏移采样方法将不可学习性集成到潜在扩散模型框架中。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、FID）上提升了约8%-10%，在五种对抗设置下的鲁棒性平均提升了约10%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且难以察觉的防御机制，能有效保护敏感数据免受未经授权的模型适应。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在辐射场语义蒸馏中几何基础特征与纯视觉特征的对比效果。研究发现几何基础特征包含更精细的几何细节，但在语义目标定位和姿态估计任务中表现不如纯视觉特征。作者提出了SPINE框架用于无初始猜测的辐射场反演。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在辐射场语义蒸馏中，几何基础语义特征是否比纯视觉特征更具优势，特别是在空间任务如姿态估计中的表现。

Method: 提出SPINE框架，包含两个核心组件：使用蒸馏语义的粗反演和使用光度优化的细反演。比较几何基础特征与纯视觉特征在多个任务中的表现。

Result: 几何基础特征包含更精细的结构细节，但在语义目标定位任务中无明显差异，在姿态估计任务中准确性反而下降。纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中表现出更好的通用性。

Conclusion: 纯视觉特征在更广泛的下游任务中具有更好的通用性，尽管几何基础特征包含更多几何细节。未来需要研究更有效的几何基础策略来增强预训练语义特征的通用性和性能。

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

### [44] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete是一个新颖的参考驱动图像补全框架，通过引入显式3D结构指导来增强几何一致性，显著优于现有仅依赖扩散先验的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成的方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），导致补全区域出现错位或不合理内容。当目标视图与参考图像差异较大时，这一问题尤为严重。

Method: 提出双分支扩散架构：一个分支从掩码目标合成缺失区域，另一个分支从投影点云提取几何特征。通过联合自注意力确保一致性，并采用目标感知掩码策略指导模型关注相关参考线索。

Result: 实验表明GeoComplete在PSNR指标上比最先进方法提升了17.1，显著提高了几何准确性同时保持高视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何感知的双分支扩散架构和目标感知掩码策略，GeoComplete为几何条件图像补全提供了统一且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到音视频生成中的两个关键挑战：单一共享文本标题导致的模态干扰，以及跨模态特征交互机制不明确的问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉引导字幕框架生成解耦的视频和音频字幕，并设计桥接扩散变换器使用双交叉注意力机制实现双向信息交换。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在大多数指标上达到了最先进的结果，并通过消融研究验证了各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来文本到音视频生成任务提供了关键见解，所有代码和检查点将公开发布。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

TL;DR: HAVIR模型通过分离视觉皮层的两个层次区域，分别提取结构和语义特征，结合潜在扩散模型，显著提升了从脑活动重建视觉信息的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂视觉刺激时面临挑战，因为自然场景的低级特征具有异质性，而高级特征存在语义纠缠。

Method: 将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：结构生成器从空间处理体素提取结构信息并转换为潜在扩散先验，语义提取器将语义处理体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion模型合成最终图像。

Result: 实验结果表明HAVIR在复杂场景中提升了重建图像的结构和语义质量，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 基于视觉皮层层次表示理论的HAVIR模型有效解决了从脑活动重建视觉信息的挑战，特别是在复杂场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: Mask2IV是一个用于交互中心视频生成的两阶段框架，无需密集掩码输入，通过预测动作轨迹来生成高质量的人机交互视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成交互中心视频对具身智能至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂动态交互，且获取精确掩码标注在实际应用中具有挑战性。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段流程：首先预测执行者和对象的合理运动轨迹，然后基于这些轨迹生成视频。支持通过动作描述或空间位置线索来指导运动轨迹。

Result: 在涵盖人机交互和机器人操作场景的两个基准测试中，该方法在视觉真实性和可控性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Mask2IV框架在无需密集掩码输入的情况下，实现了高质量的交互中心视频生成，提供了灵活直观的控制方式。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱疾病影响全球6.19亿人，是导致残疾的主要原因，但AI辅助诊断因缺乏椎体级别感知的多模态数据集而受限。临床决策需要跨X光、CT和MRI在特定椎体级别进行复杂推理。

Method: 与执业脊柱外科医生共同设计，采用临床医生参与的两阶段LLM生成方法（草稿和修订），从教科书、指南、开放数据集和约1000个医院病例中构建包含45万条指令实例的数据集。

Result: 在SpineBench上的全面评估显示，现有大型视觉语言模型在细粒度椎体级别推理方面存在系统性弱点，而基于SpineMed-450k微调的模型在所有任务上均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: 临床医生评估证实了该模型输出的诊断清晰度和实际效用，为脊柱疾病AI辅助诊断提供了可靠的数据集和评估标准。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

Result: 大量实验表明，UniShield取得了最先进的结果，超越了现有的统一方法和领域特定检测器，突显了其卓越的实用性、自适应性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: UniShield通过多智能体架构成功解决了伪造图像检测领域的跨域泛化和自适应问题，为维护信息完整性和社会安全提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Method: 提出PQGAN量化图像自编码器，在VQGAN的向量量化框架中集成产品量化。通过分析码本大小、嵌入维度和子空间分解之间的相互作用，将向量和标量量化作为特例。

Result: PSNR达到37dB（先前工作为27dB），FID、LPIPS和CMMD分数降低高达96%。发现VQ和PQ在扩展嵌入维度时性能表现相反，为超参数选择提供指导。

Conclusion: PQGAN能够无缝集成到预训练扩散模型中，实现更快速、计算效率更高的生成，或在不增加成本的情况下将输出分辨率提高一倍，表明PQ是图像合成中离散潜在表示的有力扩展。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了Memory Forcing学习框架，通过混合训练和链式前向训练结合几何索引空间记忆，解决视频扩散模型在有限计算预算下长期空间一致性与新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在Minecraft游戏等应用中需要同时生成自然的新场景内容并在重新访问已探索区域时保持空间一致性。在有限计算预算下，模型必须在有限上下文窗口中压缩和利用历史线索，这暴露了一个权衡：仅时间记忆缺乏长期空间一致性，而添加空间记忆可能因模型过度依赖不充分的空间上下文而降低新场景生成质量。

Method: 1. 混合训练：暴露不同的游戏玩法机制，引导模型在探索时依赖时间记忆，在重新访问时结合空间记忆。2. 链式前向训练：通过模型rollout扩展自回归训练，链式预测创建更大的姿态变化并鼓励依赖空间记忆来保持一致性。3. 点对帧检索：通过将当前可见点映射到其源帧来高效检索历史。4. 增量3D重建：维护和更新显式3D缓存。

Result: 广泛实验表明，Memory Forcing在不同环境中实现了卓越的长期空间一致性和生成质量，同时在扩展序列中保持计算效率。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing框架通过精心设计的训练协议和几何索引空间记忆，成功解决了视频扩散模型中长期空间一致性与新场景生成质量之间的权衡问题，为世界建模和交互式场景生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Method: 利用单模态和跨模态表示构建统一潜在空间，捕捉模态间的复杂依赖关系。

Result: MonSTeR优于仅依赖单模态表示的三模态模型，检索分数与人类偏好一致，并在零样本场景物体放置和运动描述任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MonSTeR为运动-场景-文本对齐评估提供了有效工具，展示了其潜在空间的多样性和实用性。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机共振的测试时防御机制，通过引入微小平移扰动来对抗对抗性攻击，无需额外训练或网络模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖特征过滤或平滑，可能导致信息损失。本文旨在开发一种既能增强鲁棒性又能最小化信息损失的通用防御机制。

Method: 引入小幅度平移扰动到输入图像，对齐变换后的特征嵌入并聚合，然后映射回原始参考图像。该方法具有闭式解，可部署于各种网络架构。

Result: 在图像分类任务中恢复高达68.1%的准确率损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流中恢复29.2%，在各种对抗攻击下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法完全无需训练、架构无关且攻击无关，首次为密集预测任务建立了通用的测试时防御机制，具有出色的实用性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机神经网络方法主要关注改进跨信息预测，但没有对整体随机网络架构进行显著改进。

Method: 利用超球面随机嵌入结合双分支学习模块，并通过新制定的优化问题构建丰富的纹理表示。

Result: 在多个具有不同特征和挑战的纯纹理基准测试中取得了有趣的结果。

Conclusion: Mixer方法在纹理识别任务中表现出色，源代码将在发表后提供。

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RULER tokens和I-MRoPE两种创新方法，通过显式坐标标记和对称空间编码，解决了GUI grounding任务中高分辨率显示器的坐标映射问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在GUI grounding任务中面临核心瓶颈：可靠的补丁到像素映射在训练未见的高分辨率显示器上失效，导致坐标生成不准确。

Method: 1. RULER tokens作为显式坐标标记器，让模型能够像地图上的网格线一样参考位置；2. Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE)改进空间编码，确保宽度和高度维度对称表示。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-V2和ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验显示，接地准确性持续提升，在高分辨率界面上改进最大。

Conclusion: 通过提供显式空间指导而非依赖隐式学习，该方法能够在不同分辨率和平台上实现更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在通用视觉基准上表现良好，但在医学影像等专业领域的分布外任务中表现不佳，这些领域标注数据有限且昂贵

Method: 利用少量标注VQA样本和大量未标注图像，通过经过标题蒸馏正则化的QA生成器生成领域相关伪问答对，并选择性更新与问答最相关的神经元

Result: 在胃肠道内窥镜和体育VQA上的实验表明，LEAML在最小监督下持续优于标准微调

Conclusion: LEAML框架在标签稀缺的专业领域VQA任务中表现出有效性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

### [59] [Hallucination reduction with CASAL: Contrastive Activation Steering For Amortized Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02324)
*Wannan Yang,Xinchi Qiu,Lei Yu,Yuchen Zhang,Oliver Aobo Yang,Narine Kokhlikyan,Nicola Cancedda,Diego Garcia-Olano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASAL是一种高效的对比激活引导算法，通过将激活引导的好处直接融入模型权重，让LLM在知道答案时回答，不知道时拒绝回答，减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比LoRA基线高30倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉，自信地提供错误答案而不是承认无知。现有激活引导方法需要实时监控和干预，缺乏实用性。

Method: CASAL连接可解释性与摊销优化，仅训练单个Transformer层的子模块，将激活引导效果直接烘焙到模型权重中。

Result: 在多个短问答基准上减少幻觉30%-40%，计算效率比SFT和DPO等LoRA基线高30倍，数据效率高20倍，在OOD领域也有效泛化。

Conclusion: CASAL是将可解释性方法应用于实际部署的有前景的步骤，首次证明对密集和MoE模型都有效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often
hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting
ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of
their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations.
These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during
inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning
(CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized
optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into
model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining
from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training
only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by
30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more
compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines
such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce
domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in
both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first
steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both
dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step
forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment
in production systems.

TL;DR: RA-FSM是一个基于GPT的模块化研究助手，通过有限状态机控制循环（相关性→置信度→知识）来减少幻觉和错误引用，提供带有置信度标签和去重引用的答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文献综述中能加速工作，但存在幻觉和错误引用问题，限制了在专家工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 采用有限状态机控制循环，结合向量检索和确定性引用流程，通过控制器过滤超出范围的查询、评分可回答性、分解问题，仅在需要时触发检索。

Result: 在盲测A/B评估中，领域专家更倾向于RA-FSM而非Notebook LM和标准GPT API，认为其边界条件处理更好，证据使用更可靠。

Conclusion: 该系统为高风险技术工作提供透明、有充分引用的答案，可推广到其他科学领域，但会带来可调节的延迟和成本开销。

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and
mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM
(Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research
assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance ->
Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a
deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries,
scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when
needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated
references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base
from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a
dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We
implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories:
analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative
synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews,
domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla
Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition
handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses
indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency
and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for
high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合架构，结合了实时语音到语音模型的低延迟和级联系统的知识优势，通过在S2S生成过程中实时注入LLM的文本响应来提升语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时语音对话系统中低延迟与深度知识理解之间的权衡问题，传统S2S模型响应快但缺乏语义深度，而级联系统知识丰富但延迟高。

Method: 采用混合架构：用户语音同时输入S2S变换器进行即时响应，并传递给后端LLM处理；LLM的文本响应实时注入指导S2S模型的语音生成。

Result: 在语音合成的MT-Bench基准测试中，系统在响应正确性上显著优于基线S2S模型，接近级联系统水平，同时保持了与基线相当的延迟。

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功平衡了实时响应性和知识深度，为语音对话系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural,
low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic
understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech
recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech
synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency,
which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel
hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our
framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate
responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end
LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the
S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich
knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated
our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that
consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate
that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response
correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency
on par with the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下表现不佳，主要存在两个推理瓶颈：内在推理瓶颈忽略医学图像细节，外在推理瓶颈未能整合专业医学知识。

Method: 提出AMANDA框架，通过LLM代理进行医学知识增强：内在知识增强采用粗到细的问题分解进行综合诊断，外在知识增强通过生物医学知识图谱检索来支撑推理过程。

Result: 在八个Med-VQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，在零样本和少样本设置下都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: AMANDA框架有效解决了医疗多模态大语言模型在低资源环境下的推理瓶颈问题，无需额外训练即可显著提升医疗视觉问答性能。

Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise
in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in
low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing
Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks:
(i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the
medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to
incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we
propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical
knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical
knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for
comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds
the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive
experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial
improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is

TL;DR: SelfJudge通过自监督训练验证器来提升推测解码性能，通过评估语义保持来放宽验证标准，在多种NLP任务上实现更好的推理速度-准确率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的judge解码方法依赖人工标注或可验证真实值的任务，限制了在多样化NLP任务中的通用性。

Method: 通过目标模型的自监督训练验证器，通过评估替换标记后的响应是否保持原始响应的语义来训练验证器。

Result: 实验显示SelfJudge在推理速度与准确率的权衡上优于现有的judge解码基线方法。

Conclusion: SelfJudge为更快的LLM推理提供了一个广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens
from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts
this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that
may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods
are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable
ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose
SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target
model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether
token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses,
enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments
show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge
decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM
inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出EntropyLong方法，利用预测不确定性验证长距离依赖质量，通过识别高熵位置、检索相关上下文并验证其信息增益，构建具有真实长距离依赖的训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文语言模型训练方法（如通用文本拼接或基于启发式的方法）无法保证真正的长距离依赖关系，需要专门的数据构建方法。

Method: EntropyLong方法：1）识别文档中的高熵位置；2）从大型语料库中检索语义相关上下文；3）通过评估是否降低预测熵来验证上下文效用；4）将原始文档与验证后的上下文补充结合构建训练样本。

Result: 使用FineWebEdu和Cosmopedia构建了128K长度序列的数据集，训练模型在RULER基准测试中显著提升，特别是在需要远距离信息的任务上。指令微调后在LongBenchv2上也取得显著进步。

Conclusion: 基于熵的验证对于长上下文训练是必要且有效的，能够确保依赖关系代表可测量的信息增益而非虚假相关。

Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies
requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic
text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee
genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data
construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency
quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves
semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility
by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop
verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain
rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range
dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual
supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of
128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data
demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks
requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models
also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced
long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the
necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context
training.

Motivation: 语言模型在对话推荐系统中具有巨大潜力，但缺乏公开的CRS数据使得微调变得困难。现有的用户模拟器作为数据生成器往往缺乏行为一致性，生成的对话序列与真实用户行为不一致。

Method: 开发了一种结合行为模拟器和语言模型提示的方法，用于生成与用户底层状态一致的自然对话。通过这种方法创建了一个包含偏好获取和示例批评的大规模开源CRS数据集。

Result: 评估显示生成的对话在一致性、事实性和自然性方面表现良好，证明了该方法在生成高质量CRS数据方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成行为一致、事实准确且自然的对话数据，为训练语言模型驱动的对话推荐系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational
recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning
LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data
generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral
consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real
user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural
dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior
simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating
a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example
critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit
considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

TL;DR: 提出look-ahead Sync方法解决神经语言隐写中的标记化歧义问题，在保持可证明安全性的同时显著提升嵌入容量，相比SyncPool方法在英语中嵌入率提升超过160%，中文中提升25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经语言隐写中因现代分词器标记化歧义导致的解码失败问题，同时克服SyncPool方法牺牲嵌入容量的局限性。

Method: 提出look-ahead Sync方法，仅在真正不可区分的标记序列上进行最小化同步采样，同时策略性地保留所有其他可辨别路径以最大化嵌入容量。

Result: 在英语（使用Llama 3）和中文（使用Qwen 2.5）基准测试中，该方法持续接近理论容量上限，显著优于SyncPool，在较大候选池设置中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用高容量可证明安全语言隐写迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental
challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers,
which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool,
addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of
ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it
utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for
synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named
look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while
retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal
synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while
strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding
capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and
analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical
upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen
2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical
capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in
embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in
settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step
toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of
semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build
them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from
OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves,
points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A
novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media
posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and
semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and
Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and
FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris

customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior
modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based

compatibility in a reusable framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as
generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases.
Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI
safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter
gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that
diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and
its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to
provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training
data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking
harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge
contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at
sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis,
precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence
model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand,
audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了FormalML基准测试，用于评估LLM在数学证明子目标补全任务中的表现，发现现有模型在准确性和效率方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM作为数学家实际助手的能力，填补复杂证明中缺失步骤的子目标补全任务尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建FormalML基准测试，包含4937个来自机器学习基础理论的Lean 4问题，使用翻译策略将过程式证明转换为声明式形式。

Result: 评估最先进的证明器显示在准确性和效率方面存在持续局限性。

Conclusion: 需要更强大的基于LLM的定理证明器来实现有效的子目标补全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants
for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains
underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion,
where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left
unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce
FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine
learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into
declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and
probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the
first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex
research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights
persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for
more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

TL;DR: 本文创建了首个库尔德语语义文本相似度数据集，包含10,000个句子对，并评估了多种基线模型，为低资源语言NLP研究提供了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高资源语言有丰富的语义文本相似度资源，但库尔德语等低资源语言仍然缺乏相关数据集和评估基准。

Method: 构建了包含10,000个句子对的库尔德语STS数据集，涵盖正式和非正式语域，并使用Sentence-BERT、多语言BERT等基线模型进行基准测试。

Result: 获得了有竞争力的结果，同时揭示了库尔德语形态学、正字法变异和语码混合带来的挑战。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基线模型为库尔德语语义学和低资源NLP的未来研究建立了可复现的评估套件和坚实基础。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap
between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist
for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain
underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset:
10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated
for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong
baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising
from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset
and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong
starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

*Ishak Soltani,Francisco Belo,Bernardo Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRACQ是一个多维评估框架，用于评估文档在五个特质上的表现：连贯性、严谨性、适当性、完整性和质量。该框架基于特征自动评分方法，扩展应用于机器生成文本，提供基于评分标准的可解释自动化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单一评分方法无法全面评估文档质量，需要开发能够同时进行整体和特征层面分析的多维评估框架，为机器生成文本提供更稳定和可解释的评估。

Method: 基于特征自动评分方法，整合语言、语义和结构信号进行累积评估。在500个合成资助提案上训练，并与LLM作为评判者进行基准测试，同时在强弱真实应用上进行测试。

Result: 初步结果表明，CRACQ比直接LLM评估产生更稳定和可解释的特征层面判断，但在可靠性和领域范围方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: CRACQ框架为机器生成文本提供了有效的多维评估方法，在稳定性和可解释性方面优于直接LLM评估，但需要进一步改进可靠性和扩展领域适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents CRACQ, a multi-dimensional evaluation framework tailored
to evaluate documents across f i v e specific traits: Coherence, Rigor,
Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Building on insights from
traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond
essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a
rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike
singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural
signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level
analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked
against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real
applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and
interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though
challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

*Samyak Jhaveri,Praphul Singh,Jangwon Kim,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成评估的强化学习框架，用于生成长篇临床文本，通过GRPO和DocLens评估器直接优化事实基础和完整性，无需单独训练奖励模型或依赖人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化临床文档生成需要与完整性、事实基础等优先事项精确对齐，现有方法依赖人工参考或单独奖励模型训练，成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)与DocLens评估器结合的方法，DocLens提供基于对话的确定性奖励，通过简单的奖励门控策略降低训练成本。

Result: 该方法提高了临床笔记质量，GPT-5定性评估显示在事实性、完整性和简洁性方面GRPO输出更受青睐，遗漏和幻觉更少。

Conclusion: 该框架可扩展到真实世界场景，能够整合自定义目标如指南遵循或计费偏好，由于基准相对干净且基础模型已较好对齐，改进可能代表保守下限。

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise
alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We
present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form
clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic,
dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and
completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on
human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note
quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An
independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing
higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity,
with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively
clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely
represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world
settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or
billing preferences.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在论证性大语言模型(ArgLLMs)中集成不确定性量化(UQ)方法，通过实验评估不同UQ方法在声明验证任务中的表现，发现简单的直接提示策略优于更复杂的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在关键决策中的应用日益增多，确保其可靠性变得至关重要。不确定性量化方法能够评估模型预测的置信度，这对于基于论证的决策系统尤为重要。

Method: 在论证性大语言模型框架中集成不同的LLM UQ方法，并在声明验证任务上进行实验评估，比较各种UQ方法的有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管直接提示方法简单，但在ArgLLMs中是一种有效的UQ策略，显著优于更复杂的方法。

Conclusion: 在论证性大语言模型中，简单的直接提示方法可以作为有效的UQ策略，为复杂声明验证任务提供了可靠的不确定性评估。

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs)
is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this
groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in
argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making
based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We
conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification
tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment
of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself
is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when
intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results
demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ
strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过提示让大语言模型模拟早期知识截止点的能力，发现提示方法在直接查询特定日期后信息时有效，但在处理因果相关但未直接询问的遗忘内容时效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在时间预测任务中广泛使用，但其依赖预训练数据存在污染问题，准确预测可能反映的是记忆而非推理能力，导致对其泛化能力的高估。随着基于提示的遗忘技术出现，需要研究LLMs能否通过提示模拟早期知识截止点。

Method: 构建了三个评估数据集来测试LLMs遗忘能力：(1)直接事实知识，(2)语义变化，(3)因果相关知识。使用提示技术模拟早期知识截止点。

Result: 基于提示的模拟知识截止点在直接查询特定日期后信息时显示有效性，但在诱导遗忘因果相关但未直接询问的内容时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在将LLMs应用于时间预测任务时需要更严格的评估设置。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but
their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate
predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than
reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability.
With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural
question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff?
In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier
knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the
extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic
shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while
prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly
queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce
forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally
related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous
evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Yifan Wang,Bolian Li,Junlin Wu,Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheli Liu,Ruqi Zhang,Ananth Grama,Qingkai Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种基于用户不满意信号的迭代偏好训练方法，利用真实世界中的用户修正和偏好表达来训练LLM，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界LLM部署中，用户不满意信号（如修正、迭代）很丰富，而显式满意反馈稀缺。现有偏好学习方法与这种数据分布不匹配。

Method: DRIFT以真实世界不满意信号为锚点，从不断演化的策略中动态采样正例进行训练，避免梯度退化并保持偏好边界。

Result: 在WildBench和AlpacaEval2基准上，DRIFT相比基线方法提升显著（7B模型+6.23%/+8.95%，14B模型+7.61%/+12.29%），14B模型甚至超越GPT-4o-mini。

Conclusion: DRIFT是利用最丰富和最有信息量的信号进行现实世界后训练的有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems,
code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user
dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through
refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit
satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches
are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human
annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative
pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world
DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy.
Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets
and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) /
+7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B)
on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods
such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are
particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on
WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory
capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to
narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves
preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show
that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training
that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

TL;DR: SIMPACT是一个用于构建社交媒体模拟数据集的框架，包含BluePrint数据集，专注于政治话语分析，支持训练基于LLM的社交媒体代理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏用于微调和评估LLM作为真实社交媒体代理的标准化数据资源，难以进行大规模社交媒体动态的伦理研究。

Method: 提出SIMPACT框架，将下一行动预测作为任务，使用匿名化用户数据构建行为基础的数据集，包含12种社交媒体互动类型。

Result: 发布了BluePrint大规模数据集，基于Bluesky数据，通过聚类匿名用户行为构建人物角色，保护隐私的同时捕获真实互动模式。

Conclusion: SIMPACT为推进严谨、负责任的社交媒体模拟提供了数据标准化和评估协议基础，可用于研究错误信息和极化等挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating
social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or
logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks
standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic
social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the
SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting
framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable
for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for
training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the
cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic
realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale
dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse.
BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours,
capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through
pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The
dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types
(likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity
preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use
context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction
behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data
and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous,
ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an
evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for
building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation
and polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于动态专家聚类和结构化压缩的统一框架，解决MoE LLMs中的负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE大型语言模型面临的三个核心问题：负载不平衡、参数冗余和通信开销，这些因素限制了MoE模型的实际部署效率。

Method: 采用动态专家聚类方法，基于参数和激活相似性定期重组专家；将专家权重分解为共享基础矩阵和极低秩残差适配器；实现两阶段分层路由策略；使用异构精度方案和动态卸载机制。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103上评估，框架在保持标准MoE模型质量的同时，将总参数减少约80%，吞吐量提升10-20%，专家负载方差降低3倍以上。

Conclusion: 结构重组是实现可扩展、高效和内存有效的MoE LLMs的原则性路径，证明了通过动态架构重配置可以获得显著效率提升。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load
imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a
unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression
to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering
procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter
and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic
embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's
architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each
cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely
low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per
group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage
hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to
specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and
the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision
scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled
with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption
to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our
framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total
parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and
lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates
that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient,
and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Motivation: 探索生成式AI和大型语言模型在教育中的应用潜力，特别是开发能够在教育环境中提供基于课程指导的AI教学助手，同时解决LLMs的高计算成本和能源消耗问题。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，对包括LLaMA 3.1、IBM Granite 3.3和Gemma 3在内的8个小型语言模型(7-17B参数)进行基准测试，并与GPT-4o进行比较。

Result: 研究发现，通过适当的提示和针对性检索，小型语言模型能够提供准确且符合教学要求的回答，其性能可与大型语言模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型不仅具有成本效益和隐私保护优势，还更加环保，是教育机构在可持续和节能方式下扩展个性化学习的可行AI教学助手解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education
is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of
AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source
small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1,
IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings
show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in
delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer
significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy
requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without
depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and
privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as
viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale
personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vec2vec方法虽然能实现近乎完美的文本嵌入空间对齐，但计算成本高且不稳定，需要更高效、更稳健的替代方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：伪并行嵌入向量的初步匹配、变换拟合和迭代优化，最终学习得到线性变换映射。

Result: mini-vec2vec在效率上比原始vec2vec提升数个数量级，同时达到或超越其性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法稳定性高、算法步骤可解释，便于扩展应用，为在新领域和学科中的采用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces
without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is
expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient
alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly
robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method
consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel
embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear
alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of
magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The
method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and
unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

*Dzmitry Pihulski,Karol Charchut,Viktoria Novogrodskaia,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSQL是对WikiSQL数据集的系统性修订和转换，旨在解决原数据集的结构和标注问题，为LLM时代提供干净的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WikiSQL数据集在早期NL2SQL研究中发挥了关键作用，但由于存在大小写敏感不一致、数据类型不匹配、语法错误和未回答问题等结构性和标注问题，其使用率下降。需要为现代自然语言到SQL模型提供更合适的基准。

Method: 对WikiSQL中的错误进行分类，并实施自动化的清理和重新标注方法。将原始数据集转换为提供干净自然语言问题和完整SQL查询的纯文本格式。

Result: 评估了多个大型语言模型（包括Gemma 3、LLaMA 3.2、Mistral 7B等），展示了改进后数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMSQL不是简单的更新，而是专门为LLM准备的基准，与原始WikiSQL针对指针网络模型不同，它提供了干净的自然语言问题和完整SQL查询，便于现代自然语言到SQL模型的直接生成和评估。

Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables
non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a
central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset
played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to
structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies,
data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present
LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the
LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning
and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated
multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral
7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and
others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready
benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models
selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions
and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and
evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

TL;DR: 研究探索大型语言模型在不同政治文化视角下评估政治言论冒犯性的能力，发现具有显式推理能力的大模型在意识形态和文化差异敏感性方面表现更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何从特定政治和文化视角评估政治话语的冒犯性，探索模型在不同意识形态和语言背景下的表现差异。

Method: 使用MD-Agreement数据集中2020年美国选举推文的多语言子集，评估多个LLM从不同政治立场（极右翼、保守派、中立派、进步派）判断推文冒犯性的能力，涵盖英语、波兰语和俄语语境。

Result: 具有显式推理能力的大模型（如DeepSeek-R1、o4-mini）在意识形态和文化差异敏感性方面表现更一致，而较小模型往往无法捕捉细微差别。推理能力显著提高了冒犯性判断的个性化和可解释性。

Conclusion: 推理机制是使LLM适应跨语言和意识形态的微妙社会政治文本分类的关键，显式推理能力对于模型在复杂社会政治语境中的表现至关重要。

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political
discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives.
Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from
the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1,
o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets
as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas
(far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and
Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning
abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to
ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture
subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve
both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments,
suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced
sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型中的偏见已被研究，但具有音频输入输出的语音对话模型中的偏见特性尚未被探索。副语言特征（如年龄、性别、口音）可能影响模型输出，多轮对话可能加剧偏见，对决策和推荐任务的公平性产生影响。

Method: 使用群体不公平分数（GUS）衡量决策偏见，基于相似性的归一化统计率（SNSR）衡量推荐偏见，评估开源模型（Qwen2.5-Omni、GLM-4-Voice）和闭源API（GPT-4o Audio、Gemini-2.5-Flash）。

Result: 闭源模型总体偏见较低，开源模型对年龄和性别更敏感，推荐任务会放大跨群体差异，多轮对话中偏见决策可能持续存在。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究端到端语音对话模型偏见的论文，为构建公平可靠的音频交互系统提供见解，并发布了FairDialogue数据集和评估代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and
cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their
presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input
and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age,
gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn
conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications
for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of
multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using

TL;DR: 通过视觉和语言模型分析大脑语言皮层对句子的神经响应，发现聚合多个生成图像或文本释义的嵌入表示能更准确预测神经活动，表明语言皮层存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类语言系统中语义表征的抽象程度，验证语言皮层是否包含独立于语言形式的抽象意义表征。

Method: 使用视觉和语言模型生成句子对应的图像和释义，提取其嵌入表示，建模这些表示与语言皮层神经响应的关系。

Result: 聚合多个生成图像的嵌入能准确预测神经响应，有时甚至优于大型语言模型；丰富释义的上下文细节能进一步提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 语言皮层中存在高度抽象、形式独立的语义表征，其语义表征比语言模型更丰富和广泛。

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but
the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we
searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by
modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and
language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract
vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated
images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses,
sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings
across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared
to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that
may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like
"maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing
predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that
the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than
language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly
abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的自回归解码方式导致延迟增加，现有推测解码方法仍依赖自回归草稿器，限制了时钟加速效果。

Method: 使用扩散语言模型生成多令牌草稿，引入因果一致性路径搜索从令牌网格中提取左到右路径，并采用自适应草稿长度控制器动态调整提案大小。

Result: 在基准测试中，DiffuSpec实现了高达3倍的时钟加速，证明了基于扩散的草稿生成是自回归草稿器的可靠替代方案。

Conclusion: 扩散模型草稿生成为推测解码提供了有效的替代方法，通过单次前向传递和多令牌生成显著提升解码效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the
autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token
requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by
employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified
in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR
drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the
drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that
uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts
in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR
verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,
parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally
highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right
path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a
speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two
practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this
lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and
(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size
based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across
benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing
diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for
speculative decoding.

Motivation: 当前排放相关知识分散且高度专业化，现有获取和编译排放数据的方法效率低下，这阻碍了非专家理解排放信息，给研究和管理带来挑战。

Method: 基于超过10,000份文档构建的知识库，结合提示工程和问题补全技术，支持自然语言交互式排放数据分析，包括查询可视化清单、分析源贡献和推荐排放因子。

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate
understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions.
However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized,
while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain
inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret
emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address
this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent
tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge
base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and
peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and
question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering.
Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via
natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing
source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined
scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT
can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral
trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible
architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows,
positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission
inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型集体中会出现沉默螺旋效应，历史信号和人物设定共同作用时会产生强烈的多数意见主导，重现沉默螺旋模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉默螺旋理论原本适用于人类社会，但大型语言模型缺乏人类心理机制，因此需要探究纯粹统计语言生成是否也能产生类似沉默螺旋的动态。

Method: 提出评估框架，通过控制历史信号和人物设定四种条件，使用趋势测试和集中度测量来分析意见动态。

Result: 实验显示历史和人物设定共同作用产生强烈多数主导和沉默螺旋模式；仅历史信号导致强锚定效应；仅人物设定产生多样但无关联意见。

Conclusion: 研究连接计算社会学和负责任AI设计，强调需要监控和减轻LLM代理系统中出现的从众现象。

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views
often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority
positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language
models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly
applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central
question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical
language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for
examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled
conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona'
signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall
and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and
interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models
show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and
replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and
persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that
without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges
computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to
monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChunkLLM是一个轻量级可插拔的训练框架，通过QK适配器和分块适配器解决Transformer自注意力机制二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型在自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现出色，但由于自注意力机制的二次复杂度导致计算效率低下。现有的分块选择和压缩方法存在语义不完整或训练推理效率差的问题。

Method: 提出ChunkLLM框架，包含QK适配器（Q-Adapter和K-Adapter）和分块适配器。QK适配器用于特征压缩和分块注意力获取，分块适配器用于检测分块边界。训练时只训练适配器参数，骨干网络保持冻结，并设计了注意力蒸馏方法。推理时仅在检测到分块边界时触发分块选择。

Result: 在多个长短文本基准数据集上的实验表明，ChunkLLM在短文本基准上达到可比性能，在长上下文基准上保持98.64%性能，同时保留48.58%的键值缓存。在处理120K长文本时，相比原始Transformer最高加速4.48倍。

Conclusion: ChunkLLM有效解决了Transformer的计算效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，为长文本处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and
computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the
self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers
have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to
alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic
incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively
address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable
training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter
(Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each
Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk
attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the
model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic
information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain
frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training.
Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK
Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference
phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is
detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference.
Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and
short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only
attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains
98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58%
key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum
speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of
120K long texts.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析多个大语言模型对罗马尼亚争议性历史问题的回答，评估其在不同语言和语境下的偏见与不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史常因文化和国家意识形态而被扭曲呈现，大语言模型训练数据的偏见会传递给用户，本研究旨在揭示这种缺乏中立性的问题。

Method: 研究分三个阶段进行：首先让LLM回答争议性问题，然后要求用数值评分回答相同问题，观察回答方式对模型思维的影响。

Result: 二元回答稳定性相对较高但不完美，且因语言而异；模型常在不同语言或格式间改变立场；数值评分常与初始二元选择不一致；最一致的模型不一定最准确或中立。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在特定语言语境下存在不一致性的倾向，强调了LLM回答的语境依赖性。

Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical
questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across
languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study
mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the
recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives,
primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large
language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may
present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled
in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the
idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the
response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question,
an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question
again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results
show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and
varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between
formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and
the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or
neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such
inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the
question asked.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖环境级手册和任务级指导，但忽视了实例级上下文的重要性。在复杂任务中，智能体的成功往往依赖于对具体环境实例中可验证事实的掌握，如物体位置、制作配方等。

Method: 提出任务无关的ILCL方法，使用紧凑的TODO森林指导探索优先级，通过轻量级的计划-执行-提取循环自动生成高精度、可重用的上下文文档。

Result: 在TextWorld、ALFWorld和Crafter上的实验显示，ReAct在TextWorld中的平均成功率从37%提升至95%，IGE从81%提升至95%，在效率和成功率方面均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 通过将一次性探索转化为持久可重用的知识，该方法补充了现有上下文，能够实现更可靠和高效的LLM智能体。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i)
environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules,
and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this
work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context,
instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to
a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes,
and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a
common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often
depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on
making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context
requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring,
validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We
formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce
our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration,
using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a
lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically
produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many
downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost.
Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent
gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate
in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By
transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our
method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM
agents.

TL;DR: 本文研究了训练条件如何影响语言模型使用上下文知识和参数知识，以及它们之间的仲裁策略。通过控制实验发现，文档内事实重复有助于发展这两种能力，而训练语料中的不一致信息和分布偏差能促进模型学习鲁棒的仲裁策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成方法面临知识冲突问题：模型要么不加批判地接受外部知识而容易受到错误信息影响，要么过于依赖参数知识而无法从检索中获益。缺乏对训练过程中知识仲裁策略形成机制的系统理解，导致预训练模型可能产生不良的仲裁行为，浪费计算资源。

Method: 在合成传记语料库上训练基于Transformer的语言模型，系统控制各种训练条件，包括文档内事实重复、信息不一致性和分布偏差等，研究这些条件如何影响模型使用参数知识和上下文知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明：文档内事实重复有助于发展参数和上下文能力；包含不一致信息或分布偏差的训练语料能促进模型学习鲁棒的仲裁策略；这些非理想特性对于学习鲁棒仲裁很重要，而非需要移除的伪影。

Conclusion: 研究结果为预训练模型提供了具体的实证指导，帮助模型和谐地整合参数知识和上下文知识，揭示了训练语料中某些看似不理想的特性实际上对学习鲁棒的知识仲裁策略至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge
retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during
pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable
to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge
fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of
retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of
what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks
producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and,
consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining
budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first
controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context
and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train
transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while
systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that
intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric
and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains
inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop
robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather
than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results
indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These
insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that
harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种内存增强的小型语言模型架构，通过访问大型分层参数化内存库来存储世界知识，解决了传统模型需要将所有知识压缩到参数中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖参数扩展来提升性能，但将所有世界知识压缩到参数中既没有必要（每次提示只使用一小部分知识），也不适用于内存和计算资源有限的边缘设备。

Method: 采用内存增强架构和预训练策略，引入小型语言模型访问大型分层参数化内存库。在预训练和推理时提取小的上下文相关内存块并添加到模型中，让预训练学习将长尾世界知识存储在内存参数中，而小型语言模型作为锚点捕捉通用知识和推理能力。

Result: 通过万亿token规模的实验，160M参数模型增强18M参数内存（从4.6B内存库提取）获得了与参数超过2倍的常规模型相当的性能。实验将参数化内存扩展到超过21B参数，发现分层前馈内存在不同transformer架构中都能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 提出的内存增强架构有效解决了模型参数扩展的局限性，使小型模型能够通过访问大型知识库获得与更大模型相当的性能，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on
scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better.
Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a
fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited
inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a
memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing
hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large
hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During
pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and
add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge
in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor
capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through
trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters
model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank
obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the
parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size
of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We
find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across
transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

Conclusion: 该方法为多LLM系统中的响应选择提供了一种原则性、新颖且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet
selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge,
particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend
on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques
that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems
produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater
potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We
propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the
best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood
score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these
models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across
both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with
multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets

Motivation: 现有RAG系统主要依赖非结构化文档，而忽略了关系数据库提供的精确、及时且高效查询的事实信息。数据库和文档在不同查询中具有互补优势，需要智能选择最适合的知识源。

Conclusion: 规则驱动的路由框架能有效利用数据库和文档的互补优势，通过智能选择知识源来提升问答系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general
Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios
where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external
knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while
largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and
efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable
infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research.
Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three
central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths
across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost
without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source
for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further
observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with
retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by
systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we
propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate
augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a
rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to
maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing
decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost.
Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher
accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Result: 实验揭示了知识传播、可塑性缩放、一致性和鲁棒性等方面的细微洞察，发现LLMs在不同知识层次上的更新方式与人类不同，存在一致性-容量权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更可靠和可扩展的知识更新策略提供了建议，有助于理解大语言模型的知识更新机制。

Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large
language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating
mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and
small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying
certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data
increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to
systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing
and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we
propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions
across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of
how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.
Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,
plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show
that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of
knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our
findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable
strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统化框架，通过数据库级别的结构化领域语句来提升LLM将自然语言查询转换为SQL的性能，使用子字符串匹配检索相关领域语句。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖不现实的、针对特定查询的文本提示来表达领域知识，而自然语言查询通常使用领域特定词汇，需要理解这些词汇与数据库模式结构的关系。

Method: 提出系统化框架，在数据库级别关联结构化领域语句，使用子字符串匹配方法检索与用户查询相关的领域语句。

Result: 在11个现实数据库模式上评估，显示数据库级别的结构化领域语句比现有特定查询文本提示更实用准确，子字符串匹配检索方法比其他检索方法准确率显著更高。

Conclusion: 数据库级别的结构化领域语句结合子字符串匹配检索方法能有效提升LLM在自然语言到SQL转换任务中的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural
Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL
queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping
these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain
expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks
rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating
structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of
relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level
match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains
across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level
structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing
ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match
based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher
accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

TL;DR: 通过简单的提示工程，可以在纯文本训练的LLMs中可靠地激活与视觉和听觉相关的表征，使其与专业视觉和音频编码器的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试纯文本训练的LLMs是否包含隐含的多模态规律，以及通过显式的感官提示是否能激活这些潜在结构。

Method: 使用感官提示（如'看'或'听'）来引导模型，使其在生成下一个标记时，仿佛基于潜在的视觉或听觉证据进行预测。

Result: 研究发现，轻量级的提示工程可以可靠地激活纯文本训练LLMs中与模态相适应的表征。

Conclusion: 纯文本训练的LLMs内部表征隐含地受到语言中编码的多模态规律的影响，通过适当的提示可以显式地激活这些模态特定的表征。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any
direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly
shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis
that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a
text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and
audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it
cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were
conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually
supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably
activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Abstract: We present CLARITY (Clinical Assistant for Routing, Inference, and Triage),
an AI-driven platform designed to facilitate patient-to-specialist routing,
clinical consultations, and severity assessment of patients' conditions. Its
hybrid architecture combines a Finite State Machine (FSM) for structured
dialogue flows with collaborative agents that employ Large Language Model (LLM)
to analyze symptoms and prioritize referrals to appropriate specialists. Built
on a modular microservices framework, CLARITY ensures safe, efficient, and
robust performance, flexible and readily scalable to meet the demands of
existing workflows and IT solutions in healthcare.
  We report integration of our clinical assistant into a large-scale
nation-wide inter-hospital IT platform, with over 55,000 content-rich user
dialogues completed within the two months of deployment, 2,500 of which were
expert-annotated for a consequent validation. The validation results show that
CLARITY surpasses human-level performance in terms of the first-attempt routing
precision, naturally requiring up to 3 times shorter duration of the
consultation than with a human.

*Laura Ying Schulz,Daniel Mitropolsky,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于概率上下文无关文法(PCFGs)的新框架来研究语言模型如何学习语法，发现transformer模型与人类儿童学习语法的方式不同，会并行学习所有子语法结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型取得了显著成果，但对其学习动态知之甚少。本文旨在通过PCFGs这一通用框架来理解语言模型如何获取语法知识。

Method: 使用PCFGs生成合成语言训练小型模型，精确控制语法复杂性、递归深度和子语法结构，并推导训练损失和KL散度的递归公式。

Result: 发现transformer模型并行学习所有子语法结构，子语法预训练可改善小模型的最终损失，预训练模型内部表示与语法子结构更一致，但模型在处理深层递归结构时存在困难。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了在PCFGs上研究transformer学习动态的新方向，作为探测语言模型学习的通用测试平台，揭示了神经网络在表示层次语法方面的基本挑战。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire
syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about
their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most
domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages,
arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic
languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar
complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several
general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler
divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that
unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to
more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in
parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final
loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal
representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we
demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation
even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural
networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study
of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for
probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many
open questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cobweb框架通过构建层次化原型树实现文档检索，提供多粒度相关性信号和可解释的检索路径，在保持竞争力的同时增强了嵌入质量的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经文档检索将语料库视为扁平向量空间，忽略了语料库结构且缺乏解释性，需要利用层次结构来改进检索效果和透明度。

Method: 使用Cobweb框架将句子嵌入组织成原型树，通过粗到细的遍历方式对文档进行排序。内部节点作为概念原型，提供多粒度相关性信号。实现了两种推理方法：广义最佳优先搜索和轻量级路径求和排序器。

Result: 在MS MARCO和QQP数据集上的实验表明，该方法在强编码器嵌入上与点积搜索性能相当，但在GPT-2向量上点积搜索性能崩溃时仍能保持稳健，检索相关结果。

Conclusion: Cobweb框架提供了竞争力的检索效果、对嵌入质量的改进鲁棒性、可扩展性以及通过层次化原型的可解释检索。

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors
scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and
explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize
sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine
traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular
relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We
instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a
lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP
with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results
show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong
encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2
vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still
retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb
provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality,
scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标难以有效捕捉现代LLM生成内容的关键特征，特别是在高流畅性和自然性方面存在局限，因此需要更全面的RAG系统评估方法。

Method: 扩展RAGAS框架为基于知识图谱的评估范式，引入多跳推理和语义社区聚类技术，构建更全面的评分指标。

Result: 与RAGAS评分相比，该方法与人工标注结果相关性更高，且对生成输出中的细微语义差异更加敏感。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的评估方法为RAG系统提供了更深入的理解和更细致的性能视角，同时指出了RAG系统评估的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is
utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of
the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),
which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However,
evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation
metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern
LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness.
Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended
this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop
reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive
scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we
gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on
their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare
its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to
assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In
addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based
evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated
outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and
highlight potential directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语音语言模型中模态适配器如何将语音编码器输出转换为语言模型可理解的表示，因为目前对这些关键组件的工作原理知之甚少。

Method: 通过计算模态适配器输出表示与解码器语言模型token之间的最近邻距离，分析三种语音语言模型的表示策略。

Result: 发现两种策略：使用Whisper编码器的模型创建英语中间语表示语义，能处理未见语言；其他模型用英语词汇表示语音音素。

Conclusion: 模态适配器的表示策略取决于语音编码器的训练目标——仅语音识别或包含翻译任务。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language
models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech
encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we
know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we
examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and
Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA
representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models
using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using
an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in
instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs
instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.
We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is
trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于上下文归因的金标准高亮解释评估框架，评估了四种高亮解释方法在上下文利用方面的准确性，发现MechLight表现最佳但所有方法在长上下文和位置偏差方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型如何利用上下文信息对用户来说是不透明的，无法确定模型是从参数记忆还是提供的上下文中获取信息，也无法识别哪些具体的上下文片段影响了响应。高亮解释可以指出影响模型输出的确切上下文片段和标记，但缺乏对其准确性的评估。

Method: 引入首个用于上下文归因的金标准高亮解释评估框架，使用已知真实上下文使用情况的受控测试案例。评估了四种高亮解释方法（包括三种现有技术和我们为此任务调整的机制可解释性方法MechLight），涵盖四种上下文场景、四个数据集和五个语言模型。

Result: MechLight在所有上下文场景中表现最佳。但所有方法在处理较长上下文时都遇到困难，并表现出位置偏差，这表明在解释准确性方面存在基本挑战。

Conclusion: 需要新的方法来提供可靠的大规模上下文利用解释，当前的高亮解释方法在准确解释上下文利用方面仍面临根本性挑战。

Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate
relevant information from the provided context when generating responses,
remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from
parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context
pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural
solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced
model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in
accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing
the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using
controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the
limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the
framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three
established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach
we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and
five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context
scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit
positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy
that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation
explanations at scale.

TL;DR: 用户与LLM聊天机器人和人类代理的沟通风格存在显著差异，包括语法流畅性、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。为增强LLM对部署后沟通风格变化的鲁棒性，数据增强策略比推理时消息重构更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在客户服务中的广泛应用，需要了解用户与聊天机器人和人类代理的沟通差异，以改进模型训练和用户体验。

Method: 通过实证分析用户语言特征，并测试两种策略：后训练阶段的数据增强和推理时用户消息重构。

Result: 用户在与聊天机器人交互时表现出不同的语法流畅性、礼貌程度和词汇多样性。使用风格多样化数据集训练的模型表现优于仅使用原始或风格统一数据集的模型。

Conclusion: LLM需要适应部署后用户沟通风格的变化，数据增强是提高模型鲁棒性的有效方法，有助于改善LLM-用户交互体验。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing
applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate
differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we
present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when
users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals
significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical
diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest
that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not
adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM
chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication
style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation
during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message
reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically
diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original
or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved
less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved
LLM-user interaction experiences.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上取得进展，但由于资源限制，推理能力未能成功迁移到非高资源语言，导致多语言推理任务表现不佳。

Method: SoT方法通过语言思维转换和结构化知识转换两个步骤，将语言特定语义信息转换为语言无关的结构化表示，引导LLMs进行更集中的推理。

Conclusion: SoT方法有效提升了多语言推理性能，通过结构化表示解决了跨语言表达变异的挑战，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in
complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of
reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages
due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method
that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step
transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge
Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information
into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to
understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT
effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain
consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations
in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several
strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to
various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free
strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in self-improvement for Large Language Models (LLMs) have
efficiently enhanced model capabilities without significantly increasing costs,
particularly in terms of human effort. While this area is still relatively
young, its extension to the multimodal domain holds immense potential for
leveraging diverse data sources and developing more general self-improving
models. This survey is the first to provide a comprehensive overview of
self-improvement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We provide a structured overview
of the current literature and discuss methods from three perspectives: 1) data
collection, 2) data organization, and 3) model optimization, to facilitate the
further development of self-improvement in MLLMs. We also include commonly used
evaluations and downstream applications. Finally, we conclude by outlining open
challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book
factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored,
despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ
for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to
quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic,
token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the
predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution.
By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate
the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive
an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as
semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to
the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA
task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance
(using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context
comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty
(avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we
extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and
ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA
benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that
our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
(sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a
13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注静态基准和单轮评估，无法捕捉真实对话中随时间变化的退化动态，需要新的方法来理解LLM在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用生存分析框架，包括Cox比例风险模型、加速失效时间模型和随机生存森林方法，分析了9个最先进LLM的36,951个对话轮次。

Result: AFT模型表现最佳，具有优异的区分度和校准能力。突发性语义漂移会灾难性地增加对话失败风险，而渐进性语义漂移则能显著降低失败风险并延长对话持续时间。

Conclusion: 生存分析是评估LLM鲁棒性的强大范式，为设计弹性对话代理提供了具体见解，并挑战了对话AI系统中语义一致性的必要性假设。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their
robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing
evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments,
failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that
characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing
36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a
time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox
proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest
approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt,
prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing
the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative
drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling
significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate
superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional
calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm
for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient
conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity
of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Method: 使用来自真实场景的匿名数据，策划了14个旅游领域数据集，涵盖7个常见NLP任务，并分析了LLM在这些任务中的表现。

Result: 通用基准测试结果不足以理解模型在低资源任务中的性能。尽管训练FLOPs数量不同，现成的LLM在复杂、特定领域场景中仍会遇到性能瓶颈。推理能力对较小LLM提升更显著，使其在某些任务中成为更好的判断者。

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model

real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on
the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a
variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are
insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite
the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks
in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more
significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on
certain tasks.

*KM Pooja,Cheng Long,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于策略梯度的生成对抗网络PGMEL，用于多模态实体链接任务，通过生成高质量负样本来提升表示学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态实体链接方法未充分探索高质量负样本选择的重要性，这可能在度量学习中发挥关键作用

Method: 在生成对抗框架下解决多模态实体链接问题：生成器负责生成高质量负样本，判别器负责度量学习任务；使用策略梯度技术优化生成器

Result: 在Wiki-MEL、Richpedia-MEL和WikiDiverse数据集上的实验结果表明，PGMEL通过选择具有挑战性的负样本来学习有意义的表示，并优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: PGMEL方法成功填补了多模态实体链接中负样本选择研究的空白，证明了生成对抗框架在该任务中的有效性

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their
respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention
due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity
linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive
embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of
high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in
metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this
possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of
MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a
generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for
generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the
responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved
in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy
gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial
network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on
Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns
meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于对比学习编码器的评估框架和IndiCASA数据集，评估印度语境下LLMs的刻板印象偏见，发现所有模型都存在偏见，特别是残疾相关偏见最持久。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在关键领域应用增加，需要评估其嵌入偏见，特别是在印度等文化多元语境中，现有基于嵌入的偏见评估方法难以捕捉细微刻板印象。

Method: 使用对比学习训练的编码器通过嵌入相似性捕捉细粒度偏见，并创建包含2,575条人工验证句子的IndiCASA数据集，涵盖种姓、性别、宗教、残疾和社会经济地位五个维度。

Result: 评估多个开源LLMs发现所有模型都表现出不同程度的刻板印象偏见，残疾相关偏见特别持久，宗教偏见相对较低可能因全球去偏见努力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了需要更公平的模型开发，特别是在文化多元语境中评估和减轻偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical
domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative
capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications
necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally
diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment
methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an
evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that
captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a
novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and
Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five
demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic
status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models
exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being
notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global
debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自感知强化学习方法，通过让LLM自己生成任务并尝试解决，结合难度预测和极限突破机制，用极少数据显著提升模型推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL训练需要大量标注数据，成本高昂。本研究旨在探索如何用最少数据通过RL提升LLM的推理能力

Method: 交替进行任务生成与解决，引入自感知难度预测（评估任务难度并优先挑战可解任务）和自感知极限突破（识别能力边界并主动请求外部数据）

Result: 在9个基准测试中实现了53.8%的相对提升，仅使用不到1.2%的额外数据

Conclusion: 自感知RL方法有效，展示了自进化智能体训练的前景

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training
typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this
work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach
alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To
minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in
self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to
assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging
yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model
recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively
requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on
nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra
data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of
self-evolving agent training.

TL;DR: XTRA是一个跨语言主题建模框架，通过表示对齐和主题对齐的双重机制，在共享语义空间中实现跨语言主题的一致性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言主题建模方法在主题多样性方面有所改进，但难以同时保证主题连贯性和跨语言对齐一致性。

Method: XTRA结合词袋模型和多语言嵌入，使用表示对齐（通过对比学习对齐文档-主题分布）和主题对齐（将主题-词分布投影到共享空间）的双重机制。

Result: 在多语言语料库上的实验表明，XTRA在主题连贯性、多样性和对齐质量方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XTRA框架能够学习到既具有可解释性（连贯且多样）又能在不同语言间良好对齐的主题。

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across
languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem,
leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have
achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure
high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA
(Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a
novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual
embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment,
aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared
semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions
into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism
enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and
well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that
XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity,
and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人格评估中大型标注数据集稀缺以及人格心理学与自然语言处理领域脱节的问题，这些限制影响了模型的有效性和可解释性。

Method: 从Reddit收集数据构建MBTI9k和PANDORA数据集，开发SIMPA框架使用机器学习和语义相似度匹配用户语句与问卷项目。

Result: 实验显示人口统计变量影响模型有效性，SIMPA框架能够提供与人类评估相当的人格评估结果，同时保持高可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: SIMPA框架不仅适用于人格评估，其模型无关设计、分层线索检测和可扩展性使其适用于涉及复杂标签分类法和变量线索关联的各种应用。

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and
feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from
social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become
increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis
of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main
challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,
personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology
and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these
challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --
collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse
discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000
users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic
information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.
Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model
validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality
Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for
interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements
with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic
similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human
evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although
focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this
domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make
it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex
label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StepChain GraphRAG框架通过结合问题分解和广度优先搜索推理流程，提升了多跳问答的准确性和可解释性，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在整合迭代推理步骤与外部知识检索方面仍面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来处理复杂多跳问题。

Method: 首先构建全局索引，在推理时仅将检索到的段落动态解析为知识图谱，将复杂查询分解为子问题，然后对每个子问题使用基于BFS的遍历动态扩展相关边，构建显式证据链。

Result: 在MuSiQue、2WikiMultiHopQA和HotpotQA数据集上实现了最先进的精确匹配和F1分数，平均EM提升2.57%，F1提升2.13%，在HotpotQA上获得最大增益（+4.70% EM，+3.44% F1）。

Conclusion: StepChain GraphRAG通过保留中间检索步骤的思维链增强了可解释性，未来工作需要减轻计算开销并解决大语言模型的潜在幻觉问题，以提升多跳问答的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more
accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges
persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge
retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that
unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow
for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the
corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a
knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each
sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges,
assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model
with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA
show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1
scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the
SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1).
StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the
chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing
how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential
hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability
in multi-hop QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在生物多样性保护中的快速应用，需要系统评估其在物种评估中的可靠性，以确定其应用边界。

Method: 对5个领先的大语言模型在21,955个物种上进行系统验证，涵盖IUCN红色名录的四个核心评估组件：分类学、保护状态、分布和威胁。

Result: 模型在分类学分类上表现出色(94.9%)，但在保护状态评估等推理任务上表现较差(27.2%)，且存在对魅力脊椎动物的系统性偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是强大的信息检索工具，但在基于判断的决策中需要人类监督。建议采用混合方法，让LLMs增强专家能力，而人类专家保留风险评估和政策的最终权威。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to
address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation
is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955
species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy,
conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was
revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently
failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This
knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent
architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models
exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially
amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear
boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for
information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions.
A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while
human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Wordle求解器依赖信息论熵最大化或基于频率的启发式方法，缺乏正式的约束处理，需要建立全面的CSP建模和约束感知求解策略。

Method: 引入CSP感知熵（在约束传播后计算信息增益而非原始候选集）和概率CSP框架（将贝叶斯词频先验与逻辑约束结合），通过约束恢复机制处理噪声。

Result: CSP感知熵在2,315个英语单词上实现3.54平均猜测次数和99.9%成功率，比前向检查提升1.7%，运行时间快46%。在10%噪声下保持5.3个百分点优势，概率CSP在所有噪声水平（0-20%）实现100%成功率。西班牙语验证显示88%成功率且无需语言特定调优。

Conclusion: 正式CSP处理、约束感知启发式、概率-逻辑集成、鲁棒性分析和跨词典验证的组合为结构化谜题求解领域建立了新的性能基准，证明原则性约束满足技术优于经典信息论和基于学习的方法。

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic
entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint
treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with
novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy,
computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw
candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian
word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315
English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9%
success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward
Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms
versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3
percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic
CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint
recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates
88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP
principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from
linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source
implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides
reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP
treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration,
robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance
benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques
outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for
structured puzzle-solving domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自反射机制要么对整个草稿进行修订，要么通过昂贵训练学习自校正，都是被动且低效的。需要一种在生成过程中主动进行反射的方法。

Method: 在token生成过程中，利用动态熵阈值识别高不确定性token，为每个识别出的token训练特定的纠正向量，利用已生成上下文进行自反射生成来修正token概率分布。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，SRGen显著提升模型推理能力，在AIME2024上使DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B的Pass@1提升12.0%，Cons@5提升13.3%。

Conclusion: SRGen是一个即插即用方法，将反射集成到生成过程中，实现可靠的LLM推理，以有限开销获得一致增益，并能与其他训练时和测试时技术组合使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via
long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process
is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for
self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs
revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,
both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose
Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time
framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token
generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify
high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific
corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a
self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By
retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more
trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors
at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model
reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger
self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on
Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a
plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for
reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and
broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g.,
SLOT) techniques.

Motivation: 现有成员推断攻击和数据集推断方法需要访问内部信号，而当前黑盒方法依赖人工设计的提示或干净的参考数据集，限制了实际应用。水印技术虽然可行，但会降低文本质量或任务性能。

Method: TRACE使用私钥指导的无失真水印重写数据集，在检测时利用微调对水印数据的放射性效应，引入基于熵的门控程序选择性评分高不确定性token，显著增强检测能力。

Result: 在多样化数据集和模型家族中，TRACE始终实现显著检测(p<0.05)，通常具有极强的统计证据。支持多数据集归因，即使在大规模非水印语料库上继续预训练后仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRACE为可靠的黑盒验证受版权保护数据集使用提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller,
domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets
often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for
reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference
attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to
internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely
on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of
which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative,
but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We
propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of
copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets
with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text
quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity
effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated
procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially
amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE
consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely
strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution
and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked
corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable
black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code
available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于RAG的系统，用于查询英国NICE临床指南，该系统通过混合嵌入机制实现高精度检索，显著提升了LLM在医疗问答中的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICE临床指南篇幅长、数量多，在时间紧迫的医疗系统中难以有效利用，需要一种能够快速提供精确信息的自然语言查询系统。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)架构，结合混合嵌入机制，从10,195个文本块中检索相关信息，使用LLM生成答案。

Result: 系统在7,901个查询上表现优异：MRR为0.814，首块召回率81%，前10块召回率99.1%。RAG增强模型在忠实度上提升64.7个百分点至99.5%，显著优于医疗专用模型Meditron3-8B(43%)。

Conclusion: RAG被证明是医疗领域应用生成式AI的有效、可靠且可扩展的方法，能够经济高效地访问医疗指南。

Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language
Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede
their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this
project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users
with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The
system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was
evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred
guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten
retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the
generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy
question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in
performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the
source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the
RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused
Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context
Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability
to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source
material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and
scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling
cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer
interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of
emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive
semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive
semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching
emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants
describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each
clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal
scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with
intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions.
Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way

### [123] [Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better Scaling than CoT Prompting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03093)
*Oriol Pareras,Gerard I. Gállego,Federico Costa,Cristina España-Bonet,Javier Hernando*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了在语音到文本翻译任务中，随着数据量增加，直接提示与思维链提示的性能变化，发现直接提示方法在更多数据下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到文本翻译研究主要采用基于大语言模型的思维链提示方法，但需要系统评估随着S2TT数据量增加，直接提示与思维链提示的相对效果变化。

Method: 通过将ASR语料库的转录文本翻译成六种欧洲语言来创建伪标签数据，在不同数据规模下训练基于LLM的S2TT系统，比较直接提示和思维链提示策略。

Result: 结果显示，随着数据量增加，直接提示方法的改进更加一致，表明在创建更大S2TT资源时，直接提示可能成为更有效的方法。

Conclusion: 随着语音到文本翻译数据资源的扩大，直接提示策略可能比当前主流的思维链提示更具优势。

Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based
models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it.
CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit
abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT)
datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically
compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this
end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six
European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting
strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more
consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a
more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告评估对放射科医生培训至关重要，但现有大型语言模型在专业医学领域应用面临挑战，需要专门领域知识。

Method: 提出Llama-EntScore方法，结合Llama 3.1和NER，通过可调权重来强调或弱化特定类型的差异，生成定量相似性评分和解释性反馈。

Result: 该方法达到67%的精确匹配准确率和93%的±1范围内准确率，优于单独使用LLM或NER的方法。

Conclusion: Llama-EntScore能够有效比较放射学报告的语义差异，为初级医生提供有价值的培训指导，在放射学报告评估中表现出色。

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and
plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard
reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary
report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce
the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and
final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to
help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly
growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we
explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of
reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of
several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional
approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches
exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To
address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method
using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or
de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a
quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an
interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing
and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match
accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided
ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently. Code

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoT prompting在语音转文本翻译中主要依赖转录文本而非语音信号，未能充分利用声学信息，其表现与级联系统相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ASR+T2TT级联系统的错误传播问题和无法利用韵律等声学线索的局限性。

Method: 通过归因方法分析CoT提示、使用损坏转录进行鲁棒性评估、以及韵律感知分析，并引入直接S2TT数据和噪声转录注入等训练干预。

Result: CoT主要依赖转录文本，很少利用语音信号；训练干预可增强鲁棒性并提高语音归因。

Conclusion: CoT的假设优势受到挑战，需要能显式整合声学信息的架构。

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major
limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other
acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced,
with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will
overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness
evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it
largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely
leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT
data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech
attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and
highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic
information into translation.

TL;DR: 提出了SurveyBench评估框架，通过细粒度的测验驱动方法评估自动生成的学术综述质量，发现现有LLM4Survey方法比人类表现平均低21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成学术综述的方法输出质量达不到人类标准，且缺乏严格、与读者需求对齐的评估基准来揭示其不足。

Method: 构建SurveyBench框架：从11,343篇arXiv论文和4,947篇高质量综述中选取主题；建立多维度指标层次评估大纲质量、内容质量和非文本丰富度；采用基于内容和测验的双模式评估协议。

Result: SurveyBench有效挑战了现有LLM4Survey方法，在基于内容的评估中平均比人类表现低21%。

Conclusion: SurveyBench填补了学术综述自动生成评估的空白，为改进LLM4Survey方法提供了严格的基准。

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and
insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding
task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and
survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a.
LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks
a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their
deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven
evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source
from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys;
(2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g.,
coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis
granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a
dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based
answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs.
Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches
(e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型的置信度校准对可靠部署至关重要，但在多语言环境中这一关键特性尚未得到充分探索，需要研究多语言校准问题。

Method: 研究了6个模型家族和100多种语言，分析内部表示，发现最终层存在英语中心偏差，提出基于中间层的语言感知置信度集成方法LACE。

Result: 发现非英语语言校准明显更差，中间层提供更可靠的校准信号，LACE方法能有效提升多语言校准性能。

Conclusion: 英语中心对齐存在隐藏成本，通过超越最终层的方法可以构建更公平可信的多语言大模型。

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with
its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored
in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,
systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and
over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from
systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's
internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by
English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.
In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that
late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and
better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of
training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),
which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific
language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment
and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy
LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

TL;DR: 论文提出EditLens模型，能够检测AI编辑的文本，并量化AI编辑的程度，在二元和三元分类任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检测完全AI生成的文本，但大量查询要求LLM编辑用户提供的文本，因此需要检测AI编辑的文本。

Method: 首先使用轻量级相似性指标量化AI编辑程度，然后用这些指标作为中间监督训练EditLens回归模型来预测AI编辑量。

Result: 模型在二元分类任务中F1=94.7%，三元分类任务中F1=90.4%，并成功应用于分析Grammarly等写作辅助工具的AI编辑效果。

Conclusion: AI编辑的文本可以被检测，且AI对人类写作的修改程度也可以被检测，这对作者归属、教育和政策有重要意义。

Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit
user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous
work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that
AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text.
First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the
magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text
and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity
metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model
that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary
(F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.
Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the
degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has
implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a
case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by
Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we
commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Motivation: 检验先前关于大语言模型隐藏状态与大脑fMRI响应相关性的研究结果是否稳健，排除维度灾难等潜在问题的影响。

Method: 通过多种验证方法：维度降维分析、新的相似性度量方法、比较不同训练类型的模型、以及检查位置编码的影响。

Result: 先前结果在降维后依然显著，对新相似性度量方法有效，相关性仅存在于人类语言训练的模型中，且依赖于位置编码的存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果确认并加强了先前研究的发现，为大语言模型的生物学合理性和可解释性提供了更强支持。

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large
language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations
have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models
and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to
several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous
results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not
attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are
confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations
between brain representations and those from models are specific to models
trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the
presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and
strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the
biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language
models.

Motivation: 探索在大语言模型时代下主题建模的新范式，验证是否多数神经主题模型已经过时，以及LLM能否通过零样本提示超越传统方法。

Method: 提出简单的实用方法：采样数据子集、使用特定提示生成主题和代表性文本、通过关键词匹配进行文本分配，并与神经主题模型进行系统性比较。

Result: 论文通过实证研究比较了LLM和NTMs在主题质量方面的表现，检验了"多数NTMs已过时"的说法。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLM在主题建模任务中的潜力，为传统主题建模方法提供了新的替代方案。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and
generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a
new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM
as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We
propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model
tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative
text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate
whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot
prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of
topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are
outdated."

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨语言迁移方法在缺乏目标语言数据时依赖语言级别特征，需要一种能够利用无标注目标数据来更准确排序源语言的方法。

Method: 使用多语言模型的隐藏表示和无标注目标语言数据，通过计算源语言和目标语言表示之间的相似度来排序源语言。

Result: 在词性标注任务上平均提升35.56 NDCG，命名实体识别任务上平均提升18.14 NDCG。即使仅使用25个无标注样本，也能达到使用全部数据时92.8%的排名质量。

Conclusion: NN-Rank能够有效利用少量无标注目标数据生成高质量的源语言排序，在跨语言迁移任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for
cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from
multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two
pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and
named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on
56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain
data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and
linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and
18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level
features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains
competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large
number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show
that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces
high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all
available target data for ranking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Web代理处理冗长网页时面临上下文限制饱和、计算成本高和安全风险（如提示注入）等问题，现有修剪策略要么丢弃相关内容，要么保留无关上下文。

Method: 利用轻量级LLM检索器从可访问性树观察中提取最相关行，基于任务目标进行指导，修剪噪声和无关内容。

Result: 在WorkArena和WebArena基准测试中，FocusAgent性能与强基线相当，同时将观察大小减少50%以上，其变体显著降低了提示注入攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的针对性检索是构建高效、有效且安全的Web代理的实用且稳健策略。

Abstract: Web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) must process lengthy web
page observations to complete user goals; these pages often exceed tens of
thousands of tokens. This saturates context limits and increases computational
cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security
risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard
relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action
prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that
leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from
accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning
noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while
reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and
WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong
baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant
of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection
attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success
performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted
LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents
that are efficient, effective, and secure.

TL;DR: 提出Cache-to-Cache（C2C）新范式，通过直接KV缓存通信实现多LLM系统间的语义传输，避免文本转换损失，提升性能并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多LLM系统通过文本通信会丢失丰富的语义信息并产生逐token生成的延迟，需要探索超越文本的通信方式。

Method: 使用神经网络将源模型的KV缓存投影并融合到目标模型的KV缓存中，实现直接语义传输，并通过可学习门控机制选择受益于缓存通信的目标层。

Result: C2C比单个模型平均准确率提高8.5-10.5%，比文本通信范式提升约3.0-5.0%，同时延迟平均加速2.0倍。

Conclusion: KV缓存是有效的模型间通信媒介，C2C范式能够充分利用模型的专业语义知识，避免中间文本生成，实现更高效的多模型协作。

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large
Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a
single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing
internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This
process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token
generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs
communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache
semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,
supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,
we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic
communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the
source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic
transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit
from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the
deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit
intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5%
higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text
communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average
2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理链的延长，关键中间步骤和原始提示会被淹没在上下文中，导致注意力不足和错误。需要一种方法来引导LLM在长推理过程中保持对关键步骤的关注。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为结构化计划，自动对齐模型注意力到最相关的推理步骤，使模型在整个生成过程中保持专注。

Result: 在六个基准测试中超越最先进的提示方法，显著缩小了"非推理"模型与专门推理模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: Self-Anchor有潜力使大多数LLM无需重新训练就能处理复杂推理任务，为轻量级推理解决方案提供了新途径。

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs),
prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical
intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context,
receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we
propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of
reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories
into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the
most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout
generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting
methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the
performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning
models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning
tasks without retraining.

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language
models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess
the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is
also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI
model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to
redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include
susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking,
methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our
position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help
overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward
models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas.
Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer
alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference
elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and
calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于对扩散ODE和SDE截断误差的分析，旨在开发无需额外训练的高效采样算法，解决扩散模型生成速度慢的问题。

Method: 通过分析扩散ODE和SDE的截断误差，设计训练自由的采样算法，支持灵活引导尺度，实现快速高质量图像生成。

Result: 在8步内生成512×512图像，FID性能优于DPM++ 2m（20步）和AMED-plugin；在8步内生成1024×1024图像，性能接近最新蒸馏模型；5步推理性能与SDXL-turbo（4步）和Flash Diffusion（5步）相当。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在无需额外训练的情况下，实现了高效的扩散模型采样，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能，为快速高质量图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that generates an
image by applying a neural network iteratively. Moreover, this generation
process is regarded as an algorithm solving an ordinary differential equation
or a stochastic differential equation. Based on the analysis of the truncation
error of the diffusion ODE and SDE, our study proposes a training-free
algorithm that generates high-quality 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 images in eight
steps, with flexible guidance scales. To the best of my knowledge, our
algorithm is the first one that samples a 1024 x 1024 resolution image in 8
steps with an FID performance comparable to that of the latest distillation
model, but without additional training. Meanwhile, our algorithm can also
generate a 512 x 512 image in 8 steps, and its FID performance is better than
the inference result using state-of-the-art ODE solver DPM++ 2m in 20 steps. We
validate our eight-step image generation algorithm using the COCO 2014, COCO
2017, and LAION datasets. And our best FID performance is 15.7, 22.35, and
17.52. While the FID performance of DPM++2m is 17.3, 23.75, and 17.33. Further,
it also outperforms the state-of-the-art AMED-plugin solver, whose FID
performance is 19.07, 25.50, and 18.06. We also apply the algorithm in
five-step inference without additional training, for which the best FID
performance in the datasets mentioned above is 19.18, 23.24, and 19.61,
respectively, and is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art AMED
Pulgin solver in eight steps, SDXL-turbo in four steps, and the
state-of-the-art diffusion distillation model Flash Diffusion in five steps. We
also validate our algorithm in synthesizing 1024 * 1024 images within 6 steps,
whose FID performance only has a limited distance to the latest distillation

Abstract: The visualization of 3D point cloud data is essential in fields such as
autonomous navigation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response, where
tasks like object recognition, structural analysis, and spatiotemporal
exploration rely on clear and effective visual representation. Despite
advancements in AI-driven processing, visualization remains a critical tool for
interpreting complex spatial datasets. However, designing effective point cloud
visualizations presents significant challenges due to the sparsity, density
variations, and scale of the data. In this work, we analyze the design space of
spatial point cloud visualization, highlighting a gap in systematically mapping
visualization techniques to analytical objectives. We introduce a taxonomy that
categorizes four decades of visualization design choices, linking them to
fundamental challenges in modern applications. By structuring visualization
strategies based on data types, user objectives, and visualization techniques,
our framework provides a foundation for advancing more effective,
interpretable, and user-centered visualization techniques.

Abstract: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications,
including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.
However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous

construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update.
We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.

### [139] [Extreme value forecasting using relevance-based data augmentation with deep learning models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02407)
*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步超前预测，旨在提高极值区域的预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。本研究旨在通过数据增强技术改善极值预测的准确性。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步超前预测，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，并提出了基于相关函数的极值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中均表现出更好的适应性。Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现优异，而BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据增强技术能有效提升极值预测性能，不同模型在不同类型数据中具有互补优势，SMOTE方法在极值预测中表现出色。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型家族，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，解决了LLMs无法处理时间序列的局限性。该研究提出了两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多模态数据处理方面表现出色，但在医疗领域面临无法处理时间序列数据的重大限制。为了克服这一差距，需要开发能够原生理解时间序列的模型，以合成大量临床信息为可操作的洞察。

Method: 提出了两种OpenTSLM架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列token与文本token连接进行隐式建模；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力机制将时间序列与文本集成进行显式建模。在三个时间序列推理数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务上都优于基线方法，在睡眠分期任务中达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务中达到65.4 F1，而仅文本微调模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o的性能（15.47和2.95）。Flamingo版本在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了时间序列推理能力。显式建模方法在性能和内存效率方面优于隐式方法。该研究为医疗时间序列分析提供了有效的解决方案，所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段物理信息架构解决雷达数据到地面降雨的转换问题，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑关键结构，无法捕捉急剧变化和局地极端值，这影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物下降过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集RAIN-F和MeteoNet上评估，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法持续改进，MAE降低超过13.31%，并显著提高了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理基础的结构先验，成功解决了高分辨率降雨场重建中的结构保真问题，为洪水预报和水文建模提供了更准确的数据基础。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

### [142] [How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)
*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models是一种轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型进行动态的自然语言指令引导，相比静态提示优化有更好的适应性和性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，只能通过提示进行定制。静态提示优化产生的固定提示无法适应不同输入、用户或环境的变化。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在上下文中对黑盒模型发出自然语言引导指令。该顾问模型位于输入和模型之间，根据环境奖励信号对每个实例进行行为塑造。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域中，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。同时展示了顾问模型在黑盒模型间的可迁移性，以及在保持对分布外输入鲁棒性的同时实现专业化的能力。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，顾问充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models对黑盒模型进行动态优化是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

### [143] [Market-Based Data Subset Selection -- Principled Aggregation of Multi-Criteria Example Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02456)
*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），使用单一流动性参数控制集中度，在固定计算预算下实现多信号数据筛选的统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种效用信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），权重设置随意，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过价格-每令牌规则处理令牌预算，加入轻量级多样性头提高覆盖度。

Result: 在GSM8K（60k令牌预算）上，市场方法达到与强基线相当的性能，同时降低种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上保持5-25%数据时，提供竞争性准确率并改善平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明可控的聚合机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PTQ在推理过程中可能因输入分布变化导致的严重性能下降，特别是在安全关键部署环境中，需要了解潜在的性能降低程度和导致这种降低的输入分布特征。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和比特宽度策略对，分析量化下的灾难性故障，重点关注最坏情况下的潜在性能损失。

Result: 发现了存在"有害"的网络-策略对，多个实例显示准确率下降10-65%，而"鲁棒"对应物仅下降<2%。通过系统实验和分析，初步探索了最高脆弱点。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在现实世界部署场景中需要谨慎，鼓励对鲁棒性进行更严格的检查，并在深度学习领域更重视安全考虑。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Motivation: 在大数据集上训练现代神经网络计算和能耗密集，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图在O(ℓD)内存中维护梯度几何，通过两遍处理、GPU友好的流水线，消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用小的保留率预算进行训练，同时保持相对于全数据训练和最新子集选择基线的竞争性准确率，并减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一个实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于不确定性的模型选择策略，通过选择预测区间范围最小的TabPFN模型进行集成，在siRNA敲低效能预测任务中优于传统集成方法和单一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习器在生物分子效能预测中表现良好，但其性能对提供的上下文高度敏感。如何在没有真实标签的情况下选择最佳模型进行集成是一个开放性问题。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型结合简单序列特征，通过模型预测的区间范围作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成。

Result: TabPFN模型在siRNA敲低效能预测中超越了专门的先进预测器，模型的不确定性指标与真实预测误差呈负相关，基于不确定性的集成方法优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是一种强大的无标签启发式方法，可用于优化生物分子效能预测。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)方法，通过对比学习从高维观测中提取可独立控制的状态因子，解决了传统方法需要先验因子表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要已知的因子化表示，要么无法利用因子结构。ACF旨在直接从高维观测中学习可控制的状态因子，弥合这一差距。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作只影响状态变量的子集）来识别可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在三个基准测试（Taxi、FourRooms、MiniGrid-DoorKey）上，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实的可控制因子，性能优于基线解耦算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功地从高维观测中学习到了可控制的状态因子表示，为强化学习中的表示学习提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL虽然能从大数据中学习控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会急剧下降；有界ES能处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度慢且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和有界ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据快速控制多参数系统到期望设定点，有界ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过单独使用任一方法，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心线性粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究验证。

Conclusion: DRL和有界ES的组合能够产生协同效应，既保持了DRL的学习能力和快速响应特性，又获得了ES对时变系统的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

Conclusion: SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差学习框架，通过在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习来补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差，从而在有限状态设备上实现片上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算加速器使用电阻交叉阵列进行深度神经网络计算，但实际训练需要至少8位电导状态才能匹配数字基线。许多有前景的忆阻器件（如ReRAM）由于制造限制只能提供约4位分辨率，这种有限的更新精度会显著降低训练精度。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，在多块交叉阵列瓦片上顺序学习，补偿低精度权重更新的残差误差。理论分析显示最优性差距随瓦片数量减少，并实现线性收敛速率。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，该方法在有限状态设置下始终优于最先进的模拟内存训练策略，成本分析确认仅产生适度的硬件开销。

Conclusion: 所提出的残差学习框架能够有效解决有限状态忆阻器件的训练精度问题，为片上训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于谱几何和流匹配的图生成框架SFMG，通过谱嵌入将图映射到黎曼流形，并沿测地线流匹配分布来生成图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐目标图的谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地线流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，SFMG在图元、度和谱指标上与最先进方法性能相当，比基于扩散的模型快30倍，并能泛化到未见过的图规模。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在可扩展性和训练效率方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏比较模型激活与大脑响应的共识方法，需要建立更严格的比较标准来评估神经网络模型作为大脑机制模型的准确性。

Method: 使用IATC方法，通过识别动物群体中准确映射神经响应所需的最严格函数集，在模拟神经网络群体、小鼠群体和人类群体中建立双向映射。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的细节特征(如非线性激活函数)，实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时在不同脑区响应模式间实现高特异性分离。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制识别准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型提供了新证据，改进了模型-大脑比较方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Motivation: 开发能够同时处理纵向可穿戴数据的时序特征学习、结果预测和行为亚型识别的统一框架，提供临床可解释的风险分析。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习紧凑潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者数据上，聚类质量（轮廓系数0.70 vs 0.32-0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67）均优于基线；跨年验证（332名参与者）确认了聚类可重复性（轮廓系数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE在纵向睡眠数据分析中表现出色，提供了临床可解释的亚型分析和时间注意力可视化，有助于理解睡眠规律变化与抑郁风险的关系。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Motivation: 图神经网络的表达能力有限是一个基本挑战，现有的导数研究尚未被用于增强GNN表达能力。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN(HOD-GNN)，利用基础模型的高阶节点导数生成表达性结构感知节点嵌入，通过第二个GNN进行端到端训练。

Conclusion: 节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN在表达能力和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

TL;DR: MINTO提出了一种新的目标网络更新规则，通过取目标网络和在线网络的最小值作为目标估计，实现了更快更稳定的价值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标网络虽然稳定但学习缓慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。作者希望结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入MINTO方法，使用目标网络和在线网络的最小值作为目标估计，可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和actor-critic算法中。

Result: 在在线和离线强化学习、离散和连续动作空间等多种基准测试中，MINTO始终提升性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单有效的修改，在保持稳定性的同时加速了价值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Result: 在合成和真实欺诈数据集上的实验结果表明该方法有效，能够执行精确解，并能有效捕捉复杂特征-目标关系。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理高阶特征交互，在特征选择任务中表现出色，特别是在处理复杂依赖结构时优于传统方法。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA方法假设所有增量矩阵使用统一秩，未考虑不同模块和层中权重矩阵的重要性差异；AdaLoRA虽然通过SVD和奇异值剪枝实现动态秩分配，但存在收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的超网络动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，而非直接优化这些参数；通过剪枝超网络生成的奇异值输出实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲性能的情况下实现了更快的收敛；在其他基于LoRA的方法上的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效解决了AdaLoRA收敛慢的问题，同时保持了动态秩分配的优势，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统优化巡检传感平台的研究，提出了专门设计的巡检车辆配置，为桥梁健康监测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of

*Yongyi Yang,Tomaso Poggio,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了对于一类置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元之间诱导了双Lipschitz映射，并约束了神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率η存在一个拓扑临界点η*：低于η*时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化，降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑演化规律，揭示学习率对神经网络表达能力的影响机制。

Method: 通过分析置换等变学习规则（包括SGD、Adam等）在训练过程中诱导的双Lipschitz映射，建立神经元分布拓扑约束的理论框架。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*，区分了两种训练模式：低学习率保持拓扑结构，高学习率允许拓扑简化。结合边缘稳定性现象，将学习动态分为平滑优化和拓扑简化两个阶段。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于具体架构或损失函数，为拓扑方法在深度学习研究中的普遍应用提供了理论基础，揭示了学习率对神经网络表达能力的关键影响。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Conclusion: 指数集中是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态和大规模场景中，最有效的启发式往往高度复杂，这阻碍了可解释性、减缓了收敛速度，并限制了跨任务的可转移性。

Method: EvoSpeak从高质量GP启发式中学习并提取知识，利用这些知识：(i)生成热启动种群以加速收敛，(ii)将不透明的GP树转化为简洁的自然语言解释，(iii)在相关任务间实现知识转移和偏好感知的启发式生成。

Conclusion: 通过将GP的符号推理能力与LLMs的解释和生成优势相结合，EvoSpeak推动了现实世界优化问题中智能、透明和用户对齐的启发式的发展。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRAFT框架，将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT，并证明其隐式执行带重塑奖励的PPO。进一步引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别塑造分布，并通过逆噪声校正改进流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来塑造这些分布。传统策略梯度方法如PPO在扩散模型中难以应用，因为边际似然难以处理。

Method: 1. 将RAFT变体统一为GRAFT框架；2. 提出P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别进行分布塑造；3. 引入逆噪声校正改进流模型；4. 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成等任务上评估。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 2上，GRAFT框架在流行T2I基准测试中优于策略梯度方法，VQAScore相对基础模型提升8.81%。对于无条件图像生成，逆噪声校正以更低FLOPs/图像改善了生成图像的FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架为扩散模型提供了一种有效的微调方法，能够通过重塑奖励函数更好地适应下游任务，同时在多个生成任务上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

TL;DR: RAMAC框架将表达性生成actor与分布critic结合，在离线强化学习中实现风险敏感学习，在保持高回报的同时降低尾部风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要既能提供高回报又能避免灾难性风险的策略。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: 提出风险感知多模态actor-critic框架，结合表达性生成actor和分布critic，通过生成路径区分复合目标（分布风险和BC损失）。

Result: 在大多数Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC在保持强回报的同时，在CVaR0.1指标上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感学习与策略表达性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理策略，成功解决了LLM流式服务中的性能瓶颈，实现了响应性和吞吐量的双重优化。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

Conclusion: 梯度下降方法在深度ReLU网络中能够实现接近最优的泛化性能，关键突破是消除了对网络深度的指数依赖，为深度学习的理论分析提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

Motivation: 现有在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中仅关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这一被忽视的方面。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中，用能够使用真实值量化预测区间相关性的更广泛函数类替代二元评估（内部/外部），这有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数类替代二元评估，可以改进在线共形预测方法，产生更窄的预测区间而不牺牲覆盖有效性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛使用，推理能耗已成为AI能源足迹的主要部分，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，无法准确评估组件级能耗效率。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法（组件级能耗评估重复采样），通过重复采样解决微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗监测的时间不匹配问题，评估了15个涵盖4种架构类型的模型。

Result: 注意力块每FLOP消耗显著更多能量，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例，FLOPs无法准确反映组件级真实能耗成本。CLEAR方法能将组件级能耗方差控制在9.5%以下，捕获模型总能耗90%以上。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能Transformer模型提供了重要见解和基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到伪相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移鲁棒，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出分层扩展的Group DRO方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，提供多层次的分布偏移鲁棒性。并引入新的基准设置来模拟真实的少数群体分布偏移。

Result: 在现有鲁棒学习方法持续失败的情况下，该方法在这些条件下表现出强大的鲁棒性，同时在标准基准测试中也取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕获组间和组内分布不确定性非常重要。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列虽然渐近等价于随机i.i.d.输入，但在有限时间内可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。虽然对抗性输入算法自然能在随机顺序中保持遗憾保证，但一些简单的无遗憾随机算法在随机顺序实例中会失败。

Method: 提出了一个通用模板来将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，而不显著影响其遗憾保证。该方法允许在多个场景中恢复改进的遗憾界，包括延迟预测、带约束在线学习和切换成本赌博机。

Result: 成功将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，在多个应用场景中获得了改进的遗憾界。在在线分类中证明了在随机顺序模型中，可学习性由VC维而非Littlestone维表征，这进一步与一般对抗模型分离。

Conclusion: 提出的适配模板有效解决了随机顺序模型中的非平稳性问题，扩展了随机学习算法的适用范围，并在理论层面揭示了随机顺序模型与对抗模型在可学习性表征上的重要差异。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理波动的推理工作负载。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列建模任务时面临计算负担与表达能力之间的平衡挑战，需要找到既能最大化表达能力又能限制计算成本的方法。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析和平衡截断框架，在训练过程中识别并保留高影响力维度，压缩原始系统到更小的表示形式。该方法适用于线性时不变SSMs，也可扩展到选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明，训练过程中的压缩显著加速了优化过程，同时保持了表达能力。压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，而直接在较小维度上训练的模型会丢失这些结构。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中逐渐缩小的状态空间模型能够在实现计算效率的同时保持更高的性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Conclusion: 提出的迭代优化框架为VAR提供了新的理论视角，使其能够利用扩散生态系统工具，同时保持少步骤、尺度并行生成的优势。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了良好的预测性能，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Conclusion: Karma通过知识引导和频率自适应学习，为跨领域应用提供了更安全可靠的电池管理解决方案。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

*Aleksei Arzhantsev,Otmane Sakhi,Flavian Vasile*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出RoiRL方法，通过离线迭代强化学习替代在线强化学习，显著降低计算成本并提高推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要真实奖励信号，而测试时强化学习(TTRL)虽然使用多数投票奖励但计算成本高昂，需要寻找更轻量级的替代方案

Method: RoiRL采用离线迭代强化学习，优化加权对数似然目标，无需维护参考模型，实现稳定训练并降低内存和计算需求

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中持续优于TTRL

Conclusion: RoiRL为无需标签的自改进大语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，通过预测性水印、双向水印及其组合策略解决传统水印方法在非顺序解码模型上的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度且质量相当，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门设计的水印框架。

Method: 提出三种互补策略：预测性水印（在缺乏实际上下文时使用模型预测的token）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后向依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合两种方法最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，同时保持文本质量，而现有方法的朴素适配仅能达到49.6-71.2%。

Conclusion: DMark证明了在非自回归语言模型上进行有效水印是可行的，且对文本操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

Motivation: 当前最先进的细胞分化动力学模型依赖计算昂贵的预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用。

Method: 提出Cell-MNN编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是控制从干细胞到组织细胞演化动力学的局部线性化ODE，完全端到端训练。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN为细胞分化动力学建模提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在非IID数据分布下的性能下降和公平性问题，特别关注提升表现不佳客户端的训练效果。

Method: 结合多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制，在聚合时给本地错误率低的客户端分配更高权重；同时动态调整焦点损失参数来提升表现不佳客户端的训练，重点关注难分类样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的实验表明，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto方法，实现了更好的公平性和有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost通过集成动态提升和自适应聚合策略，有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和整体性能。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Motivation: 医疗时间序列分析面临数据稀疏、噪声和长度变化大的挑战，现有方法在处理可变长度信号和提供可解释性方面存在不足。

Method: 将随机稀疏采样框架推广到检索信息分类，通过通道内相似性加权窗口预测，并在概率空间进行聚合，产生凸序列级分数和明确的证据追踪。

Result: 在四个医疗中心收集的iEEG记录上评估，该方法实现了有竞争力的分类性能，并为从业者提供了更高的透明度和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在可靠和可解释的临床可变长度时间序列分类方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续强化学习主要关注风险中性决策，仅优化期望长期性能。本文旨在将风险感知决策引入持续强化学习，使智能体能够考虑超越均值的长期性能度量。

Method: 首先证明传统风险度量理论与持续设置不兼容，然后引入新的遍历风险度量类别，这些度量与持续学习兼容，并通过案例研究和实证结果验证其有效性。

Result: 提出的遍历风险度量在风险感知持续学习中表现出直观吸引力和理论合理性，为解决持续强化学习中的风险感知问题提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过引入遍历风险度量，成功将风险感知决策扩展到持续强化学习领域，为开发能够在保留有用信息和适应新情况之间保持平衡的风险感知RL智能体提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Conclusion: 该研究为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了实用且可推广的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is

ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕捉专家行为的丰富结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究模糊监督问题的框架，能有效处理各种形式的不精确监督，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Method: 使用通道级混合精度量化，在云端通过辅助超网络模块识别用户特定的关键参数，进行多粒度参数敏感性分析，并将量化策略编码为每通道2位进行传输。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和两个流行骨干网络上的实验表明，CHORD在准确性、效率和适应性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CHORD框架成功实现了个性化与资源自适应部署的平衡，通过设备-云协作消除了昂贵的重训练周期，同时最小化了通信开销。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发具有不确定性感知能力的大规模原子模拟MLPs提供了强大框架

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Conclusion: ZeroShotOpt提供了一个可重用的优化基础，为未来扩展和改进奠定了基础，在样本效率和泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC

clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks

Motivation: 深度强化学习在旅行商问题上取得进展，但对其变体接近旅行商问题关注有限，主要挑战在于基于邻域的访问标准。

Method: 使用离散化方案制定马尔可夫决策过程，提出UD3RL框架，包含特征提取编码器、节点解码器和位置解码器，引入k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理。

Conclusion: UD3RL是解决接近旅行商问题的有效方法，具有良好的泛化性能和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上表现不如传统优化方法，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决这一差距，特别是在图对齐这一NP难问题上。

Method: 训练一系列GNN，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络生成的相似度矩阵。采用基于节点对的架构而非单个节点，捕捉标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，能唯一解决正则图问题。与传统优化方法结合后，在图对齐基准测试中大幅超越最先进求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法显著提升了图神经网络在图对齐问题上的性能，证明了迭代优化和全局结构建模的重要性，为GNN在组合优化问题中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分数蒸馏的方法，显著减少了蛋白质骨架生成的采样步骤，实现了20倍以上的速度提升，同时保持了与原始模型相当的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成中表现出色，但采样速度慢（需要数百步迭代），限制了其在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用分数身份蒸馏(SiD)技术，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时在可设计性、多样性和新颖性方面与Proteina教师模型保持相当水平。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际蛋白质工程应用，实现了大规模计算机蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统的特征重要性度量方法可能不适用。需要一种能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法，以便解释决策、降低维度，甚至通过消除无用变量来提高性能。

Method: 基于验证性能变化的方法，在训练过程中通过置换特征值来确定相关特征。该方法与模型和任务无关，通过理论分析表征GNN性能如何依赖于节点数据和图结构之间的关系。

Result: 该方法不仅能在训练结束后返回特征重要性分数，还能跟踪特征相关性随特征逐步被移除的演变过程。实证结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性以及对更具挑战性图学习环境的适应性。

Conclusion: 提出的干预式方法能够有效识别图神经网络中的相关节点特征，提供了一种灵活且自适应的特征选择机制，有助于提升模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征（Betti数）来识别重要层，用于边缘设备上的高效神经网络重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应特定用户数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。现有方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合受限设备。

Method: 使用Betti数分析激活空间的拓扑特征，仅通过前向传播来对层进行重要性排序，无需标签或梯度即可选择具有高学习能力的重要层。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上评估，AdaBet比基于梯度的方法平均分类准确率提高5%，同时平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种高效、轻量级的层选择方法，适用于资源受限的边缘设备上的神经网络重训练。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Result: 在合成和真实语言建模任务中，VGB在多种指标上优于基线方法

Conclusion: VGB算法通过理论基础的随机游走和回溯机制，显著提高了对验证器错误的鲁棒性

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Conclusion: MoE学习中的近似误差和估计误差权衡取决于专家数量，为MoE模型设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于不确定性的主动学习方法在深度神经网络中效果不佳，因为模型的不确定性通常未校准，这会影响获取函数的有效性，导致泛化性能差和校准误差高。

Method: 提出新的获取函数，先估计校准误差并查询校准误差最高的样本，然后利用深度神经网络的不确定性。使用基于核的校准误差估计器处理协变量偏移问题。

Result: 理论上证明该方法能最终限制未标注池和未见测试数据上的校准误差。实证结果表明，该方法在池式主动学习设置中优于其他基线方法，具有更低的校准误差和泛化误差。

Conclusion: 通过主动学习校准误差，可以有效解决深度神经网络不确定性未校准的问题，提高模型性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文为学习率预热机制提供了理论解释，证明了在广义平滑性条件下，预热学习率比固定步长能实现更快的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热在现代深度学习中普遍使用，但其理论基础尚不明确，需要从原理上解释为什么预热能改善训练效果。

Method: 基于广义(L0,L1)-平滑性条件，该条件以损失次优性的线性函数限制局部曲率，并具有理想的闭包性质。在此假设下，分析了带预热调度的梯度下降方法。

Result: 理论和实验证明该平滑性条件在常见神经网络架构中成立，预热学习率相比固定步长能实现更快的收敛，并建立了上下复杂度界限。

Conclusion: 通过语言和视觉模型的实验验证了理论见解，确认了预热调度的实际益处，为预热机制提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

*Irene Tenison,Anna Murphy,Charles Beauville,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FTTE是一个新颖的半异步联邦学习框架，通过稀疏参数更新和基于更新年龄与方差的加权聚合，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习在资源受限边缘设备部署的挑战，包括内存、能耗和通信带宽限制，以及传统同步和异步方法在异构网络中存在的延迟和收敛缓慢问题。

Method: 采用半异步联邦学习框架，使用稀疏参数更新策略，并基于客户端更新的年龄和方差进行加权聚合。

Result: 在500个客户端和90%掉队者的场景下，相比同步联邦学习，FTTE实现了81%更快的收敛速度、80%更低的设备内存使用和69%的通信负载减少，同时达到可比或更高的目标精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构和资源受限边缘设备现实部署的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Density-QUCB算法，一种能够检测分布漂移的Q学习UCB算法，在非平稳强化学习环境中通过密度函数检测分布变化并改进不确定性估计，在理论和实验上都优于传统QUCB算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非平稳强化学习环境中，传统的Q学习UCB算法虽然能发现合适的策略，但由于分布漂移，该策略在变化发生后可能利用次优奖励。需要开发能够检测和适应分布变化的算法。

Method: 提出了Density-QUCB算法，使用转移密度函数来检测分布漂移，并利用其似然来增强Q学习UCB的不确定性估计质量，实现探索与利用的平衡。

Result: 理论上证明DQUCB比QUCB具有更好的遗憾保证；实证上DQUCB保持了模型无关RL的计算效率，在多个RL任务和真实世界COVID-19患者医院分配任务中都表现出更低的遗憾。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法通过密度函数检测分布漂移，有效改进了非平稳强化学习中的性能，在理论和实践中都优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准大多只评估最终答案，无法捕捉推理过程；而现有的逐步评估方法依赖启发式LLM评分或线性假设，限制了可靠性和诊断有效性。

Method: 将解决方案表示为公式的有向无环图，明确编码中间步骤间的因果依赖关系，结合完全基于规则的符号公式等价匹配方法进行验证。

Result: 评估框架与人类专家评分更一致，实验显示最先进的大语言模型在物理推理中存在持续失败，步骤级评分提供诊断洞察和训练信号。

Conclusion: PRISM-Physics通过结构严谨性、理论保证和符号验证，为过程级评估提供了原则性基础，指导开发具有更深科学推理能力的模型。

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了叠加现象如何影响神经表示对齐度量，发现不同叠加排列会干扰预测映射度量，导致对齐分数偏低。通过稀疏自编码器解耦叠加后，对齐分数显著提升。


<details>

Motivation: 研究叠加假设与表示对齐度量之间的相互作用，验证不同叠加排列是否会导致对齐度量产生不理想的干扰。

Method: 开发了关于严格排列度量对叠加排列依赖性的理论，使用稀疏自编码器在玩具模型中解耦叠加，并测试DNN-DNN和DNN-大脑线性回归对齐。

Result: 当用稀疏过完备潜在代码替换基础神经元时，对齐分数通常增加；在视觉领域的DNN-大脑线性回归对齐中也观察到类似提升。

Conclusion: 叠加解耦是映射度量揭示神经代码间真实表示对齐的必要条件。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和可穿戴传感器（惯性传感器和肌电图）来估计单臂哑铃弯举时的自觉用力程度（RPE），随机森林分类器表现最佳，准确率达到41.4%（精确匹配）和85.9%（±1 RPE误差范围内）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计自觉用力程度（RPE）可以通过个性化反馈和预防损伤来增强阻力训练效果。

Method: 收集了69组超过1000次重复的自定义数据集，使用可穿戴惯性传感器和肌电图（EMG）传感器数据，提取统计特征用于模型训练，评估了多种机器学习模型。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，精确准确率为41.4%，±1 RPE误差范围内的准确率为85.9%。离心重复时间被识别为最强的RPE预测因子。EMG数据的加入略微提高了模型准确性，但其效用可能受到数据质量和放置敏感性的限制。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估计的可行性，并确定了提高模型泛化能力的关键挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Best-of-Majority (BoM)推理策略，结合多数投票和Best-of-N的优势，在Pass@k设置下实现最优推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理中的多数投票和Best-of-N策略在困难任务中表现不佳，Pass@k评估设置需要更有效的推理策略。

Method: 提出BoM策略，首先限制候选响应为高频样本，然后选择前k个奖励最高的响应。

Result: 理论证明BoM在采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，遗憾为O(ε_opt+√(ε_RM²C*/k))，且为极小极大最优。实验显示BoM在数学问题上优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是Pass@k推理设置下的最优策略，性能不会随N增加而下降，优于现有方法。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分可观测强化学习中特权专家蒸馏与标准RL方法之间的权衡，发现该权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，且最优潜在策略并不总是最佳的蒸馏目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分可观测性是强化学习中的主要挑战，需要学习复杂的历史依赖策略。特权专家蒸馏利用训练期间的潜在状态信息来学习最优潜在马尔可夫策略，但存在已知的失败模式。

Method: 通过理论模型（扰动块MDP）和模拟运动任务的受控实验，对比特权专家蒸馏与无特权信息的标准RL方法。

Result: 实验表明该权衡取决于潜在动态的随机性，且最优潜在策略并非总是最佳的蒸馏目标，这与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果为有效利用特权信息提供了新指导原则，有望提高许多实际部分可观测领域中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在探索退化问题，传统方法单纯维持高策略熵会放大无关标记并破坏训练稳定性。研究发现有价值的低概率探索标记在训练过程中被过度惩罚而消失。

Method: 提出低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)，构建启发式代理分布，过滤噪声标记后重新归一化，放大推理标记的概率，通过KL散度作为软正则化目标保护这些有价值的标记。

Result: Lp-Reg能够稳定进行约1000步的在线训练，而基线方法在此阶段会崩溃。在五个数学基准测试上达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提升2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护有价值的低概率探索标记，有效解决了RLVR训练中的探索退化问题，实现了更稳定和有效的训练过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Conclusion: 当前网络代理存在多样性和脆弱性，BrowserArena的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理失败模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全风险：恶意示例可能在没有监督的情况下影响模型行为，需要内置防护机制。

Method: 定义零样本基准安全行为，应用分布无关风险控制来限制上下文示例对性能的负面影响，通过动态提前退出预测忽略关注有害输入的注意力头。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上实现显著的计算效率提升。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为LLMs提供了内置的安全防护机制，能够在保持有益输入效率优势的同时，有效防御恶意上下文示例的攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large

representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Motivation: 虽然智能AI在自动化单个任务方面取得了进展，但管理复杂的多代理工作流仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。需要开发能够协调人机团队协作的自主代理系统。

Method: 提出自主管理代理概念，将工作流管理形式化为部分可观测随机博弈，识别四个基础挑战，并发布MA-Gym开源仿真评估框架，使用GPT-5代理在20个工作流上进行评估。

Result: 评估发现GPT-5基于的管理代理在联合优化目标完成、约束遵守和工作流运行时间方面表现不佳，突显工作流管理是一个困难的开放性问题。

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是当不同模态之间存在冲突证据时。研究发现模型在单模态冲突识别中表现良好（90%准确率），但在跨模态冲突中表现急剧下降（仅3%），这归因于跨模态注意力不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 系统性地解决跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要，需要专门设计训练数据来促进跨模态推理能力。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时缩放（TTS）在样本数量K增大到一定程度后收益递减，提出温度维度缩放方法，通过多温度采样显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法仅通过增加样本数量来提升推理性能，但在大K值时收益有限，且不同温度能解决不同子集的问题，单温度缩放无法充分利用模型潜力。

Method: 提出温度缩放方法，沿温度维度生成多个推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度缩放比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型达到与强化学习训练模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 测试时缩放比预想的更强大，温度缩放为解锁基础模型潜力提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性理论存在局限性，需要一种专门针对真实世界事件可能性的新概念，特别是在规划问题中评估不同计划的可行性和易完成程度。

Method: 将事件视为具有促使其发生的前提条件和阻碍其发生的约束条件，使用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑解释逻辑连接词，通过前提条件成立概率和约束条件不发生概率的函数计算事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，可用于车辆路线规划等实际问题，能够确定哪个计划最可能（最容易或最可行）完成。

Conclusion: 该可能性模型可能正确捕捉了人类关于计划的正常推理模式，在规划问题中具有应用潜力，并提出了未来应用的展望。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLM）的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界VLM漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式，通过模型上下文协议（MCP）集成17种红队算法，设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%。构建了包含30K+红队实例的ARMs-Bench数据集，涵盖51个风险类别。

Conclusion: 使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调显著提高了VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV比基线方法F1分数提高10%-25%，同时比传统方法如CoT验证器减少6-58倍token使用。

Conclusion: NCV提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，提高了LLM推理验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

Conclusion: TRACE为工具增强LLM代理提供了有效的多维度评估方法，超越了传统的答案匹配评估，能够深入分析推理轨迹的质量。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

Method: 采用学习范式无关的分析框架，从技术误差(近似、估计、优化误差)和意图转化困难两个角度论证OSA的失效，并基于数学结果分析这些差距在强优化压力下的演变。

Result: 证明OSA在现实条件下必然失败，这些差距在缺乏数学表征时无法与Goodhart定律失效模式区分，且Goodhart临界点无法事先确定。

Conclusion: 必须对通用AI系统的优化设置原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控风险。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

*Xinle Wu,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，通过结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，动态选择奖励模型来提升语言模型对齐效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF/RLAIF依赖单一奖励模型，存在对齐质量限制和过拟合风险。现有RM路由方法面临冷启动和探索不足的问题

Method: 离线阶段训练多任务路由器评估每个RM的可靠性，在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样进行按查询的RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布

Result: 在指令跟随和推理基准测试中，BayesianRouter持续优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过混合路由框架有效解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了语言模型对齐性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

TL;DR: MaskGRPO是首个可行的离散扩散模型强化学习方法，通过重要性采样和模态特定适配，在数学推理、编程和视觉生成任务中实现更稳定高效的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型的非自回归特性使得重要性采样难以处理，传统强化学习方法如GRPO难以适用，需要新的优化方法。

Method: 提出MaskGRPO方法，包括构建重要性估计器捕捉令牌波动，为视觉序列定制rollout方法以产生多样补全和可靠梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编程和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来更稳定高效的更新，推理性能更强，生成质量更好。

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了系统性的策略优化方法，是离散视觉扩散的首个实用解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习系统是黑盒模型，缺乏对其推理过程的解释，这限制了其可信度和应用。可解释AI方法旨在解决这一问题，但不同方法基于不同的哲学假设，这些假设会影响解释的有效性。

Method: 通过调查可解释性方法应用于AI系统时的本体论和认识论假设，分析技术变化如何对应不同的解释假设，并评估忽略这些基础假设的风险。

Result: 分析表明，XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化可能对应着关于解释基础假设的重要差异，忽略这些假设可能导致解释无效或误导。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其背后的本体论和认识论范式，并根据不同应用领域的特点选择和适配适当的方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Motivation: 反事实解释在可解释AI中是强大工具，但在基于规则的智能环境领域尚无成熟方法，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了反事实解释的形式化方法和实现，作为现有智能环境解释引擎的插件扩展，并通过用户研究(N=17)评估效果。

Conclusion: 为智能环境贡献了实用的反事实解释框架，并提供了经验证据指导不同解释类型的选择时机。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究现代AI系统是否真正具备类比推理能力，还是仅仅依赖统计捷径，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下评估其泛化能力。

Method: 在Impartial-RAVEN数据集上故意在训练中省略若干结构规则，评估序列到序列transformer模型和视觉架构（如CoPINet和双对比网络）的表现。

Result: transformer模型在熟悉规则上表现良好，但在面对新颖或省略规则时准确率急剧下降；token级准确率与完整答案准确率之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本局限，需要超越模式识别、发展具备鲁棒抽象推理能力的架构。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
