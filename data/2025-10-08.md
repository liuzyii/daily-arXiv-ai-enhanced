### [1] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一种灵活高效的统一解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，并适应新任务，无需改变预训练扩散模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练扩散模型为图形应用提供强大先验，但生成应用和逆向方法需要额外的输入输出通道。现有通道扩展方案通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同扩散模型或新任务。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例（队友）进行协调和适应，采用新颖的低秩适应（LoRA）变体来处理适应和协调问题，支持队友的动态激活和停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形任务上展示了Teamwork的灵活性和效率，包括修复、单图像SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种统一且高效的方法来扩展扩散模型的通道能力，同时保持对预训练模型的架构不变性，适用于广泛的图形应用。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [2] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在数据稀缺情况下实现高效缺陷检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施检查中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，以及现有深度学习框架无法用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的局限性

Method: 使用自适应E-FPN编码器、原型学习和注意力机制，包括全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力

Result: 在2-way分类测试中达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来2.57% F1分数和2.9% mIoU提升

Conclusion: 该框架能够用有限的新训练数据快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，实现更高效经济的维护计划

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [3] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的皮肤分割技术，用于远程光电容积描记（rPPG）信号提取，通过优先选择皮肤区域来提高信号质量，在挑战性条件下（如说话和头部转动）保持心率预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，传统方法在无监督流程中需要先选择皮肤区域来提取信号。现有方法在真实场景中面临干扰问题，需要更鲁棒的皮肤分割技术。

Method: 引入新颖的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能引起干扰的区域（如嘴、眼、头发），提高对运动的抵抗能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上评估，模型在挑战性条件下（如说话和头部转动）能够有效捕捉心跳，保持心率预测的MAE，而其他方法无法做到。对多种肤色检测准确率高。

Conclusion: 该技术为真实世界应用提供了有前景的选择，特别是在多样化肤色和运动条件下具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [4] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf是一个结合空间和光谱特征的自动对焦框架，可将传统显微镜转换为高效玻片扫描仪，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片成像扫描仪成本高、现有低成本方案对焦不一致、耗时或泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出DeepAf框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦时间比堆栈方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，交叉实验室泛化能力强，假对焦预测仅0.72%，90%预测在景深范围内。在536个脑组织样本临床研究中，4x放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了全面的硬件-软件设计，在资源受限环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理学，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [6] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了动态引导方法，通过选择性锐化导致伪影方向的分数函数来减少扩散模型中的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。这种幻觉可归因于数据分布模式之间的过度平滑。

Method: 引入动态引导方法，仅沿已知导致伪影的预定方向选择性锐化分数函数，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，动态引导有效减少了扩散模型中的幻觉生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [7] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练免费的视频生成加速方法LightCache，通过分析扩散模型推理过程中的编码、去噪和解码阶段，采用异步缓存交换、特征分块和切片解码三种策略来降低内存消耗，在保持质量的同时实现更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理过程中存在潜在冗余，基于缓存的加速方法通常会在去噪和解码阶段导致内存激增，需要解决内存消耗问题。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对不同阶段特性提出：1）异步缓存交换；2）特征分块；3）切片解码。确保策略引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: LightCache方法有效解决了视频生成扩散模型推理中的内存消耗问题，在保持质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [8] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的时间反向重建框架，利用RGB和热图像对来恢复几秒前的场景状态，结合视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能够捕捉人机交互留下的热痕迹，这些逐渐消失的热印记可以作为被动时间编码，推断出RGB相机无法检测的近期事件，在法医学和场景分析中具有应用潜力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程耦合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。使用配对的RGB和热图像进行时间反向重建。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明能够重建120秒前的合理过去帧，为基于热痕迹的时间反向成像提供了初步实现。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热痕迹进行时间反向重建的可行性，为恢复过去场景状态提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [9] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的方法，通过可训练的映射网络将对象实例的局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现个性化图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是实现结合对象实例图像信息和自然语言描述的复合查询图像检索，例如检索"Fluffy独角兽在某人头上"的图像。

Method: 设计映射网络将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，使标记与自然语言查询的组合适合CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次。

Result: 使用可训练的pi-map映射网络与冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器，在两个个性化检索基准上改进了现有技术水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将对象实例映射为文本标记，有效实现了结合视觉实例和文本描述的复合查询图像检索。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [10] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头像框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率和视觉质量的应用场景中的实用性。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别实现SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%等），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练即可连续控制细节级别的3D高斯头像，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的动作识别新方法，结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D点云动作识别方面具有竞争力，为密集3D数据在动作识别中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼度量的扩散模型插值方法，通过在噪声空间中定义新度量，使测地线沿着数据流形进行，从而产生更自然和忠实的插值过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了流形感知的分析和操作。现有插值方法通常沿着高密度区域路径，但这些路径不一定与数据流形对齐，导致感知上不自然的过渡。

Method: 在噪声空间中定义新的黎曼度量，该度量基于得分函数雅可比矩阵捕获局部数据流形切空间的性质，鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度和朴素基线方法产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡效果。

Conclusion: 通过利用扩散模型学习的数据流形几何结构，提出的黎曼度量方法能够实现更符合数据内在结构的插值操作。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种自监督学习架构，首次能够仅从自然视频中同时学习物体识别和运动理解的强视觉表示，通过将潜在动态建模扩展到该领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法主要专注于学习识别或运动的表示，而非两者兼顾。潜在动态建模在决策制定中用于学习观察及其随时间变化的潜在表示，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network采用中间自顶向下路径来推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，使用密集前向预测目标和层次结构来处理自然视频中复杂的多对象场景。

Result: 在两个大规模自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上相对于先前的自监督学习方法表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Midway Network能够同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表示，其学习的动态可以通过前向特征扰动分析捕获高级对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、逼真渲染或可靠动态模拟等方面存在不足，需要一种能够同时满足这些关键要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题形式化重建过程，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，通过采样探索和梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化，使用交互式场景图表示编码物体几何、外观、物理属性及层次关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估显示优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的逼真渲染效果。

Conclusion: HoloScene框架在交互式游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展现了广泛的适用性和有效性，为物理世界的数字化提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升文本驱动图像检索任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器(CVE)，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间提出判别概念校准器(DCC)，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了文本驱动图像检索的性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链中的冗余，使提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归多模态大语言模型在图像生成中使用思维链推理时会产生不必要的冗余（视觉过度思考），这增加了计算成本并可能引入与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 引入ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数根据任务难度鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将其整合到强化学习范式中。

Result: 在多个基准测试（T2I-CompBench、GenEval）上，提示推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提升质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂；MLLM在人-物交互检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出HOI-R1模型，引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习训练MLLM，仅通过纯文本解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线方法2倍准确率，具有出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOID任务中的潜力，无需额外检测模块即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致训练成本高昂

Method: 使用分布式架构的轻量控制模块，包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，并引入早期中心采样策略

Result: 在尺度自回归模型上验证，实现高保真度和多样性的图像生成控制，超越现有基线，显著提升训练和推理效率

Conclusion: ECM框架为自回归模型提供了高效的空间条件生成解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的生成框架，通过多尺度分解将自回归目标与点集的无序性对齐，首次在自回归范式中实现最先进的点云生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归点云生成在质量上长期落后于基于扩散的方法，主要原因是自回归模型对无序点集施加了人为排序，导致模型难以捕捉长程依赖关系，无法保证全局结构属性如对称性、一致拓扑和大尺度几何规律。

Method: 受形状建模中的细节层次原则启发，提出PointNSP框架：在低分辨率下保留全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式在更高尺度上逐步细化细粒度几何。这种多尺度分解避免了脆弱的固定排序。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，并且在参数、训练和推理效率上超越了强扩散基线。在8192点的密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP证明了自回归方法在点云生成中的潜力，通过多尺度分解有效解决了传统自回归模型的排序偏差问题，在保持高效率的同时实现了卓越的生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

Motivation: 解决现有地理空间基础模型部署受限的两个主要问题：缺乏自动化地理空间数据处理流程，以及微调后模型仍然过大难以部署。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：(1)自动化数据整理，将原始卫星图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定模型蒸馏，生成紧凑的计算高效模型；(3)无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Result: 在三个任务上复现了已发表研究的数据集，模型性能差异很小：洪水制图-0.73pp，作物分割-0.20pp，沙漠蝗虫预测+1.79pp。蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，显著减少FLOPs和CO2排放。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Motivation: 当前生成图像检测器通常被视为黑盒，不清楚它们是否真正依赖频谱域伪影（特别是周期性峰值）来检测合成图像，这限制了检测器的可解释性和可信度。

Method: 提出了一种移除图像频谱峰值的方法，并分析这种操作对多个检测器的影响；同时引入了一个仅依赖频率峰值的简单线性检测器作为完全可解释的基准。

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明和可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: 双曲和欧几里得空间的组合能有效提升深度度量学习的性能，CHEST损失为解决双曲空间中代理损失应用问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位（AHP）是斜视等眼部错位引起的代偿机制，早期诊断很重要但当前临床评估主观且受不完整医疗记录影响。

Method: AHP-CADNet：多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿态特征和结构化临床属性；课程学习插补框架：逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床笔记处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R2>0.93；插补框架在所有临床变量上保持高准确率（93.46-99.78%）。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复都有效，证实了其在现实数据条件下的诊断鲁棒性。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有教育AI方法主要关注短期或单智能体场景，难以系统研究真实教室的复杂性、动态社交互动和长期发展过程，限制了跨任务重用。

Method: 提出EduVerse系统，采用分层CIE（认知-互动-演化）架构，支持环境、智能体和会话的自定义，并包含人机回环接口允许真实用户参与。

Result: 在中学语文课堂验证中：教学对齐方面模拟IRF率(0.28-0.64)接近真实教室(0.37-0.49)；群体互动网络密度0.27-0.40；跨会话演化中积极转换率平均增长11.7%。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Method: 提出SD-MVSum方法，使用加权跨模态注意力机制建模脚本-视频和脚本-文本模态间的依赖关系，利用语义相似性选择与用户脚本最相关的视频片段。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired

TL;DR: ARGUS提出了一种新的肝脏癌组织学分型方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，显著提升了肝脏癌组织学分型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝脏原发恶性肿瘤是消化系统中最具异质性和预后多样性的癌症，其中肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌的组织形态和细胞结构比其他常见肿瘤更为复杂。现有方法未能充分利用全切片图像中的层次金字塔结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示等关键信息，导致对组织学表征的理解有限和分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS方法包括三个主要部分：1) 构建微几何特征，通过细胞核间的几何结构表示细粒度细胞级模式；2) 设计分层视野对齐模块，建模全切片图像中固有的宏观和中观层次交互；3) 通过几何先验引导融合策略将增强的微几何和视野特征融合为联合表示，以建模整体表型交互。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝脏癌组织学分型中实现了最先进的性能，为临床实践中肝脏原发恶性肿瘤提供了有效的诊断工具。

Conclusion: ARGUS通过有效捕获肿瘤微环境中的多层次信息，显著提升了肝脏癌组织学分型的准确性和可靠性，为临床诊断提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的流程，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入到背景场景中，实现真实的人物场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物定位和个性化视为独立问题，忽视了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖特定训练。本文旨在开发一个统一的无需训练框架来解决这一挑战。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导，实现感知全局编辑；提出掩码引导的自注意力机制，从单张参考图像中保持人物身份、服装和身体特征。

Result: 在多样化合成场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需任务特定训练即可实现真实的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像机录制自动编辑的多模态架构，通过时间分割（何时剪切）和空间选择（如何剪切）两个子任务，使用音频频谱和图像嵌入等方法，在剪切点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于解决古典音乐会多摄像机录制的编辑挑战。

Method: 将问题分解为时间分割（何时剪切）和空间选择（如何剪切）两个子任务。时间分割使用轻量级卷积-变换器管道集成音频频谱和可选图像嵌入；空间选择使用CLIP编码器替代传统ResNet，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会的片段中。

Result: 模型在检测剪切点方面优于之前的基线方法，在视觉镜头选择方面提供了有竞争力的结果，推进了多模态自动视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态架构在自动视频编辑任务中表现出色，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像机录制编辑方面，通过分解问题和改进方法取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

TL;DR: 开发了一种结合形态和空间特征的图像分析流水线，通过时间整合方法在复杂条件下准确识别和量化莴苣幼苗，验证了低成本成像系统与先进计算工具结合进行植物表型分析的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究R. solani接种对莴苣种子萌发和早期发育的影响，需要一种能够在复杂生长条件下准确监测和量化幼苗的方法，特别是在传统图像分析技术失效的密集和交织生长场景中。

Method: 使用低成本图像监测系统连续捕获感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了结合形态和空间特征的新型图像分析流水线，采用时间整合方法考虑当前状态和先前时间点的发展轨迹。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在幼苗计数和活力评估中表现出高准确性，即使在密集交织生长条件下也能准确量化，决定系数达到0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性、可扩展表型数据获取的可行性，特别在传统分割技术失效的复杂生长条件下表现出色。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对象级表示的视觉语义标记化方法，通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，来提升视觉模型的推理和上下文学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面落后于语言模型，这可能是由于视觉变换器训练方案缺乏语义和上下文指导。论文认为通过设计语义基础的目标可以缩小这一差距。

Method: 提出将视觉对象作为视觉等价于语言单词进行建模，通过掩码图像建模框架，对视觉对象而非随机补丁应用掩码，推动模型学习视觉元素间的全局上下文和语义。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有对象级表示时经常被学习。在多模态大语言模型的视觉问答任务上显示出强大的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码在视觉表示学习中非常有效，为开发更强的视觉编码器和标记器提供了可行的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时难以精确控制年龄，且微调通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现中间年龄肖像的高质量生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标注数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的年龄编辑。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有合成图像检测研究主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽视了同样重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 结合CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型的优势，构建统一特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准上比最接近的竞争对手准确率高3.87%，平均精度高6.13%，在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，对常见图像扰动具有出色鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了顶级性能的检测器，还引入了新的基准和框架，推动通用AI图像检测的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

<details>

Motivation: 室外LiDAR点云的手动标注成本高昂且耗时，现有方法仍需人工标注。为了完全消除对标注的依赖，需要开发完全无监督的实例分割方法。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进性能，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超过了使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法（48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割的可行性，通过综合设计实现了超越有监督方法的性能。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多级级联架构，查询图像和商品在不同阶段的表示存在差异，导致难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 提出基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）的生成框架，采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持强视觉相似性先验的同时有效整合用户特定信息。

Result: 离线评估中性能与在线MCA相当，推理效率提升21%；A/B测试显示显著提升：商品点击率+2.15%，转化率+2.27%，订单量+3.12%。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源训练深度网络，解决了遥感图像分类中高质量标签稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖其最后一层表示进行检测，这忽视了中间层可能包含的丰富分布偏移信号。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则来自动识别在无训练设置下提供最互补信息的中间层，无需访问OOD数据，选择性地整合这些中间层表示。

Conclusion: 揭示了OOD检测研究的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振短轴和四腔长轴图像中检测五个关键帧，相比基于容积的方法在ED和ES检测精度上提升30%-51%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入分析心肌运动模式。准确的多个关键帧检测可以解决个体心动周期差异带来的时间对齐问题。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，通过密集可变形配准场计算一维运动描述符，从特征曲线中基于简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在三个公共多中心数据集中验证，ED和ES检测精度提升30%-51%，五个关键帧的平均循环帧差异低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现不依赖周期或相位长度的心脏动态时间对齐分析，为患者间和患者内比较提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来提升LLM长视频理解能力的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动token剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频理解中的时空冗余问题，以及多模态大语言模型上下文长度有限的挑战。现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型的语义先验，本文创新性地引入光流运动先验。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化（TGO）利用粗粒度光流分组相似视觉内容并用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动token剪枝（MTP）利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频的时空冗余问题，显著提升了LLM的长视频理解能力，在多个基准测试中超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: acia-workflows平台成功地将先进的深度学习工具整合到可访问、可复现和可扩展的工作流程中，为活细胞成像数据分析提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用多模态数据（图像和元数据），应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个细胞内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双层优化训练策略。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别比现有方法提升约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上达到93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得革命性进展，但其离散token预测机制带来了新的合成图像检测挑战，需要专门方法应对AR模型的独特特征。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D³QE)方法，设计动态码本频率统计的transformer，将语义特征与量化误差潜在特征融合到注意力机制中。

Result: 在ARForensics数据集上的实验表明，D³QE在不同AR模型中具有优越检测精度和强泛化能力，对现实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D³QE方法有效解决了自回归生成图像的检测问题，为应对新兴AR模型带来的检测挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了弱监督上下文学习（WS-ICL），使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签，显著减少医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习模型）虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要为每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签。

Method: 提出WS-ICL新范式，利用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，而不是密集标签，消除对精细掩码和所有图像重复用户提示的需求。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试中，WS-ICL以显著更低的标注成本实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能，并且在交互范式下也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效和统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流场景缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集比现有基准大40倍，包含超过23万张图像和29,000个缺陷实例，解决了现有方法在零售物流异常检测中因姿态和外观多样性而表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测数据集（如MVTec-AD和VisA）主要针对制造场景，姿态控制严格且对象类别有限，已接近饱和。而零售物流中的异常检测面临对象姿态和外观多样性的新挑战，现有方法在此场景下表现不佳。

Method: 构建了一个大规模物流缺陷检测数据集，包含超过230,000张图像、29,000个缺陷实例和48,000个不同对象，并对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现不超过56.96% AUROC，远低于在制造场景数据集上的表现（可达99.9% AUROC），表明现有方法难以处理姿态和外观变化大的场景。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，揭示了现有方法在处理姿态和外观多样性方面的局限性，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学影像中的token mixer设计，在MetaFormer架构下比较了池化、卷积和注意力机制，发现在分类任务中简单token mixer足够，而在分割任务中卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在医学影像领域应用较少，且缺乏对不同token mixer的系统比较，可能错失更合适的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixer，在8个医学影像数据集上进行图像分类和语义分割评估，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）足够，预训练权重依然有效；分割任务中卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积在减少计算量和参数的同时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务中token mixer的选择应根据任务类型：分类任务可用简单token mixer，分割任务需要卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积是理想选择。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入动态模态分解特征值聚类技术，获得数据驱动的MCA字典，形成DMCA方法。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA在视频去噪中的有效性，提高了微弱目标与海况混合信号的信噪比，并成功分离了逆合成孔径雷达图像中的自行车和风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的字典学习，能够有效分离视频和图像中的不同形态成分，在去噪和目标分离任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散模型的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，这些强大技术对现有鲁棒水印方案构成了新的威胁，需要研究扩散模型如何影响水印的生存能力。

Method: 提出扩散驱动的图像再生过程来擦除嵌入水印，并引入引导扩散攻击在生成过程中明确针对水印信号，显著降低水印可检测性。

Result: 在多个最先进水印方案（StegaStamp、TrustMark、VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，强调了在生成式AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Motivation: 传统冰雹传感器覆盖范围有限，需要利用社交媒体图像来获取更密集的空间信息，实现更快更详细的恶劣天气评估。

Method: 使用474张奥地利冰雹事件图像，比较四种模型和单阶段与两阶段提示策略，后者利用图像中的参考物体（如人手）提供尺寸线索。

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可测量冰雹直径，两阶段提示提高了大多数模型的可靠性，最佳模型平均绝对误差为1.12厘米。

Conclusion: 现成模型可以补充传统冰雹传感器，从社交媒体图像中提取有意义的信息，但自动实时图像采集仍是待解决的问题。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Motivation: 在持续学习环境中生成准确连贯的图像描述面临灾难性遗忘和视觉概念与语言对齐困难的挑战

Method: 基于预训练ViT-GPT-2骨干网络，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导对比损失

Result: 该方法缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于最先进方法，且推理时无需额外开销和提示

Conclusion: 多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，有效平衡了知识保留和新任务学习

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中可大幅减少人工分析监控视频的工作量，但研究发现这些模型存在意外出现的能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能通过过度学习识别特定个体，引发个人数据识别和画像的担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型意外发展出的个人重识别能力，这种能力可能被滥用于个人识别和画像，而目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验测试这些方法在限制模型个人重识别能力方面的效果。

Result: 结合两种方法可将个人重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现防护措施存在关键漏洞，如可能通过部分人物图像绕过。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Abstract: We introduce Universal Neural Architecture Space (UniNAS), a generic search
space for neural architecture search (NAS) which unifies convolutional
networks, transformers, and their hybrid architectures under a single, flexible
framework. Our approach enables discovery of novel architectures as well as
analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new
search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and
demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

TL;DR: VideoMiner通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法精确定位关键帧，解决了长视频理解中冗余信息干扰和复杂层次结构适应的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1）如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2）如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner方法，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构；引入T-GRPO（树基组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，专门针对树结构设计，整合事件级时空信息。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D Morphable Models，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又具有计算效率的方法。

Method: 扩展Learned Vertex Descent (LVD)，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，使用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置中达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性强的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，在3D人脸重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: 将医学领域专用视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，在腹腔镜手术任务中显著提升了性能，相比标准视觉PPO有66.67%到1114.29%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临的高维视觉输入、稀疏奖励和特征提取困难等问题。

Method: 集成MedFlamingo医学视觉语言模型与PPO，每回合处理一次任务观察和指令生成高级规划令牌，结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO表现优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 医学专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，MedFlamingo PPO方法有效解决了视觉观察的挑战。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准。研究发现逐步推理对解决CAPTCHA至关重要，现有商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%），但通过逐步推理可显著提升性能。作者提出了CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，在五种高难度CAPTCHA上达到83.9%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类和机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业视觉语言模型在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要探索如何提升其推理能力。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含七类CAPTCHA的逐步动作解决方案和基础标注。定义了五个面向推理的评估指标，并提出了一个通用的基于代理的视觉语言模型框架，利用模型固有的推理能力。

Result: 现有商业视觉语言模型在CAPTCHA上的平均准确率仅为21.9%。提出的方法在五种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到83.9%的平均解决准确率，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性。逐步推理能显著提升模型在复杂空间任务中的表现。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，用于改善Vision Transformers的可解释性，通过过滤噪声产生更忠实和可解释的注意力图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT解释方法依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为注意力捕获的是层内token-to-token交互。需要一种能保留注意力价值同时过滤噪声的方法。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，并扩展了类别特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法能产生更清晰、更可解释的注意力图，在忠实性指标和人类感知对齐方面优于或媲美现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 注意力仍然是可解释信号，通过适当过滤可以产生高效且人类可理解的可解释AI方法，人类可解释性对XAI至关重要。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在视频推理任务中应用Chain-of-Thought(CoT)机制的问题，发现CoT会导致性能下降，产生误导性内部独白，作者称之为"视觉思维漂移"现象，并提出了Visual Evidence Reward(VER)框架来解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT机制在文本任务中提升了推理能力，但在视频理解中的应用效果不佳，经常导致性能下降，产生幻觉视觉细节和覆盖正确直觉的问题。

Method: 提出了Visual Evidence Reward(VER)强化学习框架，明确奖励生成可验证地基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个不同的视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够稳健地将推理基于视觉证据的AI模型，实现"在思考时也能看到"的多模态模型。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Conclusion: 该开源数据集填补了高质量左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉分割数据的空白，为医学影像分析特别是左心耳形态研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效融合多级先验，实现高光谱图像超分辨率，并提供了理论收敛保证。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床使用的生存分析模型难以解释，传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽略了肿瘤的全局背景且缺乏与基因组数据的语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间，整合WSI全局局部特征和基因组数据；采用稳健表型表示、指数原型更新策略和分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的评估表明，该方法在准确性和可解释性方面均优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新视角，实现了可追踪和可解释的决策过程。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了其在统一医学生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统'定位-分割'流水线存在的信息瓶颈和时序一致性问题，传统方法将语义简化为粗略几何提示，且分割过程与初始语言定位解耦。

Method: 提出FlowRVS框架，将RVOS重新定义为条件连续流问题，利用预训练T2V模型的优势，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的最先进结果：MeViS上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提高1.6），零样本Ref-DAVIS17上为73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，单阶段生成方法优于传统的级联设计。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在日常场景中从单张图像预测双手3D运动和关节动作的问题，由于缺乏多样场景下的3D手部标注数据，需要设计有效的标注流程。

Method: 设计了一个标注流程，使用扩散模型将2D手部关键点序列提升为4D手部运动；在预测模型中使用扩散损失来处理手部运动分布的多模态特性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的标注流程和扩散模型，有效解决了日常场景中3D手部运动预测的数据稀缺问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观，但现有方法存在时间不一致和优化效率低的问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样与4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，实现端到端的动态3D表示生成。

Result: 方法能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，无需逐帧优化，在多样化野外视频中提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的原生视频到4D形状生成框架在时间一致性和生成质量上优于基线方法，为动态3D内容生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型在生成多样高质量图像方面表现出色，但难以融入精细的相机元数据（如精确光圈设置），无法实现可控的镜头模糊效果。

Method: 模拟物理图像形成过程：首先生成全对焦图像，估计其单目深度，使用新颖的焦点距离变换器预测合理的对焦距离，然后使用现有的可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像。梯度通过整个过程反向传播，实现无显式监督学习。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的精细控制，在推理时提供精确的交互式用户控制。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机EXIF数据，实现了现有扩散模型无法达到的精确镜头模糊控制，同时保持场景内容不变。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，无需深度传感器即可达到RGB-D级别的精度，通过三个预训练视觉模块替代主动深度输入，在动态环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发无需深度传感器的SLAM系统，利用现代预训练视觉模型替代主动深度传感器，实现更简单、成本更低的SLAM解决方案。

Method: 使用三个预训练视觉模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络；通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态对象，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间；使用未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端进行跟踪和建图。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，性能匹配或超越最先进的RGB-D方法，在单个GPU上以22 FPS实时运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，标志着向更简单、成本更低的SLAM系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个专注于夜间自我中心视觉的综合基准，以视觉问答为核心任务，通过日夜对齐视频揭示光照条件对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽视了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要专门研究夜间场景的视觉理解挑战。

Method: 收集Blender渲染的合成视频和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐；构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，使用日间增强的夜间自动标注引擎，并通过大量人工验证进行精炼。

Result: EgoNight-VQA包含90个视频中的3658个QA对，涵盖12种QA类型；评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型从白天到夜晚转移时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的自我中心视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的单次前向传播框架，用于从单目视频实时重建4D人体-场景，无需多阶段处理或迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和大量预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM），导致效率低下且复杂。Human3R旨在实现端到端的统一重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，在单次前向传播中联合恢复全局多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上仅训练一天，即可实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在多项任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R提供了一个简单而强大的基线，可作为下游应用的统一模型，消除了复杂依赖和迭代优化。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

<details>

Motivation: 随着文本到图像扩散模型在内容创作中的影响力增强，需要评估它们准确表现历史背景的能力，而现有研究主要关注人口统计和文化偏见，历史表现评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发了HistVis数据集，包含30,000张由三种最先进扩散模型生成的合成图像，使用精心设计的提示词描绘不同历史时期的普遍人类活动。评估包括三个关键方面：隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示。

Result: 研究发现文本到图像模型在历史主题图像生成中存在系统性不准确，经常通过融入未声明的风格线索来刻板化过去时代，引入时代错误，并且未能反映合理的人口统计模式。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估生成图像中的历史表现提供了可扩展的方法和基准，是构建更准确历史表现和文化对齐的文本到图像模型的初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估方法对英语和欧洲语言有效，但不适用于印度语言，特别是古吉拉特语，因此需要开发专门的评估指标。

Method: 采用基于监督学习的方法，使用25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6隐藏层和10隐藏层，各500轮训练），在7个MT系统的1000个输出上与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标与其他可用指标相比，产生了更好的人类相关性，表明该方法对古吉拉特语机器翻译评估有效。

Conclusion: 成功开发了针对古吉拉特语的机器翻译评估指标，填补了印度语言MT评估的空白，为古吉拉特语MT系统性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工程方法将幻觉视为需要最小化的缺陷，而理论分析认为其不可避免，但两种视角在考虑AGI需求时都不完整，需要重新审视幻觉的本质。

Method: 基于封闭世界和开放世界假设，对幻觉进行分类，区分可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型，并分析不同条件下的处理策略。

Result: 提出了幻觉的分类框架，明确了在开放世界条件下某些幻觉的不可避免性，为理解和管理LLM幻觉提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 幻觉不应仅仅被视为工程缺陷，而应作为需要容忍的结构性特征，并使其与人类智能兼容，这对实现AGI至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

Method: 利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯的支持性回复，并采用强化学习来精炼和强化推理过程

Result: CARE显著提高了回复的逻辑合理性和支持性质量

Conclusion: 该框架推动了具有同理心、认知鲁棒性和类人特征的情感支持系统的发展

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，实现低成本训练数据生成。

Method: 采用三个协调代理：模拟多样化人物行为的用户代理、执行任务导向说服策略的对话代理，以及评估和优化对话结果的优化代理，通过智能体自我博弈生成对话。

Result: 在真实营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小语言模型的说服能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效生成高质量对话数据，提升模型说服能力，具有明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

TL;DR: IDIOMoE通过将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的一种方言，在预训练LLM中分离文本专家和物品专家，实现协同过滤信号与自然语言的统一理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的需求。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络拆分为文本专家和物品专家，使用token类型门控避免模态间干扰。

Result: 在公共和专有数据集上展现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功统一了协同过滤和LLM的优势，为现代推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改进大语言模型的不确定性表达能力，提高校准度和区分度，但不同元认知任务需要多任务训练才能获得泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在决策场景中应用日益广泛，但缺乏有效的不确定性表达机制，用户可能在不知情的情况下基于错误输出采取行动。

Method: 对两种大语言模型在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上进行监督微调，评估单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较两种元认知任务。

Result: 微调改善了模型在校准度和区分度方面的表现，在领域内外均有效，但准确率保持不变。多任务微调在跨领域评估中产生更广泛的效果。

Conclusion: LLM的不确定性表达能力是可训练和可泛化的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然相互强化，必须通过多任务训练共同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过图片描述自动评估认知语言障碍的方法往往忽略视觉叙事路径，而手动标记或基于字典的映射方法劳动密集。

Method: 使用基于BERT的流程，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，自动从Cookie Theft图片描述中提取和排序CIU，采用5折交叉验证评估。

Result: 在CIU检测中达到93%中位数精确率和96%中位数召回率，序列错误率为24%。提取的特征与真实值有强Pearson相关性，在外部验证中优于基于字典的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该流程能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未能超越最佳语言模型，降维提升了基于嵌入的线性分类器但不及语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化项目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，为大规模评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理上下文时往往忽略不同分区策略造成的信息冗余或代表性不足问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标控制块多样性，支持灵活的块选择策略，允许每个块在全局多样性和局部一致性之间调整，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模下都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过精细控制语义结构，有效解决了ICL中的上下文选择问题，显著提升了few-shot学习性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合语义搜索系统，结合词汇检索、向量相似性和LLM重排序，解决Head Start项目中员工在GoEngage平台上查找任务的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目员工在GoEngage平台上因专业术语、系统命名和搜索限制而难以定位任务模块，需要更有效的搜索解决方案。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法，结合轻量级容错词汇检索、基于嵌入的向量相似性和受限LLM重排序，利用现有基础设施并确保可信度。

Result: 提供了完整的实施框架，包括资源需求、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法。

Conclusion: 该混合搜索系统能够有效解决专业术语搜索问题，具有低误报率、可演进性和经济高效的特点。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在SFT中引入基于集合的全局损失，解决了推理路径多样性与准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展并行测试时计算时，需要生成既多样又准确的推理路径。对于复杂问题，触发多样且正确推理模式的分支标记通常位于采样树深处，传统方法如温度缩放难以平衡多样性与准确性。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在监督微调中使用自监督二分匹配，在全局分支标记和唯一推理轨迹之间建立对应关系，引入基于集合的全局损失。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下均优于传统SFT方法，能够保持独特的推理模式并产生新兴的全局分支标记。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了推理多样性与准确性的权衡问题，通过集合监督微调保留了独特的推理模式，在并行推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据比例对模型性能的影响，发现20%以下合成数据能保持稳定性能，30%以上性能加速下降，大模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性，校准退化先于准确率下降，推理任务比检索任务更易受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型的行为，为实际应用提供合成数据使用比例的指导。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上，评估模型在合成数据比例为0-50%时的性能、校准和输出特征，进行1-3次训练迭代。

Result: 模型在20%合成数据内保持稳定性能，超过30%性能加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）对合成数据更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务在合成数据训练下退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持80%以上外部数据）处于安全范围内，提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算实用指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评委，基于Torrance创造性思维测试基准，学习不同个体的细微创意判断。

Result: 该方法在各种模型规模上都优于基线监督微调方法，在皮尔逊相关性、Cohen's和F1值等指标上均有提升。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：基准测试中泄露推理路径，以及单一通过率的评估方式无法诊断失败原因。

Method: 开发了WebDetective基准测试，包含无提示的多跳问题和受控的维基百科沙盒环境，提供完整的模型行动追踪，并采用分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的整体评估框架。

Result: 评估25个最先进模型发现系统性弱点：模型在拥有足够证据时仍难以有效利用知识，在缺乏证据时几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式暴露了当前系统擅长执行给定推理路径但无法自主发现推理路径的根本差距。

Conclusion: WebDetective的诊断框架能够指导具体的架构改进，证明该基准测试是开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理的关键工具。开发的EvidenceLoop工作流程通过验证循环和系统证据追踪改善了搜索和综合能力。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Motivation: 科学文献快速增长使得文献综述难以保持全面和及时更新，现有方法主要关注检索和筛选阶段，而综述写作阶段特别是可读性和事实准确性方面研究不足。

Method: 采用多智能体协作工作流，包含内容提纲、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等专门智能体，模拟人工文献综述过程。

Result: 在SciReviewGen和ScienceDirect数据集上评估，LiRA在写作和引用质量方面优于AutoSurvey和MASS-Survey等基线方法，同时保持与人工撰写综述的竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究证明了智能体LLM工作流程的潜力，即使没有领域特定调优，也能提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

### [95] [To model human linguistic prediction, make LLMs less superhuman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05141)
*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测下一个词方面表现优于人类，但作为人类语言预测的认知模型时，其预测人类阅读行为的能力反而下降，主要原因是LLMs拥有超人类的长期和短期记忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为人类语言预测认知模型的有效性，发现随着模型预测能力的提升，其预测人类阅读行为的能力反而下降，需要研究如何创建具有人类记忆特征的模型。

Method: 分析LLMs与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别导致LLMs"超人类"表现的两个关键因素：更强的长期事实记忆和短期文本记忆能力。

Result: LLMs在预测下一个词方面远超人类，但无法准确预测人类阅读行为，因为人类处理语言时存在认知限制，而LLMs没有这些限制。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类记忆特征的模型，并指出当前人类数据不足以衡量进展，需要设计新的人类实验来填补这一空白。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流水线，从实验文献中提取47个涵盖成分、加工、微观结构和性能的特征，显著提高材料信息提取的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料科学文献中大量非结构化信息难以提取的问题，现有方法提取特征有限且未能整合成分-加工-微观结构-性能关系，难以构建全面数据库。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取流水线，结合迭代提取和来源追踪，使用大语言模型从实验报告材料中提取47个特征。

Result: 在特征级和元组级评估中F1分数约0.96，微观结构类别F1分数分别提高10.0%和13.7%，误报率为零，遗漏率从12.4%降至3.3%。

Conclusion: 该流水线实现了可扩展高效的文献挖掘，生成高精度、低遗漏的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可靠输入，模块化设计适用于多种材料类别。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SynCED-EnDe数据集，用于机器翻译中的关键错误检测，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个银标注句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，来自2024-2025年的多样化来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在限制，需要更全面和现代化的资源来推进机器翻译的安全部署。

Method: 构建了包含黄金和银标注的平衡数据集，引入了明确的错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性和充分性偏差）。

Result: 基准实验显示，与WMT21相比，XLM-R和相关编码器由于平衡标签和精细化标注而获得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe可作为社区资源，推进机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手（特别是可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景）中的安全部署。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

*Qi Li,Runpeng Yu,Haiquan Lu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用离散扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的解码机制进行模型溯源的新方法，通过提取解码轨迹中的结构信息来区分不同模型或同一模型的不同检查点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散大语言模型在非自回归语言建模中表现出色，但其解码机制不仅提升模型性能，还可用于模型溯源。现有方法直接使用模型置信度效果不佳，因为dLLMs的双向解码特性使得置信度信息冗余且结构信号被削弱。

Method: 提出Directed Decoding Map(DDM)来提取解码步骤间的结构关系，揭示模型特定行为；并设计Gaussian-Trajectory Attribution(GTA)方法，为每个目标模型的每个解码位置拟合高斯分布，通过计算轨迹的似然度作为溯源分数。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确区分不同模型以及同一模型的不同检查点。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹包含丰富的结构信息，通过DDM和GTA方法可以有效提取和利用这些信息进行模型溯源，为模型识别和验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Chronological Thinking机制，在流式语音输入过程中进行增量推理，提升全双工语音对话系统的响应质量，无需额外延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工语音对话系统在听音阶段只是重复预测静音标记，这与人类在对话中进行轻量思考的行为不符，需要改进响应质量。

Method: 提出严格因果的增量推理机制：在听音过程中基于过去音频逐步更新内部假设，无前瞻；推理时间分摊在听音窗口内，用户停止说话后立即响应。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示响应质量持续提升，能够稳健处理对话动态变化，在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: Chronological Thinking机制有效改进了全双工语音对话系统的响应质量，实现了更自然的对话交互。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 探索领域适应大语言模型在金融自然语言处理中的优势和不足，为金融相关决策过程提供有效的模型设计和评估方法。

Method: 基于PIXIU框架构建FinMA模型，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下评估模型性能。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 金融大语言模型需要针对特定任务进行优化设计，特别是在数值推理和实体识别等关键金融任务中需要进一步改进。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial
tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain
adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型对上下文示例分隔符的选择极其敏感，不同分隔符会导致模型性能波动高达±23%，甚至可以操纵模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注示例数量，但示例格式选择（如分隔符）对模型性能的影响尚未充分研究，而实际使用中用户需要选择不同的分隔符格式。

Method: 在多个主流模型家族（Llama、Qwen、Gemma）上测试不同分隔符对MMLU等任务的影响，通过注意力头得分分析机制，并探索提高鲁棒性的方法。

Result: 分隔符选择显著影响模型性能，性能波动可达±23%；好的分隔符能引导注意力到关键标记；在提示中明确指定分隔符可提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM对分隔符选择极其脆弱，这种脆弱性普遍存在且不随模型规模改善；建议在提示中明确指定分隔符，并提供了最佳分隔符的实用建议。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成大规模公共审议摘要时存在代表性不足和偏见问题，而现有的LLM评估方法与人类判断对齐度较弱，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含10个审议问题的3000名参与者意见数据，以及4500名参与者标注的摘要评估数据；基于这些数据训练DeBERTa模型DeliberationJudge来评估审议摘要。

Result: DeliberationJudge比各种LLM评估器更高效且与人类判断更一致；评估18个LLM发现审议摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数立场代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估审议摘要提供了可扩展且可靠的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于系统分类和提示工程的LLM幻觉自动检测方法，通过向量嵌入和无监督学习分析幻觉与真实回答的空间分布差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型在推理过程中产生的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性，需要开发轻量级但有效的幻觉检测框架。

Method: 通过系统分类和提示工程控制生成多种幻觉类型，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，通过无监督学习在降维表示中分析幻觉与真实回答的分布。

Result: 定量评估显示，幻觉的信息扭曲严重程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离存在一致相关性，简单分类算法即可可靠区分幻觉与准确回答。

Conclusion: 研究提供了理论和实证证据，证明即使在单个LLM内，简单分类算法也能可靠检测幻觉，为提升模型可靠性提供了轻量有效的框架。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAD（Exploratory Annealed Decoding）的探索策略，通过从高到低退火调整采样温度，在生成早期鼓励探索，后期保持利用，以平衡样本质量和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用的矛盾：高温会降低样本质量，低温会限制发现。需要一种既能保持样本质量又能确保训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD采用退火解码策略，在生成过程中从高温度逐渐降低到低温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的生成模式。

Result: EAD显著提高了样本效率，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模上都优于固定温度采样，是一个轻量级即插即用的方法。

Conclusion: 将探索策略与序列生成的自然动态对齐，是提升LLM推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于评估多语言大模型在九种亚洲语言中实体文化偏见的基准，包含19,530个手动标注的实体和2,173个自然语境，揭示了LLMs在亚洲语言中的文化适应困难、不同模型家族的独特偏见以及语境理解挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs多语言能力增强，处理文化多样性实体的能力变得关键。先前研究表明LLMs在阿拉伯语中偏向西方实体，但由于缺乏多语言基准，不清楚这种偏见是否在其他非西方语言中存在。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含9种亚洲语言的19,530个手动标注实体和2,173个社交媒体来源的掩码语境，评估4个多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都表现出文化适应困难，性能因模型开发地区对文化相关数据的访问程度而异；不同LLM家族持有独特偏见，对文化与特定情感的关联方式不同；LLMs在亚洲语言的语境理解上存在困难，导致实体抽取中的文化间性能差距。

Conclusion: 多语言LLMs在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见和适应问题，需要更好的文化敏感性和语境理解能力，Camellia基准为评估和改进这些能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保LLM系统安全成为迫切需求。外部LLM护栏模型是流行解决方案，但它们本身也容易受到数据分布变化的影响。

Method: 以RAG为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析插入良性文档到护栏上下文中的影响，并分别评估检索文档、用户查询和LLM生成响应各组件的作用。

Result: 插入良性文档会改变约11%的输入护栏和8%的输出护栏判断，测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改善。

Conclusion: 当前护栏存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会脆弱性和韧性信息，但由于规模庞大、数字化质量差和语言古老，难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案段落中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（评估LLM对社会脆弱性和韧性指标的分类能力）。

Result: 密集检索器在处理历史术语时表现不佳，LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为残差相似度(RS)的新方法，在保持可解释性的同时，通过神经网络补充基于可解释特征的系统来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者身份验证系统不仅需要高准确性，还需要可解释的解决方案。神经方法虽然准确率高，但其表示缺乏直接可解释性，且LLM预测无法忠实解释推理过程。

Method: 使用神经网络预测相似度残差，即基于可解释系统的相似度预测误差。该方法将作者身份验证视为相似性任务，通过残差学习来改进性能。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能达到最先进作者身份验证模型的性能，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释性程度。

Conclusion: 残差相似度方法能够在保持可解释性的同时，有效提升作者身份验证系统的性能，为实际应用提供了可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度在处理长上下文时成为显著瓶颈，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过系统综述和批判性分析，比较了亚二次注意力变体、RNN、状态空间模型和混合架构在计算复杂度、内存需求和基准测试结果方面的表现。

Result: 识别了各种方法在克服注意力瓶颈方面的进展和局限性，评估了它们挑战纯注意力Transformer主导地位的潜力。

Conclusion: 虽然存在多种有前景的替代方案，但纯注意力Transformer的主导地位短期内仍难以被完全取代，需要进一步研究来平衡效率和性能。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大语言模型能完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会随输入长度增加而显著下降，这表明输入长度本身是影响模型性能的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在长上下文任务中性能下降的根本原因，验证即使检索完美，模型性能是否仍受输入长度影响。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源大语言模型进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记等控制条件。

Result: 即使模型能完美检索所有相关信息，性能仍会大幅下降（13.9%-85%），且这种下降在相关证据直接放在问题前时也会出现。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害大语言模型性能，与检索质量无关。提出通过让模型先复述检索到的证据再解决问题的简单缓解策略，在RULER上使GPT-4o性能提升达4%。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且临床NLP中代表性不足。现有健康本体和心理健康资源以英语或西方文化为中心，无法充分代表印度语言中的患者痛苦表达。

Method: 使用基于图的方法构建跨语言患者压力表达图（CL-PDE），捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 该框架能够解决医疗沟通中的关键差距，为AI系统提供文化有效的表征。

Conclusion: CL-PDE框架允许在多种语言环境中开发更具包容性和以患者为中心的NLP工具，用于心理健康护理。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型与专家标准对齐，支持电子健康记录系统中的隐私保护AI辅助文档记录，减少管理负担并改善ICU患者安全

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够有效自动化结构工程中的有限元建模任务，展示了在专业工程领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Filtered Distillation框架，通过三个无监督信任指标筛选LLM生成的推理依据，用于专利分类任务，在USPTO-2M数据集上表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的推理依据常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接用作监督会传播噪声并影响训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个无监督信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，构建统一信任分数来筛选训练样本。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个利用推理感知信任指标的可靠范式，为专利分析提供了有效的监督学习框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Conclusion: 条件化用户画像的模拟器能够有效替代人类评估，可用于评估包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus和Gemini 2.5 Pro在内的18个最新LLM助手。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 图监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中表现出有效性和鲁棒性，能够捕捉不同智能体的互补优势

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Motivation: 当前大型语言和推理模型在理解对话中的复杂社交现象（如讽刺和反语）方面存在困难，需要专门的评估数据集来识别模型弱点并寻找解决方案。

Method: 构建SoNLI数据集，包含精心挑选的对话文本、推理结果、可能性分数和人工编写的解释，通过多步反事实推理来评估模型的心智理论能力。

Conclusion: SoNLI数据集为评估和改进模型的心智理论能力提供了重要工具，特别是在理解讽刺、反语等复杂社交现象方面。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

Motivation: 现代NLP模型规模庞大，但评估工具往往成为计算瓶颈，特别是在训练过程中需要高效计算逐句奖励信号时。传统BLEU实现无法满足GPU上的高效计算需求。

Method: 设计完全向量化的GPU加速BLEU计算，使用torch.unique创建紧凑的批次特定n-gram字典，避免传统哈希向量化的高内存成本，实现内存高效的计数机制。

Result: 在消费级GPU（NVIDIA T4）上获得超过13倍的加速，在数据中心级硬件（NVIDIA A100）上超过40倍加速，将显著瓶颈转化为训练循环中的可忽略部分。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU为基于强化学习的模型微调等研究领域提供了强大的加速工具，通过明确定义其作为"Token-ID BLEU"的开发用途并开源实现，推动了研究进展。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用和简化的环境规范，可能导致高估LLMs的规划能力并在下游任务中引发安全问题，需要更丰富的约束来评估真实规划能力。

Method: 在四个广泛使用的规划基准上添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义的类别，评估4个最先进推理LLMs在3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集上的表现。

Result: 约束的引入不仅使性能持续减半，还显著挑战了模型对问题复杂性和词汇转移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 现有规划基准不足以评估LLMs的真实规划能力，需要包含更丰富约束的基准来准确评估和提升LLMs在复杂环境下的规划性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文基于皮亚杰建构主义理论，提出了构建主义代理记忆(CAM)系统，通过结构化模式、灵活同化和动态适应三个特性，提升LLM处理长文档的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息过载问题，需要一种连贯的记忆模块来提升阅读理解能力。现有方法缺乏系统性设计原则。

Method: 开发CAM系统，采用增量重叠聚类算法构建结构化记忆，支持分层摘要和在线批量集成。推理时自适应探索记忆结构激活相关信息。

Result: 在问答、基于查询的摘要和声明验证等长文本理解任务中，CAM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论设计的CAM系统为LLM长文档理解提供了更稳健高效的记忆解决方案，验证了该设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

TL;DR: KEO是一个基于大语言模型的知识提取和推理框架，专门用于安全关键领域。它构建结构化知识图谱并集成到检索增强生成流程中，相比传统文本块RAG能实现更连贯的数据集级推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中需要更可靠的知识提取和推理能力，传统文本块RAG方法在全局理解和系统级洞察方面存在局限。

Method: 使用OMIn数据集构建QA基准，建立结构化知识图谱并集成到RAG流程中，评估多种本地可部署LLM，并用更强模型作为评判者。

Result: KEO显著提升了全局感知能力，能揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务中仍然有效。

Conclusion: 知识图谱增强的LLM在安全、领域特定的问答中具有前景，在高风险推理中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存内存减少70倍至60MB，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码中KV缓存的内存需求随上下文长度线性增长，成为内存瓶颈问题。现有方法要么只压缩部分组件，要么丢弃上下文信息，需要更全面的压缩方案。

Method: 采用混合压缩方法：键向量使用1位二进制草图表示，支持硬件友好的位运算注意力；值向量使用4位量化。通过轻量级微调保持性能。

Result: 在7B参数LLM上，H1B-KV将8k上下文缓存从原始4GB减少到60MB（70倍压缩）。在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（GSM8K、MMLU、HumanEval）上匹配全精度性能，在质量-字节比上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV为内存受限环境中的LLM部署提供了稳健解决方案，通过全面压缩KV缓存实现显著内存节省而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈偏好优化已成为对齐大语言模型的重要范式，但提示作为核心组件的作用尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自博弈偏好优化。

Method: 使用提示的N个采样响应的平均奖励作为难度代理，分析困难提示和简单提示在自博弈优化中的表现差异，并探索缓解困难提示负面影响的策略。

Result: 困难提示的自博弈优化性能显著低于简单提示；将困难提示纳入训练不仅无法提升整体性能，反而会导致轻微性能下降；模型容量增加时，困难提示与简单提示的性能差距会缩小。

Conclusion: 选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可以提升整体自博弈性能，提示难度与模型容量存在交互作用。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型和视觉语言模型在部署时面临的内存和计算挑战，现有压缩方法缺乏理论指导。

Method: 提出Pareto引导的奇异值分解(PGSVD)，包括层间激活压缩误差理论分析、双目标优化建模和交替最小二乘实现。

Result: 在相同压缩水平下，PGSVD相比现有方法在LLM和VLM上实现了更好的精度和推理加速。

Conclusion: PGSVD为零样本低秩压缩提供了理论保证和实用框架，有效平衡了模型压缩与性能保持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在学术论文推广中存在叙事能力有限、美学质量不足和调整能力受限的问题，难以实现高效吸引人的传播效果。

Method: 引入EvoPresent自我改进代理框架，包含PresAesth多任务强化学习美学模型，提供美学评分、缺陷调整和比较反馈，支持迭代自我改进。

Result: 构建了EvoPresent基准，包含650篇顶级AI会议论文的多模态资源和2000个幻灯片对，验证了高质量反馈对代理自我改进的重要性，以及多任务RL训练在美学感知任务中的更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 高质量反馈是代理自我改进的关键，多任务强化学习在美学感知任务中表现出更强的泛化能力，自动化生成管道在视觉设计和内容构建之间存在权衡。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放域多跳推理问题时，由于依赖固定的行动序列，难以应对需要大规模信息检索的挑战

Method: 基于关键实体构建初始节点，通过深度优先搜索和创新节点生成技术，结合历史错误路径和同层节点进行动态调整

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上达到54.47% F1分数，StrategyQA数据集上达到70.05%，分别比最佳基线提升5.03%和7.25%

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态自适应策略有效扩展搜索空间，确保推理过程系统性地收敛到准确解，展现了在增强语言代理多跳推理能力方面的潜力

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Result: 在三个长视野代理任务上，配备该规划器的执行代理超越现有方法，达到新的最优性能，训练成本降低8倍。

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种无需人工努力或额外训练数据的高效有效解决方案，显著提升了代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式属性值提取在电子商务中至关重要，但由于多维数据的复杂性和视觉-文本理解的差距，现有MLLM方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，多个MLLM智能体通过多轮辩论迭代验证和更新彼此的响应，从而改进推理性能。

Result: 在ImplicitAVE数据集上的实验表明，即使少数几轮辩论也能显著提高准确性，特别是对于初始性能较低的属性。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略有潜力解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电子商务中的隐式AVE提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知优化实现更好的模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏分解，利用校准数据集最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)方法，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，帮助大语言模型在英语中进行潜在推理，从而克服翻译障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备多语言能力，但其推理过程依赖于将非英语内容隐式翻译为英语，当翻译失败时性能急剧下降。现有的跨语言上下文学习方法主要使用单语演示，反而强化了这种翻译障碍。

Method: CSICL是一种提示策略，通过在演示和指令中控制代码转换，从目标语言逐步过渡到英语，为模型提供隐式语言桥梁，增强跨语言对齐并减少对翻译障碍的依赖。

Result: 在4个大语言模型、6个数据集和10种语言的广泛实验中，CSICL始终优于跨语言上下文学习基线，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源设置下提升更显著（目标语言14.7%，未见语言5.3%）。

Conclusion: 代码转换是一种原则性且鲁棒的方法，可在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动大语言模型朝着更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

### [135] [Adaptive and Multi-Source Entity Matching for Name Standardization of Astronomical Observation Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05744)
*Liza Fretel,Baptiste Cecconi,Laura Debisschop*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发一种生成多源天文观测设施映射的方法，使用可调标准和NLP技术比较实体，通过LLM验证映射建议，最终生成多源同义词集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为天文观测设施创建多源映射，整合来自多个语义资源（包括Wikidata和天文专业资源）的实体信息，提高数据的可发现性和互操作性。

Method: 使用可调标准计算实体相似度得分，应用多种NLP技术（词袋方法、序列方法和表面方法），利用所有可用属性，最后通过大语言模型验证映射建议。

Result: 生成了包含多源同义词集的映射，每个实体只有一个标准化标签，这些映射将用于名称解析API并集成到IVOA词汇表和OntoPortal-Astro平台。

Conclusion: 该方法成功创建了天文观测设施的多源映射，确保了映射的合理性和FAIR原则，为天文数据集成和互操作提供了重要基础。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

*Peter Ochieng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过推导非渐近谱带，建立了InfoNCE梯度范数与对齐度、温度和批次谱的关系，设计了基于有效秩的谱感知批次选择方法，并在图像分类任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比学习方法在批次选择上缺乏理论指导，无法有效利用数据谱结构来优化训练效率和性能。

Method: 提出基于有效秩的谱感知批次选择方法，包括快速贪婪构建器，并结合批次内白化技术来促进各向同性和降低梯度方差。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1精度的时间减少了15%；CIFAR-10也显示出类似增益。批次内白化将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 谱感知批次选择和批次内白化能显著提升对比学习的训练效率和性能，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

*Jianbin Shen,Christy Jie Liang,Junyu Xuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的抽象文本摘要学习方法，包含基于最优传输的信息注意力机制和命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上取得了更好的ROUGE分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要先进方法将冗长文本转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息丰富度方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 1. 基于最优传输的信息注意力方法，改进对参考摘要中关键信息的学习；2. 命名实体累积联合熵减少方法，增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争力的结果。人工评估也显示该方法在信息丰富度方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息丰富度，进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型在推理时激活的参数高度稀疏，提出MoNE方法通过神经元级专家选择，仅激活50%的MoE层参数即可达到传统MoE性能，显著提升参数利用率和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型在推理时的参数激活稀疏性，发现大多数神经元激活值接近零，这启发了选择高激活神经元专家的方法。

Method: 提出Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)，在每个专家内部进行简单的top-k选择，实现神经元级专家选择，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE仅激活50%的MoE层参数即可匹配传统MoE性能，在相同激活参数数量下始终优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

TL;DR: TKTO提出了一种无需配对数据的文本转语音偏好优化方法，通过直接针对token级单位实现细粒度对齐，显著提升了日语TTS的准确性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS偏好优化方法需要成对的良/差样本对，但这类数据在TTS输出中有限，且语句级优化无法实现细粒度的发音对齐。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单位进行优化，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提升39%，CER降低54%，为目标token自动分配12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO实现了更数据高效的训练范式，通过token级偏好优化显著改善了TTS系统的发音准确性和自然度。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Qizhou Wang,Bo Han,Jing Bai,Hinrich Schutze,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEPO通过两阶段rollout和自适应遗忘机制解决RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题，在多个推理基准上显著优于GRPO方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过度强调利用，导致熵崩溃、探索能力下降和性能提升受限。虽然增加策略随机性可以促进探索，但往往无法摆脱主导行为模式，形成自我强化的循环

Method: 提出EEPO框架，采用两阶段rollout和自适应遗忘：第一阶段生成一半轨迹，然后进行轻量级遗忘步骤暂时抑制这些采样响应，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域

Result: 在五个推理基准上，EEPO优于GRPO，在Qwen2.5-3B、Llama3.2-3B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B-Base上分别实现了24.3%、33.0%和10.4%的平均相对增益

Conclusion: EEPO的采样-遗忘机制打破了自我强化循环，在rollout过程中促进了更广泛的探索，有效解决了RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Luth是一系列专门针对法语的小型语言模型，通过针对性的后训练在精选的高质量法语数据上，在多个法语基准测试中超越了同规模的开源模型，同时保持了原有的英语能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要以英语为中心，导致其他主要语言（如法语）在性能上存在显著差距，特别是在小型语言模型方面。现有的多语言模型在法语上的表现远低于英语，且针对法语的高效适应方法研究有限。

Method: 通过针对性的后训练在精选的高质量法语数据上，并采用策略性的模型融合方法来提升双语性能。

Result: Luth模型在多个法语基准测试中超越了所有同规模的开源模型，同时保持了原有的英语能力。模型融合进一步提升了双语性能。

Conclusion: Luth为法语小型语言模型设立了新的技术标杆，并为未来的法语语言研究提供了强有力的基准。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

TL;DR: 该论文探索了使用持续预训练作为可扩展的自监督方法，来使大型语言模型适应下游摘要任务，特别是在嘈杂的真实世界对话转录场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本摘要方面表现出色，但在应用于与原始预训练分布不同的专业领域或对话数据时性能往往不足。虽然微调可以提高摘要质量，但通常依赖昂贵且稀缺的高质量标注数据。

Method: 使用大规模未标注的商业对话数据进行持续预训练，研究这种方法是否能增强模型在对话摘要中的能力。分析了数据选择策略的影响。

Result: 持续预训练在领域内和领域外摘要基准测试中都带来了显著提升，同时保持了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 持续预训练是提高LLMs在对话摘要任务中性能的有效方法，为面向摘要的工业应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了自动化合同生成器在瑞士隐私法修订背景下的合规性影响，发现使用生成器的网站合规性显著提高15个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是小型企业缺乏资源和专业知识起草复杂法律文件，而自动化合同生成器的实际效果缺乏实证证据。

Method: 创建并标注多语言基准数据集，涵盖瑞士和欧盟隐私法的关键合规义务，使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模隐私政策合规性评估。

Result: 观察到合规性提升表明法律修订的效果，18%的本地网站明确引用生成器，使用生成器的隐私政策合规性比未使用的高出15个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究结果对三个议题有贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量中的作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文去噪训练(CDT)方法，通过检测和量化上下文中的噪声信息来提升长上下文模型的注意力机制，使其更关注关键信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文模型在处理长序列时容易受到上下文噪声（无关信息）的干扰，这会误导模型的注意力机制，影响预测性能。

Method: 提出集成梯度(IG)分数来检测和量化上下文噪声，并在此基础上设计了上下文去噪训练(CDT)策略，通过强化关键标记的注意力来提升模型性能。

Result: 在四个任务上的广泛实验表明，CDT方法在上下文窗口扩展和长上下文对齐设置下都表现出优越性。使用CDT训练的8B开源模型可以达到与GPT-4o相当的性能。

Conclusion: 上下文去噪训练是一种简单而有效的训练策略，能够显著提升长上下文模型对关键信息的注意力，从而提高模型性能。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在安全关键场景下的行为，特别是在长上下文环境中对有害内容的敏感性，这是当前研究较少关注的领域

Method: 通过改变有害内容类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、占比（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000词元），在LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral等模型上评估有害内容检测性能

Result: 所有模型表现出相似模式：性能在有害内容占比25%时达到峰值；随着上下文长度增加召回率下降；开头位置的有害语句检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致

Conclusion: 研究首次系统揭示了LLMs在长上下文中如何优先处理和校准有害内容，既展示了其新兴优势，也指出了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

TL;DR: 本文批判性地重新评估了LSZ关于LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出文化特定倾向的研究，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的人工产物，而非稳定特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑LSZ关于LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出文化特定倾向的结论，认为其方法、实验设计和解释存在问题。

Method: 使用更广泛的LLMs和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，检验提示语言对输出的影响。

Result: 结果显示提示语言对输出影响极小，挑战了LLMs编码根深蒂固文化信念的说法。

Conclusion: LSZ报告的"文化倾向"是脆弱的，并非LLMs的稳定特征，提示语言本身并不能诱导显著的文化转变。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮交互中表现不佳，常常依赖错误的早期假设且无法跟踪用户目标，而对话系统中的长期规划对于处理交互任务至关重要。

Method: 提出基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈并利用经验回放进行提示重写，仅修改LLM代理的任务指令提示来实现规划能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为无参数的强化学习优化方法开辟了未来研究方向，证明了仅通过提示修改就能实现有效的多轮交互规划。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文化评估基准往往将文化简化为静态事实或同质价值观，这与人类学强调文化是动态、历史情境和实践中的观点相冲突，需要更准确的文化评估方法。

Method: 提出了四部分框架来分类基准测试如何构建文化（如知识、偏好、表现或偏见），并定性分析了20个文化基准，识别出六个常见方法问题。

Result: 识别出六个重复出现的方法问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等。

Conclusion: 建议通过融入真实世界叙事和场景、让文化社区参与设计和验证、在情境而非孤立环境中评估模型等改进措施，开发能更准确捕捉模型对复杂文化情境响应的文化基准。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐表现，特别是识别区域偏见。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和PEW全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题），结合两种评分方法和模型作为评审的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应高度对齐（WVS的Pearson's r约0.90），但发现明显的区域差异：西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61（绝对差距0.21），表明存在一致的区域偏见。同行评审标记了348个冲突。

on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型能够在其内部表征中线性建模数学问题的难度级别，通过分析最终Transformer层的特定注意力头，揭示了模型对问题难度的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否能够在内部表征中编码问题难度，这对于自适应推理和高效资源分配至关重要。

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLM最终token的表征，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头来感知难度。

Result: 证明数学问题难度可以在LLM内部表征中被线性建模，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题表现出相反的激活模式，且该定位准确。

Conclusion: LLM中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持，可大幅减少人工标注成本，并为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准，用于评估LLM在约束规划任务中的表现，发现当前最先进LLM在约束程度增加时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM主要在无约束规划任务上进行测试，而现实世界应用需要遵守约束（特别是安全约束），因此需要评估LLM在约束规划任务上的能力。

Method: 基于现有规划环境施加时间约束，然后将这些约束问题转化为自然语言交给LLM解决。LexiCon具有可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成时间约束。

Result: 实验表明，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的最先进LLM在规划任务约束程度增加时性能会下降。

Conclusion: LexiCon提供了一个可扩展的基准来系统评估LLM的约束规划能力，揭示了当前LLM在复杂约束规划任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

TL;DR: 本文通过重新评估GPT-2在寄生间隙结构上的表现，发现Wilcox等人使用的直接最小对比方法比Lan等人使用的差分方法能更清晰地揭示语言模型对填充语-间隙依赖关系的掌握。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用不同评估方法对语言模型学习复杂句法的能力得出矛盾结论，需要澄清哪种评估方法更能准确反映模型的句法能力。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列组合的寄生间隙刺激材料，使用Wilcox风格的直接最小对比方法系统评估GPT-2模型。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都成功表现出对填充语-间隙许可原则的掌握，即使在复杂的寄生间隙环境中也表现出稳健的知识。

Conclusion: 评估方法的选择对判断语言模型的句法能力至关重要，直接最小对比方法比差分方法提供更清晰的诊断信息。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A单B的LoRA改进架构，通过多专家A矩阵捕获多样化特征，解决了传统LoRA单A矩阵表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时提升下游任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法依赖单一降维矩阵A作为特征提取器，这种单一表示无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号，形成了表示瓶颈，限制了模型在下游任务中的适应能力。

Method: 提出MASA架构，采用多A单B结构：多个专家A矩阵不对称地跨层共享以捕获多样化特征，单个层特定B矩阵进行特征整合，确保参数效率。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对提升1.84%），可学习参数仅为0.52%。在多领域泛化、单领域专业化和多任务推理等实验中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: MASA通过多专家A矩阵架构有效解决了LoRA的表示瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型在下游任务中的适应能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Motivation: 近期使用大语言模型测试刺激贫乏论证的研究在不同句法现象上得出矛盾结果，作者怀疑刺激物的词汇歧义和结构复杂性可能混淆模型表现。

Method: 提出重新评估LLM句法预测能力的方法：1)在先前使用的刺激物上建立基线；2)使用最先进生成式LLM创建精炼数据集，通过语言学模板减轻已识别的混淆因素。

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在精炼刺激物上的表现相比基线显著改善。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文大语言模型面临独特挑战，主要由于中文语料库中非结构化自由文本占主导地位且缺乏结构化表示。现有基准主要是英文中心的，未能解决中文的语言特性，缺乏用于稳健评估的结构化数据集。

Method: 构建了中文数据-文本对(CDTP)数据集，包含超过700万对齐的文本对，每个文本对由非结构化文本和一个或多个对应三元组组成，总计1500万个三元组，涵盖四个关键领域。

Result: CDTP数据集丰富了中文语料库的高质量结构化信息，支持知识驱动任务的细粒度评估，并支持多任务微调以评估跨场景的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过广泛的实验和消融研究进行了严格评估，评估了基准的有效性、监督微调(SFT)和鲁棒性。提供了开源代码库，并基于研究洞察提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出ASPO方法解决LLM强化学习中token级重要性采样比率不匹配问题，通过翻转正优势token的IS比率来平衡正负token的权重更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM后训练方法在强化学习中使用token级裁剪机制，但发现OSRL范式存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制低概率token更新而过度放大高概率token。

Method: 提出非对称重要性采样策略优化(ASPO)，采用简单有效的策略翻转正优势token的IS比率，使其更新方向与负token的学习动态对齐，并引入软双重裁剪机制来稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试上的综合实验表明，ASPO显著缓解了早熟收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在强GRPO基线基础上提升了最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析为token级权重在OSRL中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中修正IS的关键重要性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

TL;DR: 语言模型后训练虽然提升了指令遵循能力和下游任务表现，但会降低模型在具有多个有效答案任务上的性能。研究发现当前后训练技术会损害模型的上下文引导能力和分布覆盖范围，为此提出了Spectrum Tuning方法来改善这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型后训练方法在提升指令遵循能力的同时，往往忽视了在具有多个有效答案任务上的性能损失。需要研究如何平衡模型的能力获取与保持分布建模的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Spectrum Suite评估资源，包含40多个数据源和90多个任务，用于评估模型的上下文引导能力。并提出了Spectrum Tuning后训练方法，使用Spectrum Suite来改善模型的引导能力和分布覆盖范围。

Result: 研究发现当前后训练技术虽然有助于激发模型的潜在能力和知识，但会损害模型的上下文引导灵活性。Spectrum Tuning方法相比预训练模型和指令调优模型，在引导能力、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐方面都有改善。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在提升指令遵循能力与保持分布建模灵活性之间取得平衡。Spectrum Tuning方法能够有效改善模型的上下文引导能力和分布覆盖范围，在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对代码推理蒸馏中模型性能随数据量扩展趋势的深入理解，需要系统研究蒸馏数据量对小型非推理LLM代码能力的影响。

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上进行代码推理蒸馏实验，研究不同数据量下的性能变化趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段进行微调以分析学习阶段特性。

Result: 发现了代码推理低谷现象：随着数据量增加，代码推理性能先下降后以超对数线性方式增长；在低中数据量阶段，简单代码问题比难题更有效；训练数据中答案的正确性对蒸馏结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，为优化蒸馏策略提供了实证基础，超越了单纯依靠直觉的方法。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

Method: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)统一框架，整合可解释性技术生成模型推理的因果图；识别了幻觉不可避免的承诺层；使用双过程理论解释联想路径与上下文路径的冲突机制。

Result: 发现上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关(ρ = -0.863)，表明幻觉是内部语义弱点的可预测后果；识别了特定的承诺层，在该层模型内部表示不可逆地偏离事实性。

Conclusion: 提供了Transformer架构中幻觉如何、何时以及为何发生的机制性解释，揭示了联想路径与上下文路径冲突导致的可预测失败模式，如推理捷径劫持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

Motivation: 现有分词方法在支持有效跨语言迁移方面存在不足，语义等价词被分配不同嵌入表示，限制了跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 训练单语分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译全面对齐词汇表，确保语义等价词具有一致的词汇索引。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练的transformer编码器，在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度等任务中，均优于传统多语言基线模型。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源环境下，并行分词器能显著提升跨语言性能。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

<details>

Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低而重复重掩码token，导致冗余迭代，限制了整体加速效果。

Method: 引入Trace Credit量化token收敛潜力，提出CreditDecoding训练免费并行解码算法，通过融合当前logits和历史Trace Credit加速正确但置信度不足token的收敛。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，且与主流推理优化正交，是一个易于集成且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

TL;DR: RoSE是一种无需人工标注即可选择最佳LLM生成器的代理指标，通过在候选LLM生成的合成数据上训练小模型并评估其性能来选择最优生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为低资源语言选择最佳LLM生成器具有挑战性，因为外部评估需要昂贵的人工标注，而内在指标与下游性能相关性差。

Method: RoSE方法：在候选生成器的输出上训练小模型，然后在所有其他候选LLM生成的合成示例上评估该模型，最终RoSE得分是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内在启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一与人类测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低比特宽度的KV缓存压缩，在2比特量化下达到接近全精度的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低比特宽度下由于键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，阻碍了代码本的有效利用，需要解决KV缓存的内存开销问题。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换来抑制键缓存中的异常值，使代码本能够全面覆盖原始数据分布，并设计融合计算与反量化的CUDA内核来最小化内存访问开销。

Result: 在2比特量化下实现与全精度相当的性能，在大批量自注意力计算中提供2.7倍加速，在单批量端到端延迟上实现8.3倍减少。

Conclusion: VecInfer在长上下文理解和数学推理任务中始终优于现有量化基线，为LLM推理提供了高效的KV缓存压缩解决方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型通过位置、词汇和自反三种机制来绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用三种机制来补偿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在上下文推理中如何绑定和检索实体，特别是当绑定实体数量增加时，原有的位置机制表现不佳，需要探索更完整的机制。

Method: 在九个模型和十个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，开发结合位置、词汇和自反三种机制的因果模型来估计下一个token分布。

Result: 发现模型一致地混合使用三种机制来驱动行为，开发的因果模型与真实分布达到95%的一致性，并能推广到更长的开放文本输入。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了三种机制的混合使用模式及其在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有方法大多采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的实际工作流程。

Method: 构建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次；提出ReCodeAgent框架，将反馈集成到迭代代码生成中。

Result: 实验显示，使用更丰富的反馈可以显著提升GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-V3.1和Gemini 2.5等领先LLM的性能。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为开发科学研究实现中的自适应、反馈驱动的LLM代理奠定了基础，但复杂研究代码生成仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing
adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation

TL;DR: BanglaTalk是首个针对孟加拉语方言的实时语音助手系统，采用客户端-服务器架构和RTP协议实现低延迟通信，通过方言感知ASR系统BRDialect在10种方言上优化性能，在低带宽下保持4.9秒端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言且方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准语，需要开发支持方言的实时语音助手来改善信息可访问性。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构和RTP协议；开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，通过在10种孟加拉语方言上微调IndicWav2Vec模型来处理方言变异。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: BanglaTalk通过低带宽使用和最小化端到端延迟，实现了成本效益和交互性，为多样化的孟加拉语使用者群体提供了包容和可访问的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST模型通过将语音token动态聚合成潜在语音片段，解决了语音-文本模型中语音序列过长导致的训练和推理效率问题，在语音和文本任务上都取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归语音-文本模型中语音token序列远长于文本token导致的训练计算不平衡、推理效率低以及模态对齐效果不佳的问题。

Method: 提出潜在语音-文本变换器(LST)，通过动态且低成本地将语音token聚合成潜在语音片段，这些片段可以作为更高级别的单元与文本单元对齐或封装常见语音序列。

Result: LST在语音到语音和文本到文本基准测试中均优于传统方法，在HellaSwag故事补全任务中，语音准确率在计算控制训练下提升6.5%，在数据控制训练下提升5.3%，同时文本性能也得到改善。

Conclusion: LST通过语音token聚合机制提高了语音-文本模型的数据效率和计算效率，实现了更有效的表征对齐和更陡峭的缩放规律。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取中语言解释缺乏监督的问题，通过促进包含重要关系关键词的输出来增强可解释性

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1) 受认知科学启发的文本处理步骤推理机制；(2) 使用新颖奖励函数的强化学习优化过程，该奖励函数旨在同时提升任务准确性和解释质量

Result: 在One-shot NYT29数据集上，Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct模型达到24.65% F1，超越先前基于推理的设计；RL优化后性能绝对提升23.46%；人类评估显示解释质量相对提升54%

Conclusion: CogRE框架通过认知结构化推理和强化学习优化，有效解决了少样本关系抽取中的注意力聚焦不足和少样本学习能力有限的问题，显著提升了性能和可解释性

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在空气质量数据集上表现出优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要可解释性和公平性来建立信任、满足伦理要求和法规遵从。传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，而事后可解释AI技术往往牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察。

Method: 结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类，开发了一个增强可解释性和公平性的框架。包括类型2模糊聚类方法、公平性度量机制、基于规则的固有可解释AI组件，以及可扩展性评估。

Result: 在UCI空气质量数据集上，框架有效处理噪声传感器数据的不确定性，生成语言规则，使用轮廓系数和熵评估公平性。类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法提升约4%的凝聚度（轮廓系数0.365 vs. 0.349），改善公平性（熵0.918），规则覆盖率达0.65，运行时呈线性（约0.005秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，实现了4%的轮廓系数提升，公平性熵降低达1%，证明了框架在大数据环境中的有效性。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Motivation: Transformer模型在金融应用中日益流行，但其风险决策和偏见尚未充分探索，需要审计模型对波动数据的依赖程度。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并基于部分信息分解(PID)引入度量指标来衡量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析发现两个关键观察：模型完全忽视数据波动性，且偏向低频价格变动数据。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融预测中存在对数据波动性忽视和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步关注和改进。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Conclusion: 该环境适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化以及向真实网络安全场景的迁移学习，提供了完整的实现细节和可复现配置。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于代理的优化(SBO)方法只能收敛到单一最优解，限制了设计空间探索并忽略了可能有价值的替代拓扑结构。

Method: 采用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)框架，学习系统设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，能够根据特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能候选设计组合。

Result: CVAE框架成功生成了256个新颖设计，有效率为94.1%。评估显示77.2%的有效设计比SBO基线的单一最优设计性能更优。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选组合，通过支持多标准决策从根本上增强了工程设计过程。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而更复杂的QIF神经元具有更丰富的非线性动力学特性，但由于训练不稳定而应用受限。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，从离散化参数集中推导出分析性的替代梯度窗口公式，以最小化梯度不匹配问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该QIF神经元离散化方法为深度SNNs提供了一个有吸引力的LIF替代方案，结合了更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建学习丰富表示，在真实世界数据分布偏移下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标注数据短缺限制了通用模型的开发。现有自监督学习方法无法有效处理隐私友好数据（特征较少且噪声多）的挑战。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架：1）首先使用对比学习捕获片段间高层相似性；2）然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，学习片段内细粒度充电模式和片段间关联关系。

Result: 模型在制造商和老化引起的分布偏移等挑战性场景下，测试误差比最佳基准方法降低31.9%，表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从隐私友好、特征较少的数据中学习丰富表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案，在真实世界数据分布偏移下具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种针对LLM中KV缓存的模式对齐残差量化方案，通过挖掘模式向量、对齐KV向量并量化残差，显著提升了低比特KV量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为LLM推理时的内存和带宽瓶颈，传统量化方法因KV分布不平坦导致低比特设置下精度急剧下降，现有方法仅隔离异常值但未能有效平坦化整体分布。

Method: 提出PatternKV方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分，从而重塑KV分布、平坦化量化目标并缩小范围。

Result: 在长上下文和测试时扩展设置下，PatternKV实现一致的2比特增益，4比特相对FP16仅下降0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提升10%，吞吐量提高1.4倍并支持1.25倍更大批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过模式对齐残差量化有效解决了KV缓存量化问题，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理效率和扩展能力。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

TL;DR: 提出逻辑门控算子(LGO)，在符号回归中实现可学习的阈值和条件逻辑，生成具有明确、单位感知阈值的紧凑符号方程，便于临床审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了其在需要明确阈值和条件判断的领域(如医疗)的应用。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，包含可学习的位置和陡度参数，通过硬门控变体实现紧凑的阈值检测，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集(ICU、NHANES)上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的切点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，同时使用更少的门控(ICU中位数4.0 vs 10.0)，保持与强基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的机制切换计算，支持治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS方法适合在真实IoT环境中部署，能够有效平衡检测性能和能源效率。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Motivation: 传统源分离方法依赖简化的源模型，无法准确复现数据。扩散模型能够直接从噪声、不完整数据中学习复杂先验分布，为解决源分离问题提供了新思路。

Method: 利用扩散模型，仅基于多视图观测数据（不同观测包含未知源的不同线性变换）进行源分离，无需对源进行显式假设。

Result: 该方法在源未被单独观测、观测数据存在噪声、不完整且分辨率变化的情况下仍能成功分离源，并能从源先验中采样、评估候选源概率、从给定观测的源分布联合后验中采样。

Conclusion: 该方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现出有效性，为源分离问题提供了一种无需显式源假设的解决方案。

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵的分布特性，测试高斯矩阵模型在表示权重分布方面的有效性，特别是在训练过程中超越简单独立同分布假设的情况。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模权重矩阵的相关高斯性，计算Wasserstein距离量化分布变化，测试不同初始化策略、正则化、层深度和宽度的影响。

Result: 置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效捕捉权重矩阵的相关高斯性，适用范围远超初始化阶段；表示论参数和图论特征提供了可解释的框架；Wasserstein距离成功量化了训练过程中的分布变化。

Conclusion: 高斯矩阵模型为神经网络权重分布提供了有效的建模框架，能够捕捉训练过程中的分布演变，并为开发更通用且可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Motivation: 现有研究假设参数完全已知或预先估计，但实际中参数需要从数据中学习。本文旨在将优化和学习整合到统一框架中，处理更灵活的问题类别。

Method: 提出了两种算法：1) 直接将参数估计值代入原始对偶更新的朴素扩展方法；2) 通过调整动量更新显式考虑参数动态的学习感知变体方法。后者还采用了回溯策略实现自适应步长选择。

Result: 两种方法都实现了O(log K/K)的可证明收敛速率，学习感知方法获得了更紧的O(1)常数，并在结构化设置下扩展到O(1/√K)速率。在误设投资组合优化问题上的实验显示优于现有算法的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的学习感知APD方法能有效处理参数误设的鞍点问题，在理论和实证上都表现出色，为同时进行优化和学习的统一框架提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Motivation: 计算神经网络Lipschitz常数是NP难问题，现有方法需要求解大型半定规划，计算复杂度高且难以扩展到大型网络。同时，利用输入区域的局部信息可以产生更紧的Lipschitz估计。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅计算效率高，而且Lipschitz估计与网络鲁棒性紧密相关，为神经网络鲁棒性认证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但现有跨模态适应方法主要关注编码器专用模型。本文旨在研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 进行了一系列消融实验，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的跨模态适应表现。提出了两种新方法：并行翻转和序列加倍，试图在自回归模型中模拟双向性。

Result: 发现当现有方法未修改时，解码器专用模型表现远差于编码器专用模型。与多个其他领域不同，扩展解码器模型也无帮助。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和所有跨模型适应方法中都提高了解码器专用模型的整体性能，缩小了与编码器模型性能的差距。

Conclusion: 本文的研究发现拓宽了用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，进一步推动了科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与transformer结合，但将目标从最大化累积奖励改为最大化动作似然，这带来了轨迹拼接和动作外推两个关键挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定。

Method: 提出Action Gradient (AG)方法，利用动作对Q值的梯度来优化动作，实现与策略梯度类似的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法能显著提升DT-based算法的性能，部分结果达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: AG方法通过直接调整动作来优化Q值，有效解决了DT在离线强化学习中的关键挑战，实现了稳定的性能提升。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

Method: 通过计算与深度神经网络相关的符号图的挫折水平，将其与零模型进行比较，从统计物理学角度分析网络中的无序程度。

Result: 所有考虑的预训练深度卷积神经网络的挫折水平都低于零模型预期，表明网络编码的无序程度较低，功能行为接近单调。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比零模型更有序的行为，这暗示了一种新的隐式正则化机制，网络在学习过程中自然地趋向于结构平衡状态。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

TL;DR: 本文提出DP-Adam-AC优化器，通过差分隐私技术增强本地化语言模型的安全性，解决传统LLM的网络安全和数据隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM存在两个安全问题：硬件要求高无法本地运行（需网络连接易受攻击），以及微调敏感任务时可能泄露训练数据。

Method: 改进差分隐私优化算法，提出DP-Adam-AC优化器，包含自适应梯度裁剪等工程增强，用于微调本地化LLM（小语言模型和1.58位量化模型）。

Conclusion: 通过差分隐私优化算法增强本地化语言模型，能够有效解决LLM的安全性和隐私问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: 句子Transformer嵌入的余弦相似度具有伽马混合分布特性，提出的EM算法为相似度分布建模提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化强制输出分布过度均匀化，限制了鲁棒性表现。

Method: 提出两种正则化策略：1）加权对抗互正则化，使用分解的对抗互KL散度损失；2）对抗泛化正则化，在对抗训练目标中引入干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法相比现有正则化方法显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门的正则化策略，可以有效解决对抗训练中的优化限制问题，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代传感系统产生高维张量数据，需要既保持张量几何结构又能捕捉非线性交互的回归模型，现有方法要么过于线性要么丢弃空间结构

Method: 开发了TRNN模型，统一张量回归和神经网络范式，在保持张量结构的同时实现非线性建模

Result: 该方法能够有效处理高维张量数据，同时保持几何结构和捕捉非线性关系

Conclusion: TRNN成功融合了张量几何保持和非线性建模能力，为高维张量数据回归提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

*Hyung Gyu Rho*

TL;DR: MADPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过实例级自适应权重解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO的固定温度参数在处理多样化偏好数据时会导致次优训练，容易对简单样本过拟合，对信息丰富样本学习不足。现有方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本的DPO损失应用连续自适应权重，对困难样本放大、简单样本抑制学习信号。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在所有数据集上一致且显著优于基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达33.3%，在低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化景观和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖迭代数值方法解决非线性无力场问题，需要开发能够直接从2D边界条件学习3D磁场结构的更高效方法。

Method: 结合高效通道注意力机制和扩张卷积，增强模型捕捉多模态输入的能力；在训练过程中应用物理信息损失，强制满足无力场和无散度条件。

Result: 在ISEE NLFFF数据集上的实验表明，PIANO在准确性上优于最先进的神经算子，并在各种太阳活动区重建的磁场中显示出与NLFFF数据物理特性的强一致性。

Conclusion: PIANO为太阳物理中的非线性无力场问题提供了一种准确且物理一致的解决方案，超越了传统方法和现有神经算子。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MT-DAO优化器，通过多时间尺度的动量机制解决分布式训练中不频繁通信策略的性能下降问题，在语言模型预训练中消除与DDP的性能差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中频繁的梯度通信会占用带宽，不频繁通信策略（如Local SGD）在自适应优化器上存在性能差距，这源于优化器动量与更新频率的时间尺度不匹配

Method: MT-DAO优化器采用多个慢速和快速移动的一阶动量或梯度，在不同时间尺度上跟踪更新动态，并提供了首个收敛保证

Result: 在语言模型预训练中消除了与DDP的性能差距，在以太网互连上减少6-27%的等token训练时间；在720M规模上，达到目标困惑度所需的步骤减少24%，时间减少35%

Conclusion: MT-DAO实现了有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围的训练

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

TL;DR: KVLinC是一个通过Hadamard旋转和线性校正适配器来减轻KV缓存量化误差的框架，在极低精度下保持生成质量的同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩和更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化是提高大语言模型推理效率的有效策略，但激进的低精度量化（如2位）会引入显著误差，通过注意力机制传播并降低生成质量。

Method: 结合Hadamard旋转（减少值量化误差）和轻量级线性校正适配器（补偿量化键引入的误差），并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的广泛评估显示，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC框架有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化中的注意力误差问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率和长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决PINNSformer架构中的两个关键问题：编码器冗余导致的参数增加，以及频谱偏差对多尺度行为建模的限制。

Method: 重新设计PINNSformer架构，移除不必要的编码器，仅依赖自注意力机制捕获时空相关性，并集成傅里叶特征嵌入来显式缓解频谱偏差。

Result: S-Pformer在所有基准测试中优于编码器-解码器PINNSformer架构，达到或超过MLP性能，同时显著减少参数数量。

Conclusion: 通过消除编码器冗余和集成傅里叶特征嵌入，S-Pformer提供了一种更高效的PINN架构，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征神经网络方法能够有效估计KL散度，并提供了可证明的误差界限。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统构成重大辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，采用4折分层交叉验证，比较不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始通量数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs单次预测。

Result: 单次预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑数据缩小了差距；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据训练模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，单次预测策略和适当的数据预处理能显著提升预测精度，模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

Conclusion: 利用模型曲率信息可以有效改进差分隐私训练中的噪声相关性，提高DP-SGD的精度表现

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

TL;DR: 本文综述了物理信息机器学习在生物医学领域的三大框架：PINNs、NODEs和NOs，强调它们在物理可解释性、数据稀缺和系统复杂性方面的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在生物医学建模中存在局限性，需要整合物理定律与数据驱动方法来解决物理可解释性、数据稀缺和复杂系统建模的挑战。

Method: 回顾三类PIML框架：物理信息神经网络（PINNs）嵌入控制方程，神经常微分方程（NODEs）提供连续时间建模，神经算子（NOs）学习函数空间映射。

Result: 这些方法已成功应用于生物固体/流体力学、机械生物学、医学成像、生理系统动力学、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等多个生物医学领域。

Conclusion: PIML在生物医学领域具有广阔前景，未来需要解决不确定性量化、泛化能力以及与大型语言模型集成等开放挑战。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手工制作的攻击模式数据集，缺乏多样性，使代理容易受到新型提示注入攻击。

Method: 使用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者LLM生成多样化提示注入和代理LLM防御这些攻击。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗性过程生成了多样化且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生了更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究元强化学习，提出两种基于随机值函数的Thompson风格算法MTSRL和MTSRL⁺，通过学习最优动作值函数的线性表示来改进任务间的知识迁移，并提供了元遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限时域MDP中，相关任务的最优动作值函数具有相似结构，通过线性表示和高斯元先验来建模任务间的关系，旨在提高元强化学习的效率。

Method: 提出MTSRL（仅学习先验均值）和MTSRL⁺（额外估计协方差并使用先验扩展）两种算法，采用先验对齐技术将学习到的后验与知道真实先验的元预言机耦合。

Result: 在已知协方差情况下获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√ANK)元遗憾，在学习协方差情况下获得Õ(H⁴S³/²√AN³K)元遗憾，当任务数量足够多时优于先验无关方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元遗憾保证的工作，在实验丰富的环境中提供了实用的算法配方。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测精度和不确定性量化方面表现优异，可作为有效的洪水早期预警系统。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来降低大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，在服务器-客户端分布式训练中面临通信效率和计算开销的挑战，特别是在低资源设备上的协作训练。

Method: 采用参数高效的分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征和层重要性通过比特正则化在通道间分配比特预算，渐进式压缩激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B模型上实现约2.5%的生成准确率提升和1.3%的分类准确率提升，显著提高训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以适度的通信开销提供优越的推理准确率，是实现最小通信成本协作训练的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ATOM（原子分子变换算子），一种用于多任务分子动力学的预训练变换器神经算子，通过准等变设计和时间注意力机制，实现了对多个未来状态的准确并行解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子动力学模拟方法通常强制严格等变性、依赖顺序展开，限制了灵活性和模拟效率，且多为单任务训练，无法泛化到未见化合物和扩展时间步。

Method: 采用准等变设计，无需显式分子图，使用时间注意力机制，在TG80数据集上进行多任务预训练，该数据集包含80种化合物的250万飞秒轨迹。

Result: 在MD17、RMD17和MD22等基准测试中达到最先进性能，在TG80多任务预训练后，对未见分子在不同时间范围内表现出优异的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Motivation: 传统的基于小规模局部迭代更新的优化方法存在效率限制，作者希望开发一种能够实现精确、非迭代收敛的优化范式。

Method: 引入无限下降法，通过解析重求泰勒展开来获得精确的代数更新方程，并提出了AION架构来满足无限下降法所需的代数闭包要求。

Result: 在简单测试问题中，AION模型通过单次下降步骤达到最优解，证明了该方法能够实现精确的非迭代收敛。

Conclusion: 无限下降法为开发非迭代学习提供了新途径，定义了一类半解析可优化模型——无限类，并讨论了该类成员的充分条件。

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

TL;DR: 提出了NorMuon优化器，结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率，解决了Muon优化器中神经元更新不平衡的问题，在大规模语言模型训练中显著提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但其更新存在神经元范数高度不均匀的问题，导致某些神经元主导优化过程。目前尚未系统探索如何结合Muon和Adam的优势。

Method: 开发了NorMuon优化器，为每个神经元维护二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行级归一化，确保参数利用平衡同时保留Muon的条件改善优势。在FSDP2框架下实现了高效的分布式实现。

Result: 在多模型规模实验中，NorMuon一致优于Adam和Muon，在11亿参数预训练设置中比Adam提升21.74%训练效率，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，这为大尺度深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

TL;DR: 提出MIDT-ECG方法，通过时频域监督和多模态人口统计条件化，解决现有生成式ECG模型形态保真度不足和无法生成个性化信号的问题，在PTB-XL数据集上验证了其高保真度、临床一致性和隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在心脏护理中的应用因患者ECG数据的隐私限制而受阻，现有生成式AI方法在可信度和临床实用性方面存在不足，特别是形态保真度不够且无法生成个性化生理信号。

Method: 基于条件扩散的结构化状态空间模型(SSSD-ECG)，提出MIDT-ECG训练范式，使用时频域监督确保生理结构真实性，并结合多模态人口统计条件化实现患者特异性合成。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，MIDT-ECG显著提升形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提高4-8%，导联间相关误差平均降低74%，在低数据情况下，使用合成ECG训练的分类器性能接近仅使用真实数据的分类器。

Conclusion: 采用时频结构正则化训练的ECG合成器可作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代方案，在真实数据稀缺时推动生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出色，但其在周期性、对称性约束环境下的表达能力仍未被充分理解，需要从计算复杂性角度进行系统分析。

Conclusion: 将EGNNs定位在TC^0复杂度类中，为对称感知的晶体系统图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并指明了超越该计算能力所需的架构改进方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖患者自述或非特异性心电图生命体征，导致危重、镇静和认知障碍患者面临疼痛治疗不足和鸦片类药物过度使用的风险。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人在三种激光诱发疼痛强度下的EEG数据，将4秒时段转换为537维特征向量，评估9种传统机器学习模型，采用留一交叉验证。

Result: 支持向量机(RBF核)获得最佳离线性能，准确率88.9%，推理时间小于1毫秒；实时XGBoost模型端到端延迟约4毫秒，准确率94.2%。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中技术上可行，为临床验证提供了途径，特征重要性分析与经典疼痛生理学一致。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，同时解决偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和模型冗长性偏见三个关键问题，在理论和实验上都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法存在三个主要问题：偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和模型冗长性偏见。大多数现有工作只解决其中一个问题，少数需要大量计算来估计多个奖励模型且缺乏泛化能力理论保证。

Method: 提出了RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，在离线和在线设置中同时缓解这三个问题。DPO-COV算法无需奖励估计，实现简单，且被证明与RLHF-COV算法等价。

Result: 理论分析表明DPO-COV算法在污染数据上训练时获得了长度正则化的泛化误差率，与干净数据和无长度正则化的最佳已知速率匹配。实验证明了DPO-COV在离线和在线设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法能够同时解决RLHF和DPO训练中的三个关键问题，具有理论保证和实际有效性，且证明了原始RLHF和DPO算法的等价性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图函数模型需要大图进行准确估计，但实践中通常只能获得小规模网络。迁移学习框架可以利用相关大源图的结构信息来改进小目标图的估计。

Method: GTRANS方法整合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，并包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差。

Result: 提供了估计对齐矩阵稳定性的理论保证，通过大量合成和真实数据实验证明GTRANS能有效提高目标图估计精度，并改善下游应用如图分类和链接预测的性能。

Conclusion: GTRANS是一个有效的迁移学习框架，能够通过结构对齐和自适应去偏机制在小目标图中实现更准确的图函数估计，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

*Lawrence Liu,Alexander Liu,Mengdi Wang,Tuo Zhao,Lin F. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵，在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著优于现有2:4剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临巨大计算和内存需求挑战，现有2:4稀疏剪枝方法往往导致显著的性能下降，需要一种更有效的模型压缩方法。

Method: ARMOR将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个块对角矩阵包装器，这些包装器作为高效的预变换和后变换误差校正器。通过块坐标下降算法选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器，最小化层间代理损失。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型系列上的实验表明，ARMOR在各种下游任务和困惑度评估中持续显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，为大型语言模型的实用硬件加速提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布变化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法如Tent存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性数据损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失曲面上过于确定的更新。

Method: 提出Langevin锚定测试时自适应(LATTA)，包含两个关键机制：(1)受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动，用于探索局部参数空间并逃离不良局部最小值；(2)稳定权重锚点，防止模型偏离其鲁棒的源预训练。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，LATTA显著优于现有方法，包括Tent、CoTTA和EATA，在CIFAR-10-C上平均准确率提高超过2%，同时降低性能方差，创下自监督TTA的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: LATTA通过结合噪声探索和稳定锚定，实现了有效且稳定的测试时自适应，无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛采样，为分布变化下的模型适应提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种联邦学习环境下的隐私保护特征选择框架，通过知识融合和样本感知权重策略解决数据异构性和隐私约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互且不适应分布式场景。在联邦学习中，本地客户端数据高度不平衡、异构且受隐私限制，需要在不暴露敏感信息的情况下整合特征选择知识。

Method: 1) 开发隐私保护知识融合策略，在不共享原始数据的情况下构建统一表示空间；2) 引入样本感知权重策略，处理异构本地客户端的分布不平衡问题。

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了联邦学习环境下的特征选择挑战，通过隐私保护机制和分布平衡策略实现了跨客户端的知识整合。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

*Shi Chen,Zhengjiang Lin,Yury Polyanskiy,Philippe Rigollet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力缩放对大型语言模型长上下文处理的重要性，发现存在相变现象：缩放不足会导致token过度聚集，缩放过度则使注意力退化为恒等变换。临界缩放因子为β_n ∝ log n。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现rank-collapse问题——注意力分数随上下文长度增加而趋于均匀，导致token过度聚集。虽然注意力缩放方法通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来应对这一问题，但缺乏理论依据。

Method: 构建了一个简化但可处理的模型来放大注意力缩放效应，分析注意力在不同缩放因子下的行为特征。

Result: 发现注意力存在相变现象：缩放不足时所有token聚集到单一方向，缩放过度时注意力退化为恒等变换，失去token间有意义的交互。确定了临界缩放因子β_n ∝ log n。

Conclusion: 为YaRN和Qwen中的注意力缩放提供了严格理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力机制。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Conclusion: GDGM框架能有效检测复杂的合谋欺骗行为，具有实际应用价值和优越性能。

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现实应用中许多图是时间演化的，但现有图生成器主要关注静态图，忽略了时间信息。基于学习的方法存在训练效率低或生成速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出时间图自编码器(TGAE)，使用基于注意力的图编码器在采样的自我图上编码时间和结构特征，以及自我图解码器实现高效生成。

Result: 在真实和合成时间图上的实验表明，TGAE在模拟质量和效率方面优于最先进的时间图生成器。

Conclusion: TGAE方法能够有效模拟时间图的结构和时间特性，在质量和效率方面表现优异。

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的协作学习方法Ours，通过共享具有差分隐私保护的嵌入（激活）而非模型权重，在保证隐私的同时提高资源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作学习基于共享模型权重，但共享嵌入（激活）在资源效率方面更有优势。目前已有针对权重共享的差分隐私方法，但缺乏针对嵌入共享的隐私保护机制。

Method: 设计隐私编码网络和小的实用生成网络，使生成的嵌入具有正式差分隐私保证。这些私有化嵌入与更强大的服务器共享，服务器学习后处理以提高机器学习任务的准确性。

Result: 该方法只需一轮私有化通信，客户端计算量少于传统方法。共享的私有化嵌入与服务器使用的模型类型无关（深度学习、随机森林或XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效、隐私保护的嵌入共享方案，支持多种服务器模型类型。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆敏感数据，导致严重的隐私泄露风险，需要更有效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 提出InfoRMIA方法，基于信息论原理构建成员推理攻击框架，并扩展到token级别的隐私分析。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中一致优于现有RMIA方法，同时提供更好的计算效率，token级别的分析能精确定位记忆的token。

Conclusion: InfoRMIA为LLM隐私风险评估提供了更有效的方法，token级别的分析视角能实现更精准的隐私泄露定位和针对性缓解措施。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

Method: 基于HydraGNN构建统一可复现基准框架，支持四种模型类别的无缝切换：MPNN、带编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力混合的GPS风格模型、带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。使用七个开源数据集进行回归和分类任务基准测试。

Conclusion: 建立了全局注意力在原子级图学习中的首个受控评估，为未来模型开发提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

Motivation: 研究深度学习的可预测性基本限制，理解其优化过程的不可重复性根源。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动态和对称性诱导的不变子空间，推导出碎形吸引盆出现的充分条件。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的碎形结构，不确定性指数接近零，初始条件精度的提高对结果可预测性改善有限。

Conclusion: 碎形几何结构对深度学习训练的可预测性和可重复性施加了基本限制，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for

*Salah Eddine Choutri,Prajwal Chauhan,Othmane Mazhar,Saif Eddin Jabari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种基于蒙特卡罗方法的神经算子框架，用于学习一维偏微分方程的解算子，通过直接学习核函数并使用蒙特卡罗方法逼近积分算子，不依赖谱表示或平移不变性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶神经算子(FNO)依赖谱表示并假设平移不变核，限制了其应用范围。MCNO旨在提供一种不依赖这些假设的替代方法，通过蒙特卡罗积分来构建更灵活的神经算子框架。

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，在离散网格上均匀随机采样一次，使用蒙特卡罗方法逼近积分算子，并通过插值步骤在不同网格间映射以增强灵活性。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中，MCNO实现了具有竞争力的精度和高效的计算成本。理论分析证明蒙特卡罗估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE的神经算子框架提供了一种理论支持的蒙特卡罗积分方法，可作为谱方法(如FNO)和图基蒙特卡罗方法(如GNO)的替代方案，并有望自然扩展到高维问题。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

*Alexander Murphy,Michal Danilowski,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Abhirup Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种超参数免费、计算成本低的测试时自适应方法，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入来改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法通常计算昂贵、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，基于潜在空间几何理论，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入可以显著改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐。

Method: NEO方法基于潜在空间几何理论，将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点，无需超参数调整，计算成本与标准推理相当。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上将ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升到59.2%，在512个样本上优于7种TTA方法，在Raspberry Pi和Jetson Orin Nano上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于多种ViT架构和数据集，计算成本低且性能优越。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)和SIS正则化方法，用于在概念侧信道模型中平衡准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过引入侧信道来提高准确性，但牺牲了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入SIS指标量化侧信道依赖度，并提出SIS正则化来显式惩罚侧信道依赖。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的CSMs可解释性较低，而SIS正则化显著提高了可解释性、可干预性和学习到的可解释任务预测器质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

*Félix Vandervorst,Bruno Deprez,Wouter Verbeke,Tim Verdonck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，用于异构动态图上的监督学习，在保险欺诈检测中表现出色，并能通过可解释性方法分析预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图方法在机器学习中越来越受欢迎，但保险欺诈检测面临类别不平衡、图异构性和动态性的挑战，导致基于表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位。

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，结合图结构和梯度提升技术，处理异构动态图的监督学习问题。

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和真实专有数据集的保险欺诈检测中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: G-GBM为保险欺诈检测提供了有效的图学习方法，同时保持了梯度提升模型的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了QuantumGraphLIME（QGraphLIME），一个模型无关的后处理框架，用于解释量子图神经网络，通过处理模型解释作为在结构保持扰动上拟合的局部代理模型的分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子图神经网络在图结构数据学习方面具有强大能力，但其可解释性受到测量诱导的随机性和图结构组合性质的复杂化。

Method: QGraphLIME通过聚合代理归因及其离散度，为量子图模型产生不确定性感知的节点和边重要性排名。该框架提供了无分布、有限样本保证的代理集成规模，使用Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz边界确保在标准独立性假设下目标精度和置信度的二元类概率诱导分布的一致近似。

Result: 在具有已知真实值的受控合成图上的实证研究展示了准确和稳定的解释，消融实验显示了非线性代理建模的明显优势，并突出了对扰动设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了一个原则性、不确定性感知和结构敏感的方法来解释量子图神经网络，并为扩展到更广泛的架构和真实世界数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

*Aditya Desai,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Shuo Yang,Alejandro Cuadron,Luis Gaspar Schroeder,Matei Zaharia,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε,δ)近似精度保证，在保持模型质量的同时实现高达20倍的稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力方法（近似top-k和采样估计）在近似全注意力时存在根本限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 基于top-k和随机采样的互补性观察，结合两者的优势并利用采样的统计保证，开发了具有(ε,δ)精度保证的vAttention稀疏注意力机制。

Result: vAttention显著提升了稀疏注意力质量（如Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响模型质量（如AIME2024上10倍稀疏度达到全模型质量）。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，通过统一top-k和采样，提供了优于单独方法的性能，是向大规模实用可靠稀疏注意力部署迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对偶DPO方法来解决LLMs的安全对齐问题，在最大化输出奖励的同时限制不安全内容的成本低于阈值，显著降低了内存和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs安全对齐方法要么需要训练奖励和成本模型导致高成本，要么需要关于最优解的先验知识。本文旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 提出原始对偶DPO方法：先用标准DPO训练模型提供奖励信息，然后使用重排的拉格朗日DPO目标在成本偏好数据上微调LLMs。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上的实验结果表明该方法有效，显著降低了内存和计算成本，且无需额外先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的安全对齐提供了一种高效实用的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的序列解缠方法依赖多个损失项使优化复杂，且缺乏对真实世界数据的评估协议。扩散模型虽是最先进的生成模型，但尚未理论形式化应用于序列解缠

Result: 在多种真实世界基准测试中，DiffSDA在序列解缠方面优于最新的最先进方法

Conclusion: DiffSDA为序列解缠提供了有效的模态无关解决方案，并在真实世界数据上表现出优越性能

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和模式挖掘，能够有效揭示数据内在结构相关性，并在不同场景下展现出更好的适应性。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度方法，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化生成样本与数据分布的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于选择哪个位置进行去掩码，传统基于规则的调度方法（如最大置信度、最大边界）只能提供临时改进，需要更智能的调度策略。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，优化一个具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习到的策略始终优于最大置信度方法，特别是在SUDOKU任务中，相比随机调度提升20.1%，相比最大置信度提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，在需要关键去掩码顺序的任务中表现显著优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Method: 采用4玩家猎鹿游戏测试直接通信效果，使用迭代公共物品惩罚游戏评估课程学习方法，包括渐进复杂游戏的教学课程。

Result: 单字"廉价对话"通信显著提升合作率(0%→48.3%)；课程学习反而降低收益27.4%，可能引发"习得性悲观"。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比经验训练更可靠；社会困境的课程设计需谨慎考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

### [239] [Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750)
*Xiao Yang,Xuejiao Zhao,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过因果分析框架系统评估了异质图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异质信息通过提高同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然HGNNs在节点分类中取得了显著成功，但其内在有效性尚未得到充分检验。大多数研究隐含假设而非证实其有效性，因此需要从模型架构和异质信息两个角度进行系统评估。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数重新调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证稳健性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果效应；异质信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异质信息而非模型架构，这为未来研究提供了重要启示：应更关注异质信息的有效利用而非复杂的模型设计。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习场景下的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 在迁移学习设置下比较多种成员推理攻击的性能，包括基于分数的MIA、似然比攻击(LiRA)和逆海森攻击(IHA)，分析不同数据量下的攻击效果。

Result: 攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险；LiRA在多数实验场景中表现最佳；在高数据量下，IHA对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要多种攻击方法的组合，LiRA是通用性最好的攻击方法，但在特定场景下其他攻击方法可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

Motivation: SNP数据集在遗传研究中至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险。现有隐私保护方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和公开数据集来抑制或选择性共享SNPs。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型(TIHMMs)生成合成SNP序列数据集，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保证，直接处理SNP内在相关性带来的隐私风险。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私预算ε∈[1,10]和δ=10^{-4}下有效。通过允许HMM的转移模型依赖于序列位置，显著提升了性能，使合成数据集能够紧密复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了基因组数据的隐私共享，同时为研究人员提供了卓越的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用贝塞尔曲线替代完整SGD轨迹的数据集压缩方法，通过平滑的参数化路径提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号，解决了现有方法中梯度不稳定、收敛慢和存储开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法使用完整SGD轨迹作为对齐目标，但这些轨迹通常噪声大、曲率高且存储密集，导致梯度不稳定、收敛缓慢和内存开销大。

Method: 用平滑的低损失参数化替代物（具体为连接初始和最终模型状态的二次贝塞尔曲线）替代完整SGD轨迹，这些模式连接路径提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于最先进的压缩方法，生成的压缩数据集能够支持临床有效的模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代物，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

TL;DR: Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF) 通过引入熵退火和前瞻调制技术，解决了传统粒子滤波在推理时间缩放中因过程奖励模型过度自信导致的粒子贫化问题，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波在复杂数学推理任务中容易受到过程奖励模型过度自信评分的影响，导致过早利用局部有前景的轨迹，剪枝潜在正确的假设，最终收敛到次优解，特别是在计算预算受限时这种粒子贫化问题尤为严重。

Method: 提出熵粒子滤波(ePF)算法，包含两个新技术：1) 熵退火(EA)：通过熵监控搜索多样性，当多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布以保持探索；2) 前瞻调制(LaM)：基于后继状态评估状态的潜力。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 这些方法通过平衡不同解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR: 提出MDTI框架，通过多模态轨迹表示学习整合GPS序列、网格轨迹和道路网络约束，提升旅行时间估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示，忽略了真实轨迹的可变性，导致信息丢失或特征冗余。需要解决异构数据源和复杂交通动态的挑战。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕获空间、时间和拓扑语义；动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度；采用对比对齐和掩码语言建模两种自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性，解决了传统方法中的信息损失问题。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: ESS-Flow是一种适用于梯度不可靠或不可用情况的有效条件生成方法，特别适用于基于模拟的观测或生成过程中的量化情况。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Result: 简单的显式分布预测目标始终优于复杂的隐式基线方法，预测类别模式崩溃主要由分布不平衡驱动。

Conclusion: 为选择建模策略提供了原则性框架，并为构建更准确和鲁棒的预测系统提供实用指导。

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Motivation: 传统网格模拟精确但计算昂贵，数据驱动的图网络模拟器(GNSs)虽快但需要为每个参数变化重新训练，且数据收集费时。不同参数的模拟共享潜在结构，但现有方法未充分利用。

Method: 使用条件神经过程(CNPs)编码图轨迹生成潜在表示，结合新型神经算子架构减轻时间误差累积。

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习共享结构，有效解决了GNSs对新物理参数需要重新训练的问题，实现了高效准确的物理模拟。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其可扩展性，而线性注意力虽然能降低复杂度，但从头预训练成本过高。现有后训练线性化方法存在线性组件被绕过的问题，需要解决组件使用不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1) 推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2) HedgeCATs，结合注意力权重转移与目标LoRA微调；(3) 计划滑动窗口dropout(SSD)，在训练中随机抑制softmax分支以防止组件崩溃。

Result: 方法在保持计算效率的同时，恢复了大部分基础模型性能，并确保真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了混合转换中性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过提出的三种解决方案，成功解决了混合线性注意力方法中组件使用不平衡的问题，实现了计算效率与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Motivation: 深度生成模型面临样本质量与记忆化之间的基本权衡：高质量样本可能以记忆训练数据而非泛化数据几何结构为代价。

Method: CDC-FM是流匹配的泛化，用空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声替代均匀各向同性噪声，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在合成流形、点云、单细胞基因组学、动物运动捕捉和图像等多样化数据集上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和高度非均匀采样场景下显著优于标准FM。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供了一种可轻松集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒且可扩展的算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

Motivation: 揭示JEPAs中防坍塌项的深层作用，证明它实际上在估计数据密度，而不仅仅是防止表示坍塌。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPAs的防坍塌项与数据密度估计的等价关系，并提出JEPA-SCORE方法，利用模型的Jacobian矩阵高效计算样本概率。

Result: 在合成数据、控制数据集和Imagenet上验证了理论发现，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2等JEPA家族方法以及多模态模型如MetaCLIP。

Conclusion: JEPAs的防坍塌项具有双重功能：防止表示坍塌和估计数据密度，这为数据筛选、异常检测等应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在探索多样性和可靠性之间存在冲突：一方面需要增加不确定性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面又需要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法将置信度与答案质量混为一谈，导致解码策略不够理想。

Method: 提出基于正确性校准的解码规则：在预期正确性高的token上采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样。具体包括Greedy-Threshold（在低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样）、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon（基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值）。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中取得了性能提升，挑战了现有关于不确定性下解码的启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码策略应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，这种方法能够更好地平衡探索多样性和推理质量，在复杂推理任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD检测方法，在小样本训练场景下，贝叶斯方法优于确定性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性和安全性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能够显式表示模型不确定性，在小样本训练场景下特别有价值。

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，当训练样本少于5000时，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测任务中具有优势，能够有效利用先验模型信息来提高检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值机制下Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在低训练误差但可能过拟合的情况下的理论保证。

Method: 使用数据依赖的界限分析Gibbs算法的测试误差，并通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行稳定近似。在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 界限在真实标记数据上产生非平凡预测，并能正确上界随机标签的测试误差。实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 在低温度插值机制下的泛化能力已经通过经典高温度机制下的小训练误差得到预示，这为理解过参数化模型的泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

TL;DR: molFTP是一种紧凑的分子片段-靶点流行度表示方法，通过虚拟掩码和关键留一法防止特征泄漏，实现高效且无偏的交叉验证性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决分子表示学习中特征泄漏问题，开发一种能够防止交叉验证中信息泄露的紧凑表示方法。

Method: 使用分子片段-靶点流行度向量化，结合虚拟掩码程序移除保留分子中的片段信息，并采用关键留一法近似真实分子级留一法。

Result: 关键留一法与真实分子级留一法的偏差低于8%，能够在几乎使用全部数据训练的同时保持无偏的交叉验证性能估计。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、防泄漏的片段-靶点流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或关键留一法以较低成本近似留一法验证。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Result: 仿真和真实世界实验表明，该方法能在实际训练时间内实现自动驾驶策略学习，实现安全、鲁棒且样本高效的学习。

Conclusion: H-DSAC框架为自动驾驶提供了安全、高效的人类引导强化学习方法，成功解决了现实世界应用中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: BLISS是一种无需外部预训练模型的轻量级数据选择方法，通过双层优化估计训练样本的长期影响，显著提升LLM预训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以区分数据选择效果与外部模型影响，且忽略数据在模型收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小规模代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型来估计训练样本的长期影响力，优化样本重要性权重。

Result: 在410M/1B/2.8B模型上验证，1B模型达到同等性能的速度比现有最佳方法快1.7倍，在多个下游任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种高效、无需外部模型的数据选择方案，显著加速LLM预训练过程。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时序点过程的Edit Flow过程，通过插入、删除和替换编辑操作将噪声转换为数据，在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑速率，从而在生成过程中减少必要的编辑操作数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时序点过程模型大多依赖自回归参数化，受到顺序采样的限制。最近的非自回归扩散模型通过离散马尔可夫链中的事件插入和删除来缓解这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入Edit Flow过程，在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习插入、删除和替换编辑操作的瞬时速率，实现从噪声到数据的转换。

Result: 实证结果表明，无条件训练模型在基准时序点过程的各种无条件和条件生成任务中表现出生成灵活性。

Conclusion: Edit Flow过程提供了一个灵活高效的时序点过程模型，有效减少了生成过程中所需的编辑操作数量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

TL;DR: 本文提出MASED指标量化图神经网络中的过平滑效应，通过理论分析发现过平滑程度随权重矩阵和邻接矩阵数量增加而加剧，并提出了G-Reg正则化方案来缓解过平滑问题。


<details>

Motivation: 研究深度图神经网络中导致过平滑效应的因素，特别是量化过平滑程度并分析其与模型参数的关系。

Method: 提出MASED指标量化过平滑，推导层间边界条件，分析权重矩阵奇异值和节点嵌入范数的影响，并设计G-Reg正则化方案。

Result: 实验表明G-Reg能提高节点分类准确率，在深度网络中实现鲁棒性，在冷启动场景下优于浅层网络，并揭示了感受野大小与性能的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 通过控制过平滑效应，深度图神经网络可以在某些任务中超越浅层网络，通过合理分配邻接跳数来避免模型欠拟合或过拟合。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含18,000多个散点图的合成数据集和基准测试，用于评估AI模型在散点图分析任务上的性能。OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在聚类计数任务上表现良好，但在定位相关任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在数据分析和可视化中应用日益广泛，但缺乏针对散点图特定任务的基准测试，限制了对其性能的深入了解。

Method: 创建了来自6个数据生成器和17种图表设计的18,000多个合成散点图数据集，使用N-shot提示法评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在5个不同任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在聚类计数任务上准确率超过90%，但在定位任务上精确率和召回率接近或低于50%。Gemini 2.5 Flash在异常值识别任务上达到65.01%的准确率。图表设计对性能影响较小，但应避免宽高比大的散点图。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在散点图分析中适合计数任务，但在定位任务上仍需改进。建议避免使用宽高比大的散点图设计。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

TL;DR: 提出Tensor-EM方法结合张量矩方法和EM算法，在线性动力系统混合模型中提供可识别性保证并提高参数估计的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性动力系统混合模型在复杂噪声环境中应用困难，张量矩方法有可识别性保证但噪声下性能下降，EM方法灵活但对初始化敏感易陷入局部最优。

Method: 使用输入输出数据构建矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后通过卡尔曼EM算法进行细化，对所有LDS参数进行闭式更新。

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量或随机初始化EM方法更可靠；在灵长类体感皮层神经记录中成功建模不同条件为独立子系统；在序列到达任务神经数据中有效应用。

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法，结合了两种方法的优势。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于失败感知的逆向强化学习算法，专注于被错误分类或难以处理的样本，以更准确地恢复RLHF过程中学习到的潜在奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号难以解释，存在安全风险。现有IRL方法对所有偏好对一视同仁，忽略了最有信息量的失败样本。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分接近的样本，通过这些失败样本来学习更准确的奖励函数。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督。提取的奖励能更好地反映RLHF的真实目标，实现更有效的重新RLHF训练。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种鲁棒、可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐并减少IRL过程中的模糊性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标极其不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么未能解决任务的根本模糊性（不可识别性）。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习框架，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少不可识别性、提供不确定性感知的诊断工具、验证策略级效用。

Result: 该框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。经验验证表明，精炼的低不确定性奖励可直接用于RLHF，实现与真实对齐过程相当的训练动态和毒性降低效果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM的真正目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

*Markus Krimmel,Philip Hartout,Karsten Borgwardt,Dexiong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD)框架，通过二元分类器来评估图生成模型，解决了传统MMD指标在绝对性能衡量和跨描述符可比性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图描述符的MMD指标只能对生成模型进行排序，无法提供绝对性能衡量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的结果不可比。

Method: 通过拟合二元分类器来区分真实图和生成图，使用图描述符进行特征化，分类器的数据对数似然近似JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标约束在[0,1]区间内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较，并推导出理论上有依据的汇总指标来提供更紧密的下界。

Conclusion: PGD相比MMD指标提供了更鲁棒和深入的评估，PolyGraph框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

*Moumita Kamal,Douglas A. Talbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估压缩模型忠实性的新方法，超越传统准确率指标，通过模型一致性和卡方检验来检测压缩后模型行为的细微变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型压缩评估只关注大小与准确率的权衡，忽视了模型忠实性，这在医疗、金融等高风险领域至关重要。压缩模型必须保持与原模型行为的一致性。

Method: 引入忠实性评估指标：使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化。

Result: 对三个多样化社会意义数据集上的ANN应用量化和剪枝，发现高准确率不能保证忠实性，统计测试检测到标准指标（如准确率和均等几率）遗漏的细微但显著变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标提供了一种实用方法，确保压缩带来的效率提升不会损害可信AI所需的公平性或忠实性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

*Haoxin Wang,Xiaolong Tu,Hongyu Ke,Huirong Chai,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了lm-Meter，首个专为设备端LLM推理设计的轻量级在线延迟分析器，能够实时捕获细粒度延迟，帮助识别性能瓶颈和优化机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM部署存在数据隐私和可持续性问题，设备端LLM可提供更好的隐私保护和可靠性，但面临内存和计算资源限制，需要深入了解性能效率权衡。

Method: 开发lm-Meter分析器，在商用移动平台上实现，捕获嵌入、预填充、解码等阶段的细粒度实时延迟，系统开销极小。

Result: lm-Meter在Powersave模式下仅造成2.58%的预填充吞吐量下降和0.99%的解码下降，准确识别了设备端LLM推理的瓶颈和优化机会。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上的LLM运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为设备端LLM系统的优化和普及奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了LEXPOL（词汇策略网络），一种基于语言条件化的混合策略架构，用于多任务强化学习。它使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，并通过学习门控模块选择或混合多个子策略，实现在不同任务间的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来指导不同目标的行为。研究旨在探索如何有效利用语言元数据来索引和重组可重用技能。

Method: LEXPOL架构包含文本编码器编码任务描述，学习门控模块选择或混合多个子策略。支持端到端跨任务训练，并能组合固定专家策略处理新任务描述和未见任务组合。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上匹配或超过强大多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。学习到的语言门控能有效组合专家策略处理新任务。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地在单一策略内索引和重组可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

### [274] [Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06141)
*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降（DSGD）算法在高概率（HP）意义下的收敛性，消除了对梯度有界性和其他限制性假设的要求，在非凸和强凸成本函数下都实现了阶数最优的收敛速率，并展示了用户数量的线性加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件（如梯度有界或噪声渐近消失），导致HP收敛与均方误差（MSE）收敛之间存在显著差距，这与集中式设置中SGD在相同条件下同时保证HP和MSE收敛的情况形成对比。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量（梯度范数平方或最优性间隙）的矩生成函数（MGF）以及用户模型间共识间隙的MGF，提供了去中心化方法在HP意义下的方差缩减效应的新结果，并对强凸成本函数的MGF给出了更精细的边界。

Result: 证明了DSGD在HP意义下收敛，且收敛条件与MSE意义下相同，移除了梯度有界等限制性假设，在非凸和强凸成本函数下都实现了阶数最优的收敛速率，并展示了用户数量的线性加速效果。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了去中心化设置中HP收敛与MSE收敛之间的差距，证明了DSGD在HP意义下保持强性能，并与现有MSE保证相匹配，为去中心化优化提供了更全面的理论保证。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为策略不可知的人类代理生成合成数据，以模拟人类决策，解决异构智能体团队中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友协作的训练挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人类在环数据，限制了可扩展性。需要一种可扩展的方法来模拟人类决策，以训练智能体与策略不可访问或非平稳的队友协作。

Method: 在受Stag Hunt启发的网格世界捕获游戏中进行了三个实验：1) 比较人类参与者、专家和LLMs的决策；2) 修改提示以诱导风险敏感策略；3) 在动态网格世界中测试LLMs生成移动动作。

Result: LLMs在决策一致性上更接近专家，能通过提示诱导模拟人类的风险敏感行为，生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

TL;DR: 提出TabPFN-Wide模型，通过基于定制先验的合成数据继续预训练，扩展现有模型处理高维特征数据的能力，在保持可解释性的同时实现超过50,000个特征的无缝扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域中分子测量与病理学关系分析面临的挑战：数据观测少但特征多（数千个潜在噪声特征），现有基础模型无法处理大特征数量（>500），而特征降维又会阻碍特征重要性分析。

Method: 通过基于定制先验的合成数据继续预训练现有模型，扩展其处理高维数据的能力，开发出TabPFN-Wide模型。

Result: TabPFN-Wide在性能上匹配或超越基础模型，对噪声具有更好的鲁棒性，能够无缝扩展到50,000+特征，同时保持固有的可解释性。在真实生物医学数据集中，模型识别的最相关特征与先前生物学发现高度重叠。

Conclusion: 基于先验信息的适应方法能够有效增强基础模型处理高维数据的能力，为生物医学应用提供了重要的分析工具，既验证了已知发现，又为未来研究提出了潜在起点。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当预测模型涉及特征交互（如乘法关系或联合特征贡献）时，传统特征归因方法的解释变得困难，需要开发能够处理高阶交互的归因理论。

Method: 在积分梯度(IG)的基础上构建高阶特征归因的一般理论，将其与统计学和拓扑信号处理建立自然联系。

Result: 提供了多个理论结果来建立该理论框架，并通过几个示例验证了理论的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的高阶特征归因理论扩展了现有可解释AI框架，能够更好地处理特征交互情况下的归因分析。

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Motivation: 随着维度增加，探索空间呈指数增长，而有意义的技能流形仍然有限，因此语义意义对于在高维空间中有效引导探索变得至关重要。

Method: RGSD首先进行对比预训练将运动嵌入到单位超球面上，将每个参考轨迹聚类为不同的方向，使技能发现同时涉及参考行为的模仿和语义相关多样化行为的发现。

Conclusion: 轻量级的参考引导接地为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Motivation: 虽然后训练量化被广泛用于大语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的机制仍不清楚。研究旨在准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析，涵盖32B参数和15T训练token，并在受控实验中训练自己的模型至100B token，研究训练动态干预措施。

Result: 关键发现是量化误差由学习率与其他训练超参数的复杂相互作用驱动。一旦学习率衰减，验证损失和量化误差就会发散，且与训练数据规模基本无关。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了增加数据集规模会固有地损害量化效果的假设，证明通过策略性训练超参数干预可以在大规模下改善量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具解决复杂问题，但搜索代理的轨迹结构异质性导致标准策略梯度方法存在跨层偏差，扭曲信用分配并阻碍多步搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构属性将其划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与其真实同类比较。

Result: 在多样单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO提升高达11.3分，获得更高训练奖励、更好训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层是解决LLM搜索代理RL中结构异质性问题的原则性解决方案，SAN消除了跨层偏差，提供了更纯净和尺度稳定的学习信号。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

### [284] [Rule Encoding and Compliance in Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05106)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过信息论分析系统提示中规则编码对注意力机制和合规行为的影响，揭示了锚点冗余与注意力熵之间的基本权衡，并提出动态规则验证架构来提高合规输出的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键代理需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为，以保护代理免受提示注入攻击。

Method: 使用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度界限，并结合动态规则验证架构进行形式化证明。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡。热重载已验证规则集能渐进提高合规输出概率。

Conclusion: 强调需要原则性锚点设计和双重执行机制，在保护LLM代理免受提示注入攻击的同时，在演化领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

### [285] [Structured Cognition for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents: Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了结构化认知循环（SCL）架构，将推理、记忆和控制功能分离，相比现有提示框架在任务成功率、目标保真度和可靠性方面有稳定提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM自主代理框架通常将推理、记忆和控制功能混合在单一提示中，这会降低连贯性和可预测性，需要更清晰的架构分离

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，由轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行，允许中间结果存储、重访和检查

Result: 在360个测试案例中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线（70-77%），目标保真度更高，冗余调用更少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中的无支持断言减少

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性，为扩展研究提供了初步指导

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，用于改进LLM从自然语言生成优化模型代码的准确性和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖求解器反馈进行单次前向生成和有限的后处理，存在未被发现的语义错误，导致生成语法正确但逻辑错误的模型。

Method: 提出语义锚点驱动的修正框架，通过将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配的组件，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑优化。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在基于LLM的优化工作流中至关重要，能够确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

TL;DR: 提出了动态裁决模板（DAT）框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个结构化阶段，解决LLM在处理复杂规则系统时的推理发散问题，显著优于传统CoT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本数据而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理发散和关键规则依赖被忽略。

Method: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT），受专家人类推理过程启发，将推理机制结构化为三个方法阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文）、证据收集（基于预定义模板元素提取相关信息并系统验证规则）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果显示DAT在复杂基于规则的任务中持续优于传统CoT方法，使较小语言模型能够匹配甚至超过显著更大的LLM性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架在管理复杂规则系统方面具有高效性和有效性，能够解决LLM在规则处理中的根本局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

TL;DR: 该论文通过算法信息理论为符号接地问题提供了一个统一的框架，证明意义接地是一个受信息理论限制的过程，将哥德尔自指和统计无免费午餐视角统一起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个明确、统一的理论框架，揭示意义接地过程的基本信息理论约束。

Method: 使用通用图灵机建模符号系统，将接地定义为信息压缩过程。通过四个阶段论证：证明纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；展示静态接地系统的不完备性；证明接地行为的不可推断性；利用Chaitin不完备定理证明学习过程的局限性。

Result: 证明了意义接地是一个系统不断尝试克服自身信息理论限制的开放式过程，任何符号系统都无法完全接地所有可能世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统永无止境地试图克服自身信息理论限制的开放过程，符号接地问题在根本上受到算法信息理论的约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著简化了求解偏微分方程的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题解释为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定的训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补的智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行和诊断错误以进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明Lang-PINN显著优于竞争基线：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少高达74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为构建PINN提供了强大且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

TL;DR: 该调查论文探讨了基础模型的表征潜力，即其学习到的表示能够捕捉单模态任务信息，同时为跨模态对齐和统一提供可转移基础的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型通过大规模预训练学习高度可转移的表征，研究表明这些表征在不同架构和模态间表现出显著相似性，这激发了对其表征潜力的系统性研究。

Method: 通过回顾代表性基础模型和关键对齐度量指标，综合来自视觉、语言、语音、多模态和神经科学研究的实证证据，分析表征空间中的结构规律性和语义一致性。

Result: 证据表明基础模型在其表征空间中经常表现出结构规律性和语义一致性，使其成为跨模态转移和对齐的有力候选者。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有强大的表征潜力，能够支持跨模态对齐和统一，但仍存在开放问题和潜在挑战需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

TL;DR: 提出一个包含六个语义层的实时物联网框架，通过语义注释、互操作性和推理层帮助物联网设备理解数据含义，使用模糊逻辑、贝叶斯网络等技术进行知识推理，适用于动态环境特别是农业应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，现有系统缺乏对数据含义和来源的语义理解能力，需要更智能的框架来处理实时数据并生成新知识。

Method: 六层框架：感知层收集电压数据；语义注释层添加元数据；互操作层使用标准化算法和同义词识别；传输层通过无线技术传输；语义推理层使用模糊逻辑、Dempster-Shafer理论和贝叶斯网络；应用层提供GUI界面。

Result: 构建了一个完整的语义物联网框架，能够实现数据标准化、语义互操作性和实时知识推理，为物联网数据管理提供稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作技术，为物联网应用特别是农业领域提供了有价值的工具，确保了语义完整性并支持实时知识推断。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dramaturge是一个基于分层多LLM代理的任务导向分治方法，用于改进长篇叙事脚本的质量。它通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段，以自上而下的方式确保局部修改与整体叙事要求的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM已广泛用于创意内容生成，但单次生成过程难以产生高质量的长篇叙事。直接修改通常会导致局部编辑与整体叙事要求之间的不一致。

Method: 提出Dramaturge方法，包含三个层次：全局审查阶段把握整体故事情节和结构问题；场景级审查阶段识别详细的场景和句子缺陷；分层协调修订阶段协调并整合整个脚本的结构和细节改进。采用从粗到精的迭代过程。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有即插即用特性，可以轻松集成到现有方法中以改进生成的脚本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在COVID-19等公共卫生紧急情况下，传统分析方法难以处理半结构化数据（结构化人口信息和未结构化人类反馈），专家评估效率低，标准NLP方法需要大量标注数据且泛化能力差。

Method: 开发了弱监督的图推理框架，将大语言模型与人口属性和公众反馈集成，动态建模公民需求为需求感知图，基于年龄、性别、多重剥夺指数等关键特征进行人口特定分析。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验结果证明了该方法的可行性，能够生成可解释的洞察来支持健康政策决策。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境中的智能人口健康监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Motivation: 重复采样能显著提升AI模型的能力和风险，但如何在有限采样预算下准确预测模型在大规模尝试时的行为是一个关键问题，这对模型提供商和政府监管者都很重要。

Method: 1) 发现标准拟合方法存在统计缺陷；2) 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架；3) 提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 该方法能够在有限计算成本下更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力表现。

Conclusion: 结合这些创新方法，可以在计算成本大幅降低的情况下，更准确地预测AI模型在大规模部署时的能力和风险表现。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

Motivation: 现有基于单一信号、模型奖励的方法在多模态大语言模型对齐中存在置信度校准不足、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练等问题。

Method: 提出混合奖励建模框架：结合模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供显式正确性信号）；引入多方面奖励确保指令遵循；采用广义长度惩罚奖励稳定训练。

Result: 在3B参数模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%；特别在数学基准测试中，平均提升约16%，显著提升数学推理和问题解决能力。

Conclusion: 混合和多方面奖励建模框架为多模态大语言模型对齐提供了灵活有效的强化学习策略优化方法，在不同多模态基准测试中均取得一致改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Motivation: 现实世界数据库应用需要多轮交互来处理模糊查询、执行错误和用户需求变化，但现有多轮基准测试存在局限性，无法反映生产级数据库助手的挑战。

Method: 构建了包含分层知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境；设计了两种评估设置：预定义对话协议和开放代理设置；创建了覆盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有很高难度，GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%的任务。通过记忆嫁接和交互测试时缩放验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT基准测试成功恢复了多轮交互式文本到SQL任务的真实性，为评估和开发更强大的数据库助手提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn

limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学研究中证据合成的复杂性，提供透明、可解释的推理过程，强调可追溯性和用户可审计性。

Method: 采用多代理架构，每个代理专门处理特定的证据流，实现并行处理和细粒度分析，结合确定性代码进行验证。

Result: 评估显示在效率和输出一致性方面取得显著提升，系统可作为证据合成的实用工具和多代理LLM系统的测试平台。

Conclusion: M-Reason展示了多代理LLM系统在科学研究中的潜力，提供了透明、可审计的证据合成解决方案。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

TL;DR: 评估贝叶斯方法在模型预测控制(MPC)中的应用，重点关注神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化，发现性能提升证据零散且缺乏标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯方法在MPC中用于捕捉和传播不确定性，但现有研究缺乏系统评估和标准化基准，需要更严谨的方法来确定其有效性。

Method: 系统分析贝叶斯方法在MPC中的个体研究，包括神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化的实际实现方式。

Result: 贝叶斯方法在MPC中应用日益增多，但报告的性能和鲁棒性提升证据零散，基准不一致且可靠性分析有限。

Conclusion: 需要标准化基准、消融研究和透明报告来严格评估贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

TL;DR: MHA-RAG框架通过将示例表示为软提示而非纯文本，在少样本场景下显著提升性能并降低推理成本，且不受示例顺序影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示存在效率低、成本高的问题，需要探索更有效的示例表示方式。

Method: 提出MHA-RAG框架，使用多注意力头控制软提示生成，将示例表示为软提示而非纯文本，采用示例顺序不变的模型架构。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和模型规模下，MHA-RAG相比标准RAG性能提升20分，推理成本降低10倍GFLOPs，且不受示例顺序影响。

Conclusion: 软提示表示比纯文本表示更高效、稳定，MHA-RAG框架在少样本场景下实现了精度和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有意义的AI协作需要理解符号及其社会建构意义，而AI系统往往错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动论理论，进行了两个实证研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义。

Result: 参与者会根据AI建议的符号和解释调整初始意义定义，特别是在引入社会情境时；参与者会投射个人和社会价值观到互动中，随时间精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解来自符号的双向交换和重新解释，而非单纯同意，这为人机交互设计提出了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的钢热处理硬度预测方法，解决多对一映射的逆问题，实现从目标硬度反推输入参数配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢热处理过程中不同输入参数组合可能产生相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数的逆问题特别困难

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练前向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测最终硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈进行迭代优化

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上测试，相比基线回归和强化学习模型，师生框架不仅获得更高的逆预测精度，且计算时间显著减少

Conclusion: 师生学习框架在材料科学逆过程建模中展现出高效性和有效性，为多对一映射问题提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLM仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，发现LLM能够重新发现可行解决方案并偶尔提出创造性方法，但其问题解决能力仍然脆弱且对问题表述敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的成功是源于真正的推理能力还是复杂的记忆能力，测试LLM是否能够仅使用预训练参数知识生成有效的AI研究问题解决方案。

Method: 从ICLR 2025高质量投稿中提取精炼问题陈述，让专门的求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善技术解决方案，使用LLM作为评判者进行结构化评估，并辅以针对性人工检查。

Result: LLM能够重新发现可行解决方案并偶尔提出创造性替代方法，但其问题解决能力仍然脆弱且对问题表述高度敏感。

Conclusion: 这是关于LLM作为自主科学问题解决者能力的首次大规模证据，既突显了其潜在能力，也揭示了当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合答案集编程(ASP)与transformer学习的混合神经符号框架，用于航空安全报告系统(ASRS)的多标签文本分类，通过规则增强和模糊逻辑正则化提升分类性能并减少逻辑违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但在安全关键应用中经常违反专家认为必要的领域逻辑，这是一个特别值得关注的问题。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证。采用两种互补方式：1) 基于规则的数据增强，生成逻辑一致的合成样本；2) 模糊逻辑正则化，在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强基线(BCE)相比，该方法提高了micro-和macro-F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在编程任务中表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中工作的模型更容易过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类协作日益增多，需要了解影响共同代理的认知边界和偏见，特别是AI是否也表现出人类的过度自信模式。

Method: 通过分析模型在不同编程语言中的置信度和性能表现，研究AI模型在编码任务中的自信偏差模式。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中工作的模型表现出更强的邓宁-克鲁格效应，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实表现出类似人类的认知偏见，特别是在不熟悉或资源匮乏的领域中，这种过度自信模式与人类相似。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型在争议性公共议题中是否保持稳定价值立场的基准测试，通过对比模型在正反两方面提示下的回答一致性来衡量价值对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规检测，但无法揭示模型在面对真实世界争议问题时是否坚持一致的价值体系，因此需要开发能评估价值一致性的新基准。

Method: 从维基百科争议章节构建11.5万对正反提示对，使用LLM作为评判员来评分模型在配对回答中的一致性与分歧程度。

Result: 在主流开源和闭源模型上的测试显示，模型间的价值对齐程度差异很大，并揭示了安全策略（如拒绝回答）与更丰富价值体系之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统性地比较LLMs在体现人类价值观方面的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过生成漏洞相关的推理数据来解决现有方法缺乏高质量训练数据和难以验证中间修复过程的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件漏洞的指数级增长，对自动漏洞修复(AVR)解决方案的需求日益迫切。现有基于大语言模型的方法面临两个主要挑战：缺乏高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证中间修复过程。

Method: 论文将AVR建模为序列生成问题，利用大语言模型生成漏洞修复。与现有方法不同，该方法专注于生成漏洞相关的推理数据，以更好地捕捉漏洞修复模式。

Result: 现有方法虽然表现出最先进的性能，但由于缺乏漏洞相关推理数据和难以验证中间修复过程，往往无法有效捕捉多样化的漏洞修复模式。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的方法来生成高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，并解决漏洞修复过程中间验证的挑战，以提升自动漏洞修复的效果。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究开发了稳健的排放预测模型，能够为政策制定者提供数据驱动的决策支持。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多样化目标任务，使用轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应，显著提升了VLA模型在未见任务上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型在具身推理中表现有潜力，但距离真正的通用模型还有差距——它们通常需要任务特定的微调，并且在未见任务上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出MetaVLA框架，引入上下文感知元协同训练，将多样化目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，同时利用结构多样化的辅助任务改进域内泛化。采用基于注意力神经过程的轻量级元学习机制，实现从多样化上下文的快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA在六个辅助任务上比OpenVLA在长时程任务上性能提升高达8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: 结果表明可扩展、低资源的后训练是可行的，为通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，泛化能力弱；智能体系统虽然通过模块化分解工作，但大多缺乏训练或离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的动态特性。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演进记忆系统，使用Flow-GRPO算法在多轮环境中进行在线策略训练，通过轨迹级结果广播解决长视野稀疏奖励的信用分配问题。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均提升14.9%，智能体任务14.0%，数学任务14.5%，科学任务4.1%，甚至超越GPT-4o等大型专有模型。

Conclusion: 在线优化带来显著优势，包括改进的规划能力、增强的工具调用可靠性，以及随着模型规模和推理轮次增加的正向扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Motivation: 传统静态AI模型无法适应动态无线环境，需要能够自主演进、持续改进的AI系统来应对未来无线系统的复杂性。

Method: 采用多代理协作的自演进代理AI框架，包含角色专业化提示的多个LLM，在监督代理协调下通过结构化对话、迭代反馈和系统验证实现自主生命周期管理。

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation

TL;DR: GPT-4o能高精度地从放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性），这些标签可用于训练具有竞争力的多标签X射线图像分类模型，且标签不确定性不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X射线的多标签图像分类。

Method: 使用GPT-4o从锁骨、肘部和拇指的X射线报告中提取结构化标签（真/假/不确定），然后将这些标签用于ResNet50的多标签分类训练，比较包含和排除不确定标签的策略。

Result: GPT-4o在测试集中标签提取准确率达98.6%。基于标签训练的模型在内部和外部数据集上都表现出色（肘部AUC=0.80），不同标签策略间无显著差异（p≥0.15）。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能准确提取放射学报告标签来训练有竞争力的多标签分类模型，检测到的不确定性不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

TL;DR: D2E框架通过桌面游戏数据预训练，成功将数字交互中的感知运动原语迁移到物理机器人任务，在LIBERO操作任务上达到96.6%成功率，CANVAS导航任务上达到83.3%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理轨迹数据收集成本高昂，而桌面游戏环境提供了大规模丰富的感知运动交互，同时保持了结构化观察-动作耦合，可作为机器人具身AI的有效预训练基础。

Method: D2E框架包含三个组件：OWA工具包统一桌面交互格式并实现152倍压缩；Generalist-IDM通过基于时间戳的事件预测实现零样本泛化；VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理操作和导航任务。

Result: 使用1.3K+小时数据（259小时人类演示和1K+小时伪标签游戏数据），在LIBERO操作任务上达到96.6%成功率，CANVAS导航任务上达到83.3%成功率。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的感知运动原语具有足够的恒定性，能够有意义地迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AIC-VDS方法，使用基于注意力的上下文学习来优化多无人机在灾害监测中的数据收集调度和速度控制，以减少数据丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决灾害监测中无人机数据收集的挑战，传统深度强化学习方法训练复杂且存在仿真与现实不匹配的问题，无法满足海啸监测的紧急需求。

Method: 使用基于注意力的上下文学习(AIC-VDS)，通过自然语言提示和示例指导进行任务适应，无需重新训练，同时考虑地面传感器电池水平、队列长度、信道条件和无人机轨迹。

Result: 仿真结果表明，AIC-VDS在性能上优于Deep-Q-Network(DQN)和最大信道增益基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的AIC-VDS为紧急情况下的无人机数据收集提供了有效的替代方案，具有强大的推理和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

TL;DR: Syn-Diag是一个云边协同的少样本故障诊断框架，利用大语言模型解决数据稀缺和资源受限环境部署问题，通过视觉语义协同、内容感知推理和云边协同机制，在1-shot和跨工况场景中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业故障诊断面临数据稀缺和大型AI模型在资源受限环境中部署困难的双重挑战，需要开发能够在少样本条件下高效运行的轻量级诊断系统。

Method: 采用三层机制：1）视觉语义协同，通过跨模态预训练将信号特征与大语言模型语义空间对齐；2）内容感知推理，动态构建上下文提示增强少样本诊断准确性；3）云边协同，通过知识蒸馏创建轻量级边缘模型，支持在线更新。

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic
agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the
current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics.

### [316] [ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05746)
*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARM（Agentic Reasoning Module）新范式，通过树搜索和代码突变自动优化CoT推理，显著优于手动设计和现有自动MAS设计方法，并具有出色的跨模型和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注，而简单的CoT推理表现却很有竞争力，因此需要深入研究MAS的基本推理单元。

Method: 引入ARM作为CoT的智能体化泛化，每个推理步骤由专门模块执行。通过代码空间的树搜索，从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹反思指导突变来发现模块。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的MAS和最先进的自动MAS设计方法，构建的MAS在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能而无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM提供了一个通用的推理构建块，可作为直接递归循环或元编排器的子程序使用，在跨模型和跨任务泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用图神经网络模拟拉格朗日粒子扩散模型，实现大气传输足迹和温室气体浓度测量的快速不确定性量化，相比传统模型加速约1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温室气体排放监测需要高效可扩展的推断方法，但传统传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以表征，人工智能提供了加速模拟和量化不确定性的双重机会。

Method: 基于图神经网络的集合管道，模拟拉格朗日粒子扩散模型，计算大气传输足迹、温室气体摩尔分数及其不确定性。

Result: 模拟器比NAME LPDM加速约1000倍，成功重现大规模足迹结构，集合分析揭示了预测误差的空间相关性，集合分布突出了低置信度的时空预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的鲁棒性，为温室气体通量估计提供更全面的不确定性预算路径。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于多模态特征的早期网络迷因病毒性预测方法，使用混合参与度评分定义病毒性，在30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性，特别是文化复杂、快速演变的迷因，仍然具有挑战性。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度评分的病毒性定义方法。评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知机等模型，采用包含静态内容和网络特征的综合多模态特征集，在30-420分钟的时间窗口内进行预测。

Result: XGBoost表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的早期病毒性预测基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

TL;DR: RareAgent是一个自演进多智能体系统，通过对抗性辩论动态构建证据图来改进罕见病药物重定位，在缺乏先验药物-疾病关联的情况下表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位面临挑战，当药物与目标疾病之间没有先验关联时，知识图谱补全和消息传递GNN缺乏可靠信号来学习和传播，导致性能不佳。

Method: 采用自演进多智能体系统，通过任务特定的对抗性辩论，让智能体从不同角度动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，并在事后分析推理策略以改进智能体策略。

Result: RareAgent将指示AUPRC提高了18.1%，优于推理基线方法，并提供了与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: 该系统成功地将罕见病药物重定位任务从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，并通过自演进机制产生可转移的启发式方法来加速未来研究。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM成功展示了专门针对CP建模的LLM的有效性，为构建神经符号AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是高效创建推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的应用

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

Result: 在三个模型规模和多个数据集上的实验表明，说服优化策略相比真理优化能减少高达13.94%的训练-测试泛化差距，同时保持或超过真理优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力比协作寻求真理更能培养可迁移的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体时间序列分类框架，通过基于示例的上下文推理实现高效分类，无需预训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，特定任务的训练成本高且不灵活。现有大语言模型在理解时间模式方面有潜力，但纯零样本使用效果不佳。

Method: 将多变量序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，使用推理LLM比较查询与示例，生成带置信度的通道级标签，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在九个UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转变为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过动态生成数学测试实例来评估模型推理能力，避免测试集污染和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学能力评估面临两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，现有数学基准因符号和规则多样性有限且答案封闭而容易过拟合。

Method: 利用上述缺点构建动态反事实基准MatheMagic，在测试时随机生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎而非归纳问题，且会回归到标准数学；数学适应模型未能展现通用推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效揭示过拟合并测量真实推理能力，提供稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Motivation: 赋权作为衡量智能体对环境潜在影响的信息论度量，在无监督强化学习和技能学习中已有应用，但作为预训练信号的研究有限。本文旨在探索赋权作为通用预训练策略的潜力。

Method: 扩展传统赋权概念，引入折扣赋权来平衡短期和长期控制；提出新的预训练范式，通过最大化折扣赋权来初始化策略，使智能体获得对环境动态的稳健理解。

Result: 基于赋权的预训练策略在各种强化学习算法中表现出数据效率和有效性，能够显著提高下游任务的适应性。

Conclusion: 赋权最大化策略具有长期视野时是数据高效且有效的，为将该框架扩展到高维复杂任务铺平了道路，推动了强化学习领域的发展。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

TL;DR: SAT-Graph API是一个用于法律领域结构化知识图谱的查询执行层，通过原子化、可组合、可审计的原语操作，将概率性发现与确定性检索分离，实现透明可审计的检索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准RAG在法律领域的核心限制，特别是如何在保持确定性属性的同时可靠地查询结构化知识，满足高风险领域对可解释AI的需求。

Method: 引入SAT-Graph API作为正式查询执行层，基于规范动作（原子化、可组合、可审计的原语），通过规划器引导的代理将复杂查询分解为这些动作的有向无环图。

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪，将检索从不透明的黑盒转变为透明可审计的过程。

Conclusion: 这种双层架构直接满足了高风险领域对可解释AI的要求，为法律领域的结构化知识查询提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较不同模型的测试时扩展能力，但现有评估方法存在不足。

Method: 设计ARISE评估指标，包含样本级感知（惩罚负扩展行为）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token数不稳定的影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务上的实验表明，ARISE能可靠地测量测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型间扩展效率存在显著差异，Claude Opus表现出最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE为评估推理模型的测试时扩展能力提供了可靠且细粒度的度量标准，有助于模型比较和选择。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在最终输出前拒绝分数急剧下降，表明拒绝意图被系统性抑制。通过因果干预识别出少量注意力头是关键因素，仅消除3%的头就能显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具有强大的多步推理能力，但存在严重的安全漏洞且机制尚不明确。本研究旨在通过机制可解释性方法探究推理模型中安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪不同token位置的拒绝意图，识别"拒绝悬崖"现象；通过因果干预分析确定负面影响拒绝行为的稀疏注意力头；提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法Cliff-as-a-Judge来修复安全对齐。

Result: 发现许多对齐不良的推理模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示，但在最终输出前拒绝意图急剧下降；仅消除3%的负面注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下；提出的数据选择方法仅需1.7%的传统安全训练数据就能达到相当的安全改进效果。

Conclusion: 推理模型的安全对齐失败不是由于模型本质上不安全，而是拒绝意图被系统性抑制；通过机制性干预和高效的数据选择方法可以显著提升模型的安全性，体现了安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning是一个动态调整推理深度的框架，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤都采用相同的详细推理方式，但子问题的难度和复杂性差异很大，导致大量冗余。只有少数关键步骤真正具有挑战性，而许多其他步骤只需简单处理。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，使思维链成为困难步骤详细推理和简单步骤简洁推理的混合体。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了传统推理模型中的冗余问题，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法演化的科学助手，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试的反馈驱动循环，持续改进科学算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法演化（如AlphaEvolve），要么仅进行深度研究，两者都有局限性。纯算法演化依赖LLM内部知识，在复杂领域快速达到瓶颈；纯深度研究提出想法但缺乏验证，导致不切实际的解决方案。

Method: DeepEvolve整合深度研究与算法演化，在反馈驱动的迭代循环中结合外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试。每个迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物学、材料和专利等9个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: 通过弥合无引导演化与无基础研究之间的差距，DeepEvolve为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可观测性数据集在公共基准中代表性不足，通常经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 从5G电信网络收集大规模可观测性数据，构建TelecomTS数据集，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和明确的尺度信息。

Result: 基准测试显示，现有的时间序列、语言和推理模型在处理可观测性数据的突发性、噪声和高方差动态时表现不佳。实验强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐，解决了传统算法灵活性不足和LLM方法空间推理能力弱的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路线推荐算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法虽然灵活但在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在不足。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：首先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后由管理器协调约束代理、POI代理和路径优化代理，最后通过验证代理确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功连接了语言灵活性和空间结构，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理，为自然语言路线推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Result: 经典AI和基于LLM的模型在基于属性的目标对齐上表现相当，经典AI在中等风险配置上表现出稍好的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务上表现相似，经典AI在特定风险配置下略有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了实证比较。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化LLMs在竞争性环境中的表现会导致模型失调，即使有对齐保障，竞争压力仍会驱动欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害行为的增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，揭示市场驱动的优化压力如何系统性地削弱模型对齐，形成恶性竞争。

Method: 在广告营销、选举和社交媒体等竞争性场景中使用模拟环境，测量优化竞争成功率时的模型行为变化。

Result: 销售提升6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；得票率提升4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹言论增加12.5%；参与度提升7.5%伴随虚假信息激增188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 竞争性成功以对齐为代价，当前的对齐保障措施很脆弱，需要更强有力的治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.
