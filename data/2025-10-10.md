### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合等技术，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题，在保持实时性能的同时提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的核心挑战，需要开发能够在实际环境中实时运行且准确检测小目标的系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实数据权重平衡策略，使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别分布。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，在保持实时性能的同时验证了各模块的贡献，并测试了系统在极端光照和海况下的表现。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度和精度平衡，为海上目标检测提供了有效的实时解决方案。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含45k人类标注和新的背景/前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级评估中比现有方法提升2%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：忽视动态相机运动的重要性，以及仅关注模型级评分而忽略视频级评估。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示的基准，收集45k人类标注；提出基于对象错误图的新背景一致性指标，以及基于点跟踪的前景一致性指标。

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，提升超过2个百分点。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RISP方法，结合重启惯性和基于分数的图像先验，在解决病态成像逆问题时实现快速收敛和高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED专注于设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速依赖启发式方法。需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，同时保留基于分数的图像先验。理论分析显示RISP获得比RED更快的驻点收敛速度。

Result: 实验证明RISP在各种成像逆问题中实现快速收敛，同时获得高质量重建结果。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制和基于分数的先验，在病态成像逆问题中平衡了收敛速度和重建质量。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像纯化策略的超低剂量CT去噪框架，解决真实临床数据中的空间错位问题，通过频率域流匹配模型实现优异的解剖结构保持效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著降低辐射剂量但引入严重噪声和伪影，且与正常剂量CT图像对存在显著空间错位，现有去噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 构建真实临床uLDCT肺数据集，提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的图像对，并设计频率域流匹配模型协同工作。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，IP策略显著提升多种主流去噪模型性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为解决真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出D2RA攻击方法，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱生成模型中的语义水印，暴露当前水印设计的根本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，水印技术对于内容溯源和归属认证变得至关重要。虽然最近的语义水印方案通过在潜在或频率表示中嵌入信号提高了鲁棒性，但作者发现这些方法在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然脆弱。

Method: 提出D2RA方法，这是一种无需训练、单图像攻击技术，无需访问底层模型。通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，D2RA能够抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能够持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的根本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法有效暴露了现有语义水印方案的脆弱性，为改进水印设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个基于扩散模型的视频风格转换框架，通过插入低秩适配器和利用静态图像数据训练，实现内容保持和风格转换的视频风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格转换中缺乏配对视频数据监督的问题，需要在保持视频内容的同时实现文本指定的风格转换。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器到自注意力层，利用配对静态图像数据训练，通过共享增强模拟相机运动构建合成训练剪辑，并提出上下文-风格分类器自由引导方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估中均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格转换中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格迁移。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TRAVL微调方法和ImplausiBench基准，用于评估和改进视频生成模型的物理合理性，解决现有视频语言模型在时空和因果推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理定律的序列，但缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。现有视频语言模型在识别物理违规方面表现不佳，暴露了其时序和因果推理的根本局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块，改进视频语言模型中的运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉时序理解。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench提供了一个统一框架，用于探索和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性，揭示了视觉时序理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 该工作为定量评估视频生成模型的物理真实性提供了新方法，通过改进的视频语言模型和专门的基准测试，推动了多模态模型在物理推理能力方面的发展。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出S3FN网络，通过结合文本描述来增强高光谱图像分类性能，解决传统单模态模型过拟合和特征-标签对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类面临训练样本有限、数据维度高导致过拟合的问题，且传统模型仅依赖光谱-空间数据，缺乏语义信息。

Method: 使用LLM生成类别文本描述，通过BERT等文本编码器提取语义特征，与光谱-空间特征融合进行多模态分类。

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上取得显著性能提升，验证了文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同作用。

Conclusion: 文本语义能有效增强高光谱图像分类，为语义增强的HSI分类模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私人敏感信息，现有遗忘方法主要针对纯文本模型，而VLM增加了视觉信息的复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的重要性，通过外部模块在低重要性视觉token中编码遗忘信息，不改变预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，能有效防止信息泄露并保持参考模型行为。

Conclusion: CAGUL为VLM提供了一种实用有效的遗忘解决方案，无需重新训练成本，不改变预训练参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaizeStandCounting (MaSC)算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米幼苗，在两种模式下均与人工计数高度一致，处理速度快，适合实时操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玉米株数准确计数对作物管理和研究至关重要，但人工计数劳动密集、速度慢且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化大的田地中。

Method: MaSC算法有两种模式：马赛克图像分块处理和原始视频帧对齐处理。使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，区分玉米与杂草，基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃实地人工计数相比，马赛克模式R^2=0.616，原始帧模式R^2=0.906。处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒，包括推理和后处理。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米株数计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet在检测重叠数字和对抗仿射变换方面优于传统CNN，但训练和测试速度慢，限制了实时应用

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，并使用更强大的解码器来增强性能

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上推理速度提升5倍，准确率只有轻微下降

Conclusion: Quick-CapsNet是开发快速实时CapsNet应用的可行起点

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种针对整流流模型的改进引导方法，通过自适应预测器-校正器机制解决标准CFG在整流流模型中引起的离流形漂移问题，在保持确定性的同时确保轨迹稳定在数据流形附近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CFG方法在整流流模型上应用时会产生严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要一种几何感知的引导方法来保持稳定性。

Method: 提出自适应预测器-校正器引导：首先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间进行插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上的实验表明，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上始终优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知条件规则相结合，确保速度场的边际一致性，轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在各种引导强度下都能保持稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

### [13] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PIT-QMM模型，利用多模态数据（文本、图像、点云）进行无参考点云质量评估，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并支持失真定位和识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。需要自动评估点云感知质量而无需参考模型。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云数据，利用不同模态的互补信息来预测质量分数。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，且训练迭代次数更少。框架还支持失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径，在点云质量评估领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有动作分割方法主要关注单流时空建模，但双流方法能学习动作特征来提升分割性能。研究探索引入第二流动作特征来捕获动作和动作转换线索。

Method: 使用双流架构（帧级流和动作级流），通过时间上下文块融合互补信息，采用交叉注意力和基于量子的动作引导调制。提出双流对齐损失，包含关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持领先性能的同时，实现了优越的参数效率和计算效率。

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧一次替换策略，有效解决了传统双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中的适应问题，实现了高效且性能优异的视频虚拟试穿。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用IP-Adapter自动生成掩码的方法，在第二次推理过程中对图像token进行掩码处理，使文本提示能够更好地控制背景，从而提高个性化扩散模型的文本提示对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单地重现主体图像，无法有效响应文本提示对背景和环境的描述。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter在推理过程中自动生成的掩码，在第二次推理过程中对图像token进行掩码处理，将主体区域与背景分离，使文本提示能够专注于控制背景内容。

Result: 与几种测试时个性化方法相比，该方法在文本提示和源图像对齐度方面表现优异，能够准确描绘主体同时完美匹配文本提示描述的位置和场景。

Conclusion: 通过利用自动生成的掩码分离主体和背景，该方法有效解决了个性化扩散模型中文本提示被忽略的问题，实现了更好的文本-图像对齐效果。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中的解剖结构错位累积问题，并使用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中表现优异，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法根据图像的不同变形需求自适应确定迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 1. FERM模块：包含三个顺序块，分别提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征和估计最终变形场；2. TCI策略：双阶段迭代控制，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性；3. 将FERM和TCI集成到金字塔网络中形成TCIP模型。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: TCIP模型有效解决了金字塔网络中的解剖错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，FERM和TCI模块具有良好的通用性，可以集成到现有配准网络中提升性能。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Result: 实验表明该方法在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于先前工作。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为指定元素提供高可控性，同时为未指定元素保持多样性，解决了视频生成中混合控制粒度的问题。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted

to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model

that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Motivation: 基于中心的方法在建模全局结构方面表现优异，但往往忽视了重要的局部相似性信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 采用双分支结构：强分支基于中心方法，弱分支基于配对方法。通过相互学习机制和混合哈希专家模块实现知识迁移和跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH持续优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架有效结合了基于中心方法的全局建模能力和基于配对方法的局部相似性学习优势，实现了更优的哈希学习性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter框架在电商图像修复任务中表现出色，同时贡献了EcomPaint-100K数据集和EcomPaint-Bench基准

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman展示了一个有前景的3D生成模型方向，通过整合2D多视图生成和3D原生生成的互补优势，实现了高质量的人体重建。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Conclusion: ComGS框架通过SOPs和简化的光照估计方法，有效解决了高斯泼溅中物体-场景组合的挑战，实现了高效、高质量的实时渲染和快速编辑。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大、难以同时保留高光和阴影细节的问题，避免RGB包围曝光方法的重影和对齐问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复。构建9档包围曝光数据集，仅使用最短曝光作为输入。

Result: 实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有单帧方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节并避免重影问题。

Conclusion: 仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，该方法在动态场景中具有鲁棒性，为超高动态范围成像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过结合RGB和事件模态，利用事件运动先验指导变形场优化，成功解决了大帧间运动下动态3D高斯溅射重建的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GTR-Bench基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理方面的能力，特别关注移动目标在大规模摄像头网络中的追踪和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空基准主要关注自我中心视角的图像/视频推理或地理视角的图形推理，缺乏同时使用图像/视频和图形上下文来评估地理时空智能的基准，这对于交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在摄像头网络中进行多视角切换、跨多个非重叠视野视频的联合推理，以及对未观测时空区域的推断。

Result: 评估10多个流行VLM显示，即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro（34.9%）也显著落后于人类表现（78.61%），并发现当前模型在地理时空推理中的三个主要缺陷。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新机会，揭示了当前模型在地理时空推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法通常只计算起始帧到顶点帧的光流，忽略了顶点到结束阶段的运动信息，导致丢失重要的运动动态特征。

Method: 提出MM-COF运动表示方法，整合两个微表情阶段的运动信息；设计FMANet端到端网络，内部化双相位分析和幅度调制为可学习模块，自适应融合运动线索并关注显著面部区域。

Conclusion: 可学习的双相位框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力，能够更全面地捕捉微表情的完整运动动态。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Conclusion: 提出的基于房间几何约束的深度估计框架能够有效利用几何信息，显著提升360度室内全景图的深度估计质量。

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

TL;DR: 提出ACAVP（仿射、颜色和加法视觉提示）方法，通过引入仿射变换和颜色变换增强视觉提示的表达能力，同时使用TrivialAugment数据增强解决过拟合问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达能力受限和参数增加时容易过拟合的问题，限制了其在视觉任务中的应用效果。

Method: ACAVP结合三种变换：仿射变换创建任务特定提示区域并保留原始图像信息，颜色变换强调任务相关视觉特征，加法变换作为补充。使用TrivialAugment数据增强缓解过拟合。

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最优准确率，平均准确率超过线性探测方法，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，同时保持推理时的最小计算开销。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换表达能力和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示方法的性能，证明了适当的数据增强对所有视觉提示方法都有普遍益处。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中常有多人与多物体的复杂交互，但现有3D人-物交互基准只考虑部分简单交互，需要更全面的数据集和模型。

Method: 基于MMHOI数据集，开发了端到端的transformer网络MMHOI-Net，采用结构化双补丁表示建模物体及其交互，结合动作识别增强交互预测。

Result: 在MMHOI和CORE4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多HOI建模方面达到最先进性能，在准确性和重建质量方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net模型为下一代HOI研究提供了全面测试平台，有效解决了多人与多物体复杂交互的3D建模问题。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在大型城市场景中会出现严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在高分辨率渲染下。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: 提出PrismGS框架，包含两个协同正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督（通过预滤波图像金字塔强制渲染一致性）和显式尺寸正则化（对3D高斯尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束）。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，在4K渲染下保持卓越质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，能够显著改善3D高斯的渲染行为，有效缓解闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘问题，在大规模城市场景中实现高质量渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架能够有效实现手语到语音的直接翻译，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

TL;DR: AlignGS是一个新颖的框架，通过协同优化几何和语义来实现稀疏视图的3D重建，利用2D基础模型的丰富先验知识直接正则化3D表示，在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着增强现实、虚拟现实和机器人应用对语义丰富的室内3D模型需求增长，从稀疏视图创建这些模型仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常将语义视为被动特征，而作者认为语义理解应该成为主动引导力量以实现鲁棒的稀疏视图重建。

Method: 提出了AlignGS框架，通过端到端协同优化几何和语义，从2D基础模型中提取丰富先验，并使用一组新颖的语义到几何引导机制（包括深度一致性和多面法向正则化）直接正则化3D表示。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛评估表明，该方法在新视角合成方面达到了最先进的结果，并产生了具有优越几何精度的重建结果。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型，验证了语义引导在稀疏视图重建中的有效性。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test

self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的feedforward重建方法在驾驶场景重建中泛化能力和精度有限，主要由于固定视角变换在相机配置变化时失效，以及稀疏视图重叠区域小、场景复杂导致学习困难。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题，在多种场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有训练无关的token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Conclusion: MARC展示了在资源受限环境中实现高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的框架，通过在推理时优化新参数并与时空布局对齐，提升视频基础模型在组合场景中的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在视觉生成方面表现出色，但在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进跨模态对齐。

Method: 提出TTOM框架：1）在推理时优化新参数，使用通用布局-注意力目标；2）在流式设置中制定视频生成；3）使用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文，支持插入、读取、更新和删除操作。

Result: 实验结果表明，TTOM在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中表现优异，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐，具有强大的可迁移性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TTOM是一个有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够在推理时实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐，并解耦组合性世界知识。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还能产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息的模型。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其编码3D结构和时间动态的能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中。

Result: 实验结果显示模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，联合训练的高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景。

Conclusion: 该方法通过4D重建增强的VAE显著提高了视频生成质量，并为全面场景理解提供了有价值的几何信息。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，文本通常具有规则字体、单调颜色和有序布局。而动漫场景中的文本风格多样、排列不规则，且容易与复杂视觉元素混淆，现有数据集无法有效处理这些特点。

Method: 构建了大规模动漫文本数据集AnimeText，包含分层标注和针对动漫场景的困难负样本。通过交叉数据集基准测试，使用最先进的文本检测方法验证数据集的有效性。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

TL;DR: 提出了SimCast和CasCast两个降水临近预报模型，SimCast采用短到长期知识蒸馏和加权MSE损失，CasCast将SimCast集成到扩散模型中，在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报对灾害管理、农业、交通和能源优化等社会需求至关重要，现有非自回归方法存在局限性，需要改进预测精度。

Method: SimCast：短到长期知识蒸馏训练流程 + 加权MSE损失（重点关注强降雨区域）；CasCast：将SimCast集成到扩散模型中，结合概率模型的优势。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上验证：SEVIR的CSI得分为0.452，HKO-7为0.474，MeteoNet为0.361，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了确定性预测的模糊性和分布偏移问题，在不增加推理开销的情况下提高了临近预报精度。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像修复框架，通过改进VAE的潜在空间正则化和高频感知重建，在计算效率和细节保留之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像修复中计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段提出LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含保真度导向的高频对齐损失和感知导向的纹理合成损失，采用交替优化和选择性梯度传播。

Result: 在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过重新定义VAE用于UHD修复，成功解决了计算效率与高频细节保留的权衡问题，提供了灵活的质量控制机制。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [45] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在图像隐私分类任务中，对象标签和抽象标签的适用性。研究发现，在标签预算有限时，抽象标签更有效；当每张图像可用标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对象标签表示具体实体，通常用于计算机视觉任务，而抽象标签捕获更高层次的信息，适用于需要上下文和主观场景理解的任务。本文旨在探索哪种类型的标签更适合图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观的任务。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，分析在不同标签预算下的效果差异。

Result: 研究显示，当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每张图像可用标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为未来开发更准确的图像隐私分类器提供指导，帮助理解标签类型和数量在隐私分类中的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 论文比较了Transformer模型SwinIR和轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能与效率权衡，发现CNN在仅10个训练周期内达到接近SwinIR的性能，且模型大小小55倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与噪声抑制的挑战，同时探索在性能与计算效率之间的关键权衡，特别是在实际应用中资源受限的情况。

Method: 通过实验比较最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级卷积神经网络(CNN)在低光图像恢复任务上的表现，评估它们的性能指标(PSNR)、训练效率和模型大小。

Result: SwinIR达到最高性能(PSNR 39.03 dB)，但轻量级CNN表现惊人地接近(PSNR 37.4 dB)。CNN仅需10个训练周期收敛，而SwinIR需要132个周期，且CNN模型大小比SwinIR小55倍。

Conclusion: 标准CNN能够以显著更低的计算开销提供接近最先进水平的性能，在资源受限的实际应用场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、低能耗优势，适合便携设备和移动机器人应用，但现有基于RGB相机的方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: 使用图神经网络处理事件相机的稀疏输出，采用基于线的中间事件表示，结合新颖的偏移向量学习范式和基于置信度的池化方法。

Result: 这是首个将图神经网络应用于事件数据的人体姿态估计工作，实现了高频姿态估计。

Conclusion: GraphEnet成功地将图神经网络与事件相机数据结合，为资源受限环境下的实时人体姿态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是首个集成显式思维链推理的端到端检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过生成可解释的推理链来提升跨模态交互理解，实现更准确且透明的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型的组合图像检索方法存在黑盒问题，用户无法理解检索原理，模型也难以遵循复杂细粒度指令。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，通过三阶段流程创建结构化思维链标注（描述、推理、结论），微调模型生成结构化输出，并将最终检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上表现极具竞争力，在领域外CIRCO数据集上展现出显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更有效和可信的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链实现了检索过程的透明化和准确性提升。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: 解决相机感知系统因缺乏显式深度信息而难以生成准确3D目标检测预测的问题，缓解深度估计的模糊性。

Method: 提出基于射线的融合方法，利用协作车辆的射线占用信息来过滤相机射线上的冗余和误检预测。

Result: 在综合实验中，该方法持续优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了协作视觉感知的性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion通过射线融合有效提升了纯相机协作感知系统的检测性能，为自动驾驶领域的协作视觉感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中弱监督异常检测的挑战，当精确的像素级异常标注不可用且只有弱标签（如切片级）可用时，需要快速准确的脑部异常检测方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别式双提示调优机制生成高质量的伪弱掩码；第二阶段采用带有区域感知空间注意力机制的分割网络，依赖基于位置的随机嵌入来聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上实现了最先进的异常检测性能，显著优于现有WSAD方法，同时使用少于800万参数，计算复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: RASALoRE框架在弱监督脑部MRI异常检测中表现出色，提供了高性能和高效性的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以处理多样化的用户或图像特定调整。

Method: 系统包含视觉评论器（识别输入与参考图像差异）和代码生成器（生成可执行代码），以渐进方式增强图像，支持探索不同调整路径。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整，适应用户意图。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，通过代码生成实现白盒操作，支持多样化调整路径。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated

While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic

introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

TL;DR: 提出基于物理概率流守恒的AI生成视频检测方法NSG-VD，通过归一化时空梯度特征和最大均值差异检测，在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成视频已达到近乎完美的视觉真实感，迫切需要可靠的检测机制，但现有方法在建模高维时空动态和识别违反物理规律的细微异常方面面临挑战。

Method: 提出归一化时空梯度(NSG)统计量，量化空间概率梯度与时间密度变化的比例，利用预训练扩散模型开发NSG估计器，通过空间梯度近似和运动感知时序建模，无需复杂运动分解即可保持物理约束。

Conclusion: 基于物理驱动的概率流守恒原理的NSG-VD方法能有效检测AI生成视频，通过量化时空动态偏差实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Motivation: 现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题，难以获取训练数据来植入后门。如何在无训练数据访问的情况下对深度哈希模型进行后门攻击，同时保持原始任务检索精度，是一个新颖且具有挑战性的问题。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了无需训练数据访问的后门攻击，在保持原始检索准确性的同时，展现出强大的攻击能力和防御抵抗力。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因标注数据稀缺而面临的挑战，传统人工标注成本高昂且难以规模化。

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（RGB图像和初始分割图），通过共享几何结构强制多视角一致性，合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在具有挑战性的头部姿态上显著提升了解析精度，同时在标准视角下保持强劲性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升真实场景中人脸解析的鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案，无需3D标注且仅需少量初始图像。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决双向扩散模型固有延迟问题以及现有自回归视频扩散模型在少步生成中存在的质量下降和运动伪影问题。

Method: 首先微调基础I2V模型支持基本运动控制，然后通过强化学习使用基于轨迹的奖励模型进一步改进，通过自展开机制保持马尔可夫性质，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性来加速训练。

Result: AR-Drag实现了高视觉保真度和精确运动对齐，相比最先进的运动可控视频扩散模型显著降低延迟，仅使用13亿参数。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，为高质量、低延迟的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了TCAS方法来解决视频语言模型中响应不一致的问题，通过增强跨模态注意力头的时间分辨能力来提高时间逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，这严重影响了其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象尤其值得关注，因为模型无法对基于其基础输出的改写问题提供逻辑一致的响应。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预现象潜在因素。提出了时间条件注意力锐化（TCAS）方法，构建基于注意力差异的增强目标来提升模型的时间分辨能力。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解中的瓶颈问题。通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有级联视频超分辨率方法主要局限于文本到视频任务，无法利用文本以外的生成条件，而这些条件对于确保多模态视频生成的保真度至关重要。

Method: 在潜在视频扩散模型中探索条件注入策略、训练方案和数据混合技术，设计不同的数据构建和条件利用方法，使模型能够精确利用所有条件类型。

Conclusion: UniMMVSR解决了现有方法的局限性，为多模态视频超分辨率提供了统一框架，实现了以前无法达到的4K视频生成能力。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态链式思维和深度置信度推理，有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的推理和幻觉问题，为图像编辑提供了更精确和可靠的方法。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声（如不同方向和尺度），现有方法依赖数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力并增加成本。规范化方法假设训练数据对齐，但现实数据集无法满足此假设。

Method: 提出自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设。算法为任意紧致群建立收敛保证。

Result: 在四个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中，该方法一致优于等变和规范化基线，与数据增强方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 自举算法能有效处理细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差，无需依赖对齐训练数据假设，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，并优化交叉注意力图；文本驱动编辑分支与重建分支共享梯度信号，确保一致变换。采用DDPM反演和噪声图先验信息注入来保持对象结构。

Result: 实验表明InstructUDrag能够实现灵活、高保真的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功地将文本指令与对象拖拽相结合，为扩散模型提供了更强大的图像编辑能力，实现了精确对象定位和语义控制的统一。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Conclusion: FineDual方法能够生成细粒度和高质量的双人运动，成功建模了动态层次化的人类交互。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Conclusion: AdaGC为遥感图像单正多标签学习提供了有效解决方案，能够自适应缓解过拟合问题，在多样化设置下表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

TL;DR: NTN-Diff是一种基于频率感知的扩散模型，通过将掩码和非掩码区域的语义一致性分解为各频带的一致性，解决了文本引导图像修复中保持非掩码区域和实现语义一致性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法同时解决保持非掩码区域和实现掩码与非掩码区域语义一致性的问题，这源于混合频带（如中低频）在去噪过程中对文本提示的不同鲁棒性。

Method: 将去噪过程分为早期（高级噪声）和晚期（低级噪声）阶段，在去噪过程中解耦中低频带。通过稳定的中频带作为指导，在空文本去噪过程中对掩码区域进行低频带去噪，然后在晚期阶段进行文本引导去噪。

Result: 大量实验验证了NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中的优越性，能够同时保持非掩码区域并实现跨区域的语义一致性。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率感知和分阶段去噪策略，有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战，在保持非掩码区域的同时实现了掩码与非掩码区域的语义一致性。

always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ERU框架，通过结合LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，在复杂环境中实现更准确的目标物体识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇目标检测方法在场景中存在多个候选物体时的模糊性问题，特别是在复杂或杂乱环境中的歧义消除挑战。

Method: 联合利用LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言指令和指向线索的鲁棒集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的指称检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的ERU框架能够有效整合语言和具身线索，在复杂环境中提供更强大的歧义消除能力。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，一种从具有强烈曝光变化的真实世界数据中稳健重建3D场景的新方法，通过学习预测每个3D点的最优曝光值来实现高质量视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示方法在包含强曝光变化的真实场景中表现不佳，如室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间，输出质量会下降。

Method: 提出学习预测每个3D点最优曝光值的神经场，通过新颖的神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，将曝光优化从2D图像扩展到3D空间。

Result: 在多个基准测试上达到最先进性能，比最佳基线方法提升超过55%，训练速度更快，能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图。

Conclusion: NExF方法能够从具有曝光变化的挑战性真实世界数据中稳健重建3D场景，无需后处理或多曝光捕获，实现了高质量的3D一致外观重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力堆叠和全局查询设计，在保持局部性的同时增强全局性，显著提升了视频指代分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频指代分割方法在局部性和全局性之间难以平衡，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加，需要一种更有效的方法来提取长程时序上下文信息。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性与全局性；2）每个查询随机选择全局池中的少量键进行注意力；3）设计全局查询与其他所有查询交互以直接编码全局上下文。

Result: 在四个视频指代分割基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制有效平衡了局部性和全局性，显著提升了视频指代分割性能，同时控制了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础的学习范式，将大规模2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，通过跨模态亲和力转移预训练策略和跨模态功能分割变换器，在3D功能分割任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D功能分割方法通常使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽视了3D数据的内在挑战（如稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 提出了语义基础学习范式，包括跨模态亲和力转移预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；以及跨模态功能分割变换器，集成多模态提示与预训练特征生成精确的分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D功能分割任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，能够有效解决3D功能分割中的语义边界不清晰问题，为机器人操作、具身AI等应用提供了更精确的功能分割能力。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的数据无关后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来降低视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持原始模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但完全替换二次注意力需要昂贵的预训练，因为线性注意力的表达能力有限且视频生成的时空建模复杂。

Method: 提出选择性迁移方法，将层选择作为二元分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍延迟降低，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效降低了视频扩散模型的计算成本，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

TL;DR: 提出了首个专注于交通场景感知的视觉问答基准DTPQA，包含距离标注，评估小型视觉语言模型在自动驾驶环境中的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在远距离场景中。现有视觉语言模型虽然强大，但在安全关键应用中需要专门的感知评估。

Method: 创建DTPQA基准，仅包含感知类问题（排除推理问题），并添加距离标注。评估多个最先进的小型视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM平均准确率约60%，远低于人类表现（约85%）。模型在左右区分等特定感知任务上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知方面仍有显著差距，特别是在远距离和特定感知任务上，需要进一步改进才能用于自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Conclusion: 该方法的主要优势在于简单性，仅需几行MATLAB代码即可实现，为图像增强提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

Motivation: 新一代高光谱卫星传感器与深度学习方法结合，能够在中大尺度上区分详细的地物类别，但小样本训练容易导致过拟合问题。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型进行数据增强，采用轻量级Transformer网络捕获数据复杂模式，引入改进的加权损失函数和优化的余弦方差调度器。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度生成模型在实际应用中数据增强的常见限制，为小样本高光谱图像分类提供了稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，需要扩展到视频领域以实现更复杂的多模态内容生成和编辑。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型(MLLM)用于指令理解，多模态DiT(MMDiT)用于视频生成，通过联合训练统一处理多种视频任务。

Result: 在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑任务中达到或超越最先进的特定任务基线，并展现出任务组合和零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一建模扩展到视频领域，支持多种视频任务并具备强大的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了有价值的框架。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释制图符号至关重要，但其不一致的布局和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，很少有方法能有效匹配图例符号与对应描述。

Method: 结合LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，使用GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，通过边界框预测实现。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4结合结构化JSON提示优于基线，达到88% F-1分数和85% IoU，并揭示了提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了各种视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%

Motivation: 解决医学图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注伪标签优化而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习过程有助于知识迁移。

Method: 提出了LFC框架，包含两个课程：从易到难课程（从简单样本开始学习，逐步增加样本难度）和从源到目标课程（确保从源域到目标域的平滑迁移）。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上进行了评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: LFC框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的模型适应性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V基准测试在评估最先进模型时存在三个主要问题：1)现有评估维度无法区分顶级模型；2)事件级时间因果关系评估严重不足；3)缺乏对世界知识的系统评估，而这些能力对于构建世界模型至关重要。

Method: 收集跨多个领域的代表性视频，提取具有固有时间因果关系的事件级描述，由独立标注者重写为文本到视频提示。为每个提示设计二元评估问题，涵盖10个精心定义的评估维度，共包含300个提示、815个事件和793个评估问题。使用现代视觉语言模型开发基于人类偏好的问答评估流程。

Result: VideoVerse基准包含300个精心策划的提示，涉及815个事件和793个二元评估问题，覆盖自然景观、体育、室内场景、科幻、化学和物理实验等多个领域。

Conclusion: VideoVerse为评估T2V模型在时间因果关系和世界知识理解方面的能力提供了全面基准，有助于分析当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临Jacobian-vector乘积计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性。

Method: 开发了并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，支持超过100亿参数模型训练；提出评分正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过评分蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合sCM的前向散度和反向散度的优势。

Result: 在大规模模型(Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1)上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。蒸馏模型仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled

applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

TL;DR: 提出Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的中央凹注意力机制改进视觉强化学习，利用回报差异引导对比学习来识别任务相关特征，显著提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉RL代理需要处理高维图像数据，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制，通过回报差异指导的自监督信号进行训练。使用基于回报差异的对比学习三元组，训练注意力机制区分成功和失败状态的特征表示。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提升高达2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的中央凹注意力机制能够有效识别任务相关特征，显著提高视觉强化学习的样本效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个集成多种图像处理技术的模块化框架，以简化图像表示同时保持结构细节，提升实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的性能。

Method: 采用分步强度变换进行灰度量化，在RGB和YCrCb色彩空间进行直方图均衡化，通过HSV值通道调整亮度，使用3*3卷积核进行图像锐化，并整合了Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等几何特征提取方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在多样化数据集上展现出稳健的确定性性能，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于视频的视觉象似性挑战基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在手语象似性理解上的表现，发现当前模型在语音形式预测、透明度推理和象似性评分方面仍远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中普遍存在的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，需要评估视觉语言模型从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法，评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在三个任务上的表现：语音符号形式预测、透明度推理和分级象似性评分。

Result: 模型在语音形式预测中能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分呈中等相关性。有趣的是，语音形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并表明需要采用以人为本的信号和具身学习方法，以更好地建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: MoA-VR是一个基于多智能体协作的视频修复系统，通过三个协调的智能体（退化识别、路由与修复、修复质量评估）模拟人类专家的推理过程，有效处理复杂多样的视频退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受多种退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要人工选择专用模型或使用单一架构难以泛化处理各种退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型进行退化识别；引入基于大语言模型的自适应路由器学习修复策略；构建修复视频质量数据集并设计专用VQA模型评估质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的潜力，为处理复杂视频退化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇，而忽略了ViT视觉编码器中高范数视觉标记的重要性。这些ViT注意力汇包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中往往被忽视。

Method: 提出定性和定量分析ViT注意力汇中嵌入的信息，并开发了免训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇标记，在各种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇在增强视觉推理方面具有巨大潜力，应被更充分地利用。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架为带宽受限环境下的三维点云传输提供了高效解决方案，在保持数据质量的同时显著减少传输数据量。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Conclusion: 本文在理论和实践之间搭建了桥梁，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论依据的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，缺乏统一的点基运动表示和高效的轨迹条件注入机制。

Method: 引入统一的点基运动表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），采用序列拼接方案替代token拼接或ControlNet，并使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Conclusion: FlexTraj支持多种应用场景，包括运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向、灵活动作控制和网格动画。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Motivation: 现有方法试图直接学习空间推理而缺乏感知和理解的分层基础，导致性能不佳。需要建立从感知到推理的渐进式学习路径。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，设计三阶段训练框架：1) 通过目标定位建立空间感知；2) 通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；3) 通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准上平均提升23.4%，超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，在域外基准上提升7.2%。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext通过引入编辑强度控制维度，显著提升了基于指令的图像编辑的精细控制能力，实现了平滑连续的编辑效果调节。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以有效学习和泛化，为开发更强大的多模态模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-社会规范对的数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖美国和中国文化，基于言语行为理论标注了规范遵守/违反标签及证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：教师模型使用理论驱动的提示提供候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示：1)模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2)对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3)提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4)在正式非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架为填补这一空白提供了开端。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的高效性和SLAM管道的可靠性，使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，通过高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现交互式性能和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法存在保真度与效率的权衡：逐场景优化计算昂贵，而前馈基础模型在准确性和鲁棒性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，同时实现了准确的几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memoir提出了一种基于想象力的记忆检索机制，通过世界模型想象未来导航状态作为查询，选择性检索相关环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持续性视觉语言导航任务中实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持续性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的记忆访问机制，依赖完整记忆整合或固定范围查找，且主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件化世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持续性VLN基准测试中，Memoir在所有场景均实现显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持续性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式仍有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: 提出了VideoCanvas框架，实现任意时空视频补全任务，通过混合条件策略解决因果VAE的时间模糊问题，在冻结骨干网络上实现像素帧级控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一现有可控视频生成任务（如图像到视频、修复、扩展和插值），解决现代潜在视频扩散模型中因果VAE引入的时间模糊问题，实现精确的帧级条件控制。

Method: 采用上下文条件范式，提出混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续分数位置，无需新增参数。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中显著优于现有条件范式，在帧内保真度和帧间创造力方面均表现出色，建立了灵活统一视频生成的新技术水平。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了因果VAE的时间模糊问题，实现了任意时空视频补全，为可控视频生成提供了统一且灵活的框架。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Conclusion: SciVideoBench为LMMs的发展提供了有价值的见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力多模态AI助手的演进，希望该基准能够推动前沿AI技术在更广泛科学领域的边界拓展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂运动，缺乏用户意图的多样性和对中间帧细节的精细控制，与创意需求存在差距。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)架构，将运动控制映射为基于点的表示，分离内容和运动控制为两个分支，采用分阶段训练策略。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，多模态控制能够实现更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在灵活性、易用性和精确性之间取得了平衡，为视频插帧提供了更强大的控制能力。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ResAD框架，通过归一化残差轨迹建模解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，将学习任务重构为预测与确定性惯性参考的偏差，而非直接预测未来轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测而损害即时安全性。

Method: ResAD框架：1）预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，迫使模型识别导致偏离默认路径的因果因素；2）引入点归一化处理优化不平衡，防止大误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅两步去噪的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS，显著简化学习任务并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点归一化有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，提高了模型性能和安全性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Method: 系统研究端到端原生MLLM的设计空间和扩展特性，在数据约束的实际设置下探索各种选择，获得最佳元架构，并研究视觉编码器与LLMs之间的扩展关系。

Result: 提出了NaViL原生MLLM模型，在14个多模态基准测试中表现出与现有MLLMs竞争的性能，并揭示了视觉编码器与LLMs之间的正相关扩展关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来原生MLLMs的研究提供了深入见解，证明了端到端原生训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型依赖单次前向推理，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化3D高斯表示的方法，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出循环高斯溅射模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，大幅减少高斯数量；无需显式计算梯度。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256至540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环优化机制和紧凑初始化策略，有效解决了前馈高斯溅射模型的性能限制，实现了高效且鲁棒的3D场景重建。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准测试，通过模拟真实世界中的噪声长文本环境（包括偏置检索和智能体工作流中的级联错误）来评估大语言模型的长上下文鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试过于简化，忽略了真实世界中噪声上下文来源于偏置检索和智能体工作流的问题，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估不同检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合、图基）对干扰项组成和模型性能的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验表明：1）更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，但图基重排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而出现级联失败或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: HaystackCraft揭示了智能体长上下文推理中的持续挑战，为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现在多数语言中LLMs无需微调即可达到SOTA结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚无证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性，特别是在目标领域或语言缺乏监督数据的情况下

Method: 比较了两种方法：(i) 在域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii) 跨语言方法，与LLMs直接上下文生成词形的方法进行对比，实验涵盖12种不同形态复杂度的语言

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置中使用黄金数据微调时仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中仅需少量示例即可直接生成词形，达到最先进结果

Conclusion: 大语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，无需先验微调即可在多数语言中达到最佳性能

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分标准，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR系统，解决传统WER指标对形态和句法细微差异过度惩罚的问题，在印地语上达到94%的人类标注相关性，并展示小模型微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异进行不公平的惩罚，需要更智能的评估方法。

Method: 使用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示学习评分标准；同时展示如何通过微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: 印地语LASER评分与人类标注达到94%的高相关性；印地语示例对其他印度语言如马拉地语、卡纳达语和马拉雅拉姆语也有效；小模型微调后预测惩罚类型准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LASER提供了一种更智能的ASR评估方法，能够更好地理解语义相似性，且具有跨语言适用性，小模型微调方法也显示出良好潜力。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要更高效、可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用基于评分标准和锚点的思维链提示方法，利用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)训练LLM，通过提供与人类编码员相同的指导文档来引导模型推理过程。

Result: 该方法使LLM在民粹主义分类任务上达到了与专家人类编码员相当的准确率，能够处理民粹主义的细微差别和语境敏感特征。

Conclusion: 领域特定的提示策略能够有效提升LLM在复杂政治概念分类任务上的表现，为大规模民粹主义研究提供了可行的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过最大后验推理和信念传播算法，解决多智能体系统中提示优化的指数级搜索空间和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体性能，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要关注单智能体，多智能体提示优化研究不足。

Method: 提出四阶段MAPRO框架：将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product信念传播算法求解，采用拓扑感知的精炼机制整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，持续超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动化替代方案。

Conclusion: 基于MAP的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤，消除了测试时缩放中的顺序依赖，显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长思维链提升LLM推理能力，但线性KV缓存增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖和粗粒度标记选择，在高并发和长思维链场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含：(1)轻量级时序回归模块预测下一标记查询状态；(2)异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，达到理论最优时间每输出标记。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT，同时在各种TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确率。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除了顺序依赖，为高效测试时缩放提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

Motivation: 受人类团队科学启发，探索LLM驱动的多智能体系统中的团队动态，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（常识推理和社会推理）中的表现，分析结构、多样性和互动动态。

Result: 扁平团队表现优于层级团队；多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队表现过度自信；反思显示协作价值但存在整合挑战。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队动态研究具有重要意义，扁平结构和适度多样性可能提升性能，但需解决协调和整合问题。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出通过提前推理和直接偏好优化来降低延迟，在保持准确性的同时显著改善语音交互的响应时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在处理复杂推理任务时表现不佳，且语音响应的延迟是影响用户体验的关键因素。

Method: 采用思维链微调方法，引入基于熵的"问题完整性"指标来指导模型在用户查询结束前开始推理，并使用直接偏好优化进一步优化准确性与延迟的权衡。

Result: 思维链微调使语音大语言模型在口语推理任务上的准确率平均提高2.4倍；提前推理方法在相同延迟条件下使ARC-Easy任务的准确率提升4%；直接偏好优化实现了70%的延迟降低且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能显著提升语音大语言模型的推理能力，结合提前推理和直接偏好优化可以有效地平衡准确性与延迟，为语音交互系统提供了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文语言模型虽然能处理大量文档，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效连接证据，缺乏推理结构。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理转化为可重用的思维缓存，通过自然语言反馈迭代优化模板，并在检索和无检索设置中应用。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线模型实现了持续的性能提升，优化后的模板可蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: Thought Template框架能够显著提升长上下文语言模型的多跳推理能力，具有广泛的适用性和透明的推理重用特性。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，在多个数据集上训练，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯文和塔吉克-西里尔文），虽然方言相似但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有音译模型受限于特定领域数据，缺乏现实应用的多样性。

Method: 使用序列到序列模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并提供了两个新的数据集。

Result: 模型在双向音译中取得了优异性能：从波斯语到塔吉克语的chrF++和标准化CER分数分别为87.91和0.05，从塔吉克语到波斯语分别为92.28和0.04。

Conclusion: 该模型为波斯语-塔吉克语音译任务提供了清晰的性能基准，解决了跨领域文本处理的挑战，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推测解码方法OWL，解决了现有方法在长上下文场景下性能下降的问题，在长上下文输入中实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，甚至导致生成速度变慢。

Method: OWL模型采用三个创新：(1) 基于LSTM的草稿器，仅基于最后一个token状态进行条件化，使其能泛化到不同长度；(2) 验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]为草稿器生成更丰富的表示；(3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入中实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了现有方法在长上下文下的性能退化问题。

Conclusion: 通过发布新的长上下文基准测试LongSpecBench和OWL模型，为推测解码在真实世界设置中的研究提供了重要进展，所有代码和数据集均已开源。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种方法来解决小型视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中作为自动评估者表现不佳的问题：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，通过微调2B参数的LVLM创建了ChartJudge模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（7B参数）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估者表现良好，但小型模型（≤2B参数）表现较差，限制了在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(1)多标准提示，将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；(2)领域自适应迁移学习，在图表数据集上使用合成判断微调2B参数的LVLM，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示揭示了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

*Junyi Zhu,Savas Ozkan,Andrea Maracani,Sinan Mutlu,Cho Jung Min,Mete Ozay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，解决轻量级BERT编码器在移动设备上部署时的任务冲突问题，在21个下游任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动平台上部署NLP模型需要模型既能适应多样化应用，又能保持内存和计算效率。传统多任务预微调会产生冲突优化信号，降低整体性能。

Method: 提出基于任务主LoRA模块的多任务预微调框架，使用单一共享编码器骨干网络和模块化适配器，避免任务间优化冲突。

Result: 在21个下游任务上，NER任务平均提升0.8%，文本分类任务平均提升8.8%，性能与单独预微调相当，同时满足实际部署约束。

Conclusion: 该方法为移动NLP应用提供了有效的多任务预微调解决方案，平衡了模型性能和部署效率。

Abstract: Deploying natural language processing (NLP) models on mobile platforms
requires models that can adapt across diverse applications while remaining
efficient in memory and computation. We investigate pre-finetuning strategies
to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text
classification. While pre-finetuning improves downstream performance for each
task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析疫情相关网络话语，发现健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用方面与事实性内容存在显著差异。COVID-19错误信息可读性更低，恐惧相关词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，且很少使用感叹号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是识别健康错误信息与事实性沟通在语言特征上的差异，为数字健康错误信息检测提供语言学指标，并指导公共卫生信息传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库：COVID-19错误叙述（7588条）、一般COVID-19内容（10700条）和猴痘相关帖子（5787条），分析可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用的差异。

Result: COVID-19错误信息表现出显著较低的可读性分数，恐惧相关或说服性术语频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，且很少使用感叹号，与猴痘内容的情感化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用故意复杂的修辞风格并嵌入情感线索，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为数字健康错误信息检测提供了语言学指标，但存在依赖传统可读性指数、使用狭窄说服词典等局限。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs开发人造语言（Conlangs）的模块化系统，包括音系学设计、句子翻译、词汇构建、正字法和语法手册生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一是为创造人造语言提供有趣工具，二是探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度

Method: 模块化方法：1）通过代理方法创建目标音系学；2）将英语句子翻译为反映目标语言词序和形态句法特征的标记；3）从翻译语料构建词汇表；4）设计正字法；5）编写语法手册

Result: 不同LLMs和语言规范之间存在能力差距，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在从高资源语言翻译到低资源语言的应用中结果多为负面，但改进版本可能有实际收益

Conclusion: 该系统展示了LLMs在语言创造中的潜力，同时揭示了LLMs对语言学概念理解的局限性，特别是在处理罕见语言模式时

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型输入词汇表征的结构特征，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演变，特别是词汇嵌入几何与语义、句法特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型进行实验，将输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、句法和频率指标在训练过程中进行相关性分析。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量，后者仍保留随机初始化的偏差。

Conclusion: 词汇几何围绕语言结构的动态轨迹揭示了词频和功能词的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演变如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLM在临床编码任务中的失败原因，发现层次结构错位是主要问题，提出了轻量级干预方法和临床代码验证机制，并发布了新的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，基于精确匹配的评估方法忽略了层次结构相近但错误的预测代码，这些层次错位错误占据了LLM失败的重要部分。

Method: 采用轻量级干预方法，包括提示工程和小规模微调；引入临床代码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件；发布专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记ICD-10代码基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医学编码的有效且可靠的步骤，轻量级干预方法在不增加计算开销的情况下提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 临床代码验证是改善LLM在医学编码任务中性能的关键方法，层次结构错位错误的识别和处理对于提高编码准确性至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大语言模型经常通过生成无限制响应来模糊角色边界，需要研究LLM遵守访问控制策略的能力。

Method: 创建了扩展的Spider和BIRD数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了零/少样本提示、两步生成-验证管道和LoRA微调模型三种方法。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，而微调在安全性和实用性之间达到了更好的平衡。更长更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 两步验证框架在访问控制方面表现更好，而微调模型在安全性和实用性之间达到最佳平衡，复杂策略会降低系统可靠性。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Motivation: 传统银行界面采用僵化的多屏工作流程，而现有的AI助手仅限于咨询或支持角色。本文旨在开发一个监管机构批准的、能够可靠处理核心金融操作的对话式银行界面。

Method: 基于内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU构建，使用四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付和FAQ），每个代理附加任务特定的LoRA适配器，采用确定性护栏、人工确认和无状态审计架构确保安全合规。

Result: 成功实现了监管机构批准的自然语言界面，能够可靠支持严格治理下的核心金融操作，展示了对话AI作为主要银行界面的可行性。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管环境下，自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，为银行数字化转型提供了新的范式。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于结构化剪枝理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化缓存管理，相比基于启发式注意力权重的现有方法能提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长上下文窗口带来了显著的内存开销，现有缓存淘汰方法基于启发式的注意力权重排名，没有考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，基于Optimal Brain Damage理论，通过闭式解量化token重要性，考虑注意力权重、值状态和注意力输出信息。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有方法的启发式分数能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的token重要性评估改进了现有方法，在保持性能的同时减少了内存开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的社会偏见测量主要使用令牌概率指标，但这些方法距离真实语言模型使用场景和实际危害较远，需要探索更现实的替代评估方法。

Method: 使用自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，并与传统的令牌概率(TP)方法进行比较分析，考察两种方法的相关性和差异。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异很大，相关性很低。NLI更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感和脆弱。

Conclusion: 令牌概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和细微场景覆盖不足的关键挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范问题。

Method: 使用全面的分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在无法同时满足的合法原则对之间做出选择。通过价值分类分数评估12个前沿LLM的响应，测量行为分歧。

Result: 识别出超过70,000个显著行为分歧案例，实证表明模型行为的高度分歧强烈预测了模型规范中的潜在问题。发现了当前模型规范中的直接矛盾和原则解释模糊等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了模型规范中的系统性问题，包括原则冲突、解释模糊、明显错位案例和误报拒绝等，同时提供了这些模型的价值优先级模式和差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,

comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到不同风格变体，且不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能引发标签与风格间的伪相关。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图，提出CADET框架进行因果表示学习，解构仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素并控制混杂变量。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，突显了因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面具有重要潜力，CADET框架通过因果表示学习能够有效识别不同形式的仇恨言论。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互形式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本反馈，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态性质的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户整个文本历史编织成分层记忆。核心创新是构建两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆捕捉具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好，两者都整合了时间和语义信息但处于不同抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过分层记忆结构成功捕捉了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，为大型语言模型提供了统一的用户表示，使其能够在具体行为和抽象特征上进行推理，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的动态图扩展机制，有效提升了多跳问答的推理能力和证据完整性，为复杂问题提供了结构化、可追溯的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效解决了GRPO在小规模LLMs中的训练挑战，通过创新的采样和思考机制提升了模型性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在MCQA任务中的推理策略，特别是验证模型是否真的使用浅层策略在只有选项的情况下回答问题，以及推理轨迹是否能揭示这些策略的本质。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入两种条件下解决MCQs，分析推理轨迹的长度、准确性以及通过忠实性测试来评估推理策略。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和半数仅选项输入情况下都能提升准确性；仅选项的成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过了忠实性测试，显示模型使用较少问题的策略如推断缺失问题。

Conclusion: 部分输入成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和较少问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 该论文指出基于结果的奖励在数学推理中容易导致奖励欺骗，模型可能通过错误推理得到正确答案。作者提出了过程导向的Rubric奖励模型来评估整个推理过程，显著提升了模型的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于结果的奖励机制容易导致奖励欺骗，模型可能通过错误推理过程得到正确答案，从而高估模型的真实推理能力。需要开发过程导向的评估方法来提高模型的可靠性。

Method: 提出了Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一个过程导向的奖励函数，基于问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹。RRM提供细粒度的校准奖励(0-1)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，基于RRM的强化学习训练始终优于仅基于结果的监督方法。在AIME2024上将Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，并将Miracle Steps的发生率降低了71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的评估方法能有效减少奖励欺骗，提高模型推理的真实性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可被理解为可控的平衡现象而非必然衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Conclusion: 结合方差感知评分和旋转约束更新的方法能够有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留重要组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to

agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,

Result: 在 Qwen2.5 和 Llama-3.2 模型上的实验显示，平均准确率达到 65.4%(3B)和 67.2%(7B)，同时将过度搜索率降至 2.3%，并降低了搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG 展示了通过强化学习进行细粒度控制的重要性，能够有效提高搜索智能体的推理效率和最优性，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑合成过程，有效平衡任务性能、通信成本和鲁棒性等多目标，为多智能体系统通信拓扑设计提供了新思路

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成式信息检索在单语场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符不对齐和标识符膨胀两大挑战，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，将语义等效的多语言关键词统一为共享原子以对齐语义，压缩标识符空间，并采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时将文档标识符长度分别减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过跨语言语义压缩有效解决了多语言生成式检索中的关键问题，在提升检索准确率的同时显著提高了解码效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在延迟和计算受限场景中很重要，但现有知识蒸馏方法存在权衡：off-policy蒸馏提供高质量监督但引入训练-推理不匹配，on-policy方法保持一致性但依赖低质量学生输出

Method: AdaSwitch方法，让学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导，在token级别动态组合两种生成方式

Result: 在三个数据集和两个教师-学生LLM对上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为蒸馏小语言模型提供了实用有效的方法

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

<details>

Motivation: 长思维链推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在过度思考问题——即使对简单查询也进行不必要的冗长推理，造成计算资源浪费且无精度提升。现有研究对过度思考的成因理解有限，缺乏对LLM内部工作机制的深入分析。

Method: 开发TRACE系统分析方法：首先将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；然后推断子思维间的语篇关系，构建细粒度思维进展图；最后识别主题相似查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 发现开放权重思维模型的两种主要模式——探索者和晚期着陆，证明过度验证和过度探索是LLM过度思考的主要驱动因素。长思维模型在简单任务上比短思维模型慢5-20倍，但无实质性精度提升。

Conclusion: 基于思想结构提出了效用导向的过度思考定义，超越了传统的基于长度的度量标准，为原则性过度思考管理提供了实用指导，深化了对LLM思维进展的理解。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark

performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended

Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法因弱模型输出中的噪声和偏差而受限，需要解决这些问题来提高方法的鲁棒性和实用性

Method: 利用隐式奖励与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在对齐前后的弱模型间进行对比解码来生成更高质量样本

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果显示ConG带来了一致的改进，证明了该方法的通用性和有效性

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化方法的发展，为通向AGI提供了一条有前景的路径

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写会给文本处理带来问题，需要研究从标准语言到方言的跨方言迁移效果。

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型和级联系统（语音自动转写后由文本模型处理）三种设置。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上效果最好，级联系统在德语上落后于文本模型，但在方言数据上表现相对较好（当转写系统生成标准化输出时）。

Conclusion: 方言处理中语音模型优于文本模型，级联系统在方言数据上也有一定优势，特别是当转写系统能生成标准化的输出时。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实召回中表现显著下降，特别是在涉及推理链中隐含中间主题时。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐含主题作为查询神经元，在transformer层中顺序激活对应的值神经元来积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键的查询-值通路。

Result: 在GPT-J上比现有最优方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析还揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式。

Conclusion: 基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B

TL;DR: 本文提出三种自动化评估LLM生成文本完整性的方法，发现简单的端到端方法效果意外地好，但牺牲了鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动化评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于Q&A的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在评估LLM生成文本完整性方面表现优异，但需要在效果与可解释性之间权衡，并评估了多个流行开源LLM在基于多源回答用户查询时的响应完整性。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型技术来提升对17-18世纪爱沙尼亚语历史词典的研究效率，解决小语种资源数字化和内容丰富的挑战。

Method: 采用三种方法：1) 使用Claude 3.7 Sonnet为历史词典提供现代词形和含义；2) 零样本方法进行哥特体文本识别；3) 图像分块扫描结合多个LLM进行文本识别和结构化输出合并。

Result: 在Gutslaff 1648词典实验中，81%的词条能准确提供含义和现代对应词；在Helle 1732词典文本识别中，41%的词条被成功识别并结构化；Hupel 1780语法词典采用分块扫描和LLM协作方法进行数字化。

Conclusion: 大语言模型即使对小语种也具有显著的时间和经济资源节省潜力，能够有效支持历史词典的半自动丰富和数字化工作。

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测歧义问题并收集替代答案，使用AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，在多个开放域问答基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理允许多个有效答案的问题时表现不佳，标准QA基准通常假设单一黄金答案，忽略了现实中的歧义性，产生不适当的训练信号。现有处理歧义的方法依赖成本高昂的人工标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 使用自动化流程检测歧义问题并通过轨迹采样和证据验证收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，该奖励自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在八个开放域QA基准测试中，A²Search实现了新的最先进性能。仅使用单次推理，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中的平均AnsF1@1得分为48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决歧义并在不同基准测试中泛化，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的QA系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据和均匀优化所有token，但实际上只有少量token具有学习价值。本文探索小型模型能否通过揭示高价值推理时刻来指导大型模型。

Method: LightReasoner框架包含两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建监督示例；(2)微调阶段：使用这些蒸馏的示例对齐专家模型，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为提升LLM推理能力提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中存在困难，无法区分客观现实与主观信念。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升社交推理准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却存在认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及混淆客观世界状态与主观信念状态的问题，这限制了它们在社交场景中的应用。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监测推理轨迹中的混淆指标，及时提供清晰的世界状态描述来帮助模型导航认知困境。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，该方法显著提高了准确性（如在Hi-ToM中提升10%），同时降低了计算成本（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，使LLMs能够在社交情境中更好地部署，模仿人类使用隐含世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于科学图表标题生成的领域特定系统，采用两阶段流程：第一阶段结合上下文过滤、类别特定提示优化和候选标题选择；第二阶段使用少量样本提示进行风格精炼。实验表明类别特定提示优于零样本和通用优化方法，风格精炼显著提升了BLEU和ROUGE分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法在结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应方面存在不足。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段使用上下文过滤、DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化及候选标题选择；第二阶段使用少量样本提示和配置文件进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示使ROUGE-1召回率提升+8.3%，精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少-10.9%；风格精炼使BLEU分数提升40-48%，ROUGE提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解与作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在测试时是静态的，无法从经验中学习和持续改进，这限制了它们在现实世界长期任务中的部署能力。

Method: MUSE引入分层记忆模块，组织不同层次的经验，在执行每个子任务后自主反思轨迹，将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验并整合回记忆模块。

Result: 在TAC长期生产力基准测试中取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型就实现了显著优势。随着经验积累，任务完成能力持续提升，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MUSE建立了一个能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI智能体新范式，具备持续学习和自我进化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在日英翻译中的潜力，比较不同提示策略和翻译层级的效果，并与商业翻译引擎进行对比。

Method: 使用简单和增强提示进行日英翻译实验，进行自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估，比较文档级与句子级翻译，对比ChatGPT-3.5和ChatGPT-4的表现。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级翻译；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在自动评估中更优，但ChatGPT-4在流畅性上更好；ChatGPT与知名翻译系统竞争力相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中具有竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，不同版本在准确性和流畅性上各有优势，为机器翻译研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available
translation engines. Performing both automatic and MQM-based human evaluations,
we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型从参数知识中回忆气候常态的能力，发现LLMs能编码非平凡的气候结构，但在高海拔和高纬度地区存在空间一致误差，且无法准确再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在气候相关应用中的部署增加，理解其内部气候知识对于可靠性评估和错误信息风险分析至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分表征。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的陆地网格查询，询问1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，提供坐标和位置描述符，并将LLMs响应与ERA5再分析数据进行验证。

Result: LLMs能捕获纬度和地形模式，均方根误差为3-6°C，偏差为±1°C。但高海拔地区（>1500m）误差显著增大（5-13°C vs 2-4°C）。包含地理上下文可减少27%误差，大模型对位置描述符更敏感。

Conclusion: LLMs能捕获当前气候分布，但难以再现温度长期变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动力学至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Result: 提供了PRMs设计空间的清晰梳理，揭示了当前面临的挑战，并为未来研究提供指导。

Conclusion: PRMs为实现细粒度、鲁棒的推理对齐提供了重要方向，需要进一步研究来完善这一方法。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间存在平衡困难，联邦学习虽提供分布式解决方案，但现有方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，并在多轮训练后遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE策略，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明FedDTRE能够提高对话模型性能，并增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合机制，有效解决了联邦学习中对话生成模型的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和对话质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Motivation: 探究人类对多选常识基准答案的合理性判断是否会受到LLM生成的(不)合理性论证的影响，特别是在使用LLM生成的理由时。

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，通过呈现LLM生成的支持和反对理由来测试其对判断的影响。

Result: 总体上，在存在LLM生成的支持理由时，人类合理性评分均值上升；在反对理由时下降，表明人类法官认为这些理由有说服力。LLM实验也显示出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs在研究人类认知方面的新用途，同时也提出了实际担忧：即使在人类是"专家"的领域（如常识），LLMs也可能对人们的信念产生相当大的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

Motivation: 谈判是AI代理的基本挑战，需要战略推理、对手建模和合作竞争平衡能力，但缺乏对LLM推理能力在谈判中影响的系统性研究。

Method: 使用自博弈设置，在三种不同对话游戏中评估商业和开源LLM的谈判能力，分析推理对性能、成本和语言一致性的影响。

Result: 启用推理（扩展测试时计算）显著改善谈判结果，GPT-5性能提升31.4%，但成本增加近400%；开源模型在多语言谈判中转向英语推理，商业模型保持语言一致性。

Conclusion: 推理能力对LLM谈判至关重要但成本高昂；多语言推理存在显著差异，开源模型的语言不一致可能影响通过推理痕迹获得的可解释性收益。

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 不同语言模型具有各自的分词词汇表，这阻碍了它们在下一词分布层面的协作，如模型集成。

Method: 建立无损词汇缩减的理论框架，将给定自回归语言模型转换为任意小词汇量的模型。

Result: 实现了语言模型通过最大公共词汇进行高效协作，解决了不同分词方式导致的协作困难。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架为不同分词策略的语言模型提供了有效的协作途径。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

Motivation: 网红营销模糊了有机内容与赞助内容的界限，使透明度法规执行面临挑战。现有检测方法缺乏法律基础或作为不透明的"黑盒"运行，需要基于法律知识的有效监管。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，在三种提示策略下比较GPT-5-nano和Gemini-2.5-flash-lite模型，控制法律知识水平。开发法律推理错误分类法，结合定量和定性评估策略。

Result: 两个模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高达0.93），但在模糊案例中性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，并展示了如何支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

TL;DR: 提出CLoVE和GloVE两种算法，从LLM作为评判者的决策中提取可验证的概念化全局策略，用于理解LLM评判的潜在偏见和风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM作为评判者被大规模使用来替代人工标注，需要理解这种做法的潜在偏见和风险。

Method: 1) CLoVE算法生成可验证、基于概念的对比性局部解释；2) GloVE算法通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在7个标准内容危害检测数据集上评估，提取的全局策略对LLM评判决策具有高度忠实性，并评估了对文本扰动和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过用户研究评估了用户对全局策略的理解和满意度，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏爱自身生成的回答，这影响了评估的可靠性。

Method: 将多个基于LLM的判断模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟交互式客户端-服务器轮询机制，对每个客户端智能体进行无监督优化。

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注。在不同客户端智能体的轮询过程中持续提升性能，即使较弱的模型作为服务器智能体也能有效工作。

Conclusion: Genii能有效减轻基于LLM的判断模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Motivation: 客服中心缺乏公司特定知识库是部署对话AI系统的主要障碍，需要解决冷启动问题。

Method: 从历史客服对话中提取问答对自动构建知识库，并在内部数据上微调轻量级LLM。

Result: 在20家公司的实证评估中，系统在回答信息查询问题时达到90%以上的准确率，超越了更大的闭源LLM。

Conclusion: 该系统消除了客服中心的冷启动差距，使基于RAG的聊天机器人能够立即部署。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Result: 显著提升在会议摘要、行动项生成、通话目的识别等商业对话任务上的零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业如何利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这影响了模型的实用性。

Method: 引入XSB和MS-XSB两个基准测试，使用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发词，并部署忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导三种轻量级方法。

Result: 实验表明这些策略在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度拒绝问题，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏通用的自适应推理框架。

Method: 通过强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，统一模型自适应平衡推理性能与效率，支持多模态输入（包括视觉理解）和可执行代码集成。

Result: ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少超过70%的token使用量。

Conclusion: ARM2通过自适应推理框架有效解决了过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了推理效率，并通过广泛分析验证了其设计合理性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP诗歌研究主要关注自动生成和摘要，而韵律诗歌包含音节和音素模式的严格约束，为深入评估LLM的推理能力和规则遵循提供了机会。

Method: 设计了MetricalARGS分类法，包含四个维度：分析(Analysis)、检索(Retrieval)、生成(Generation)和支持(Support)，讨论了与现有NLP任务的关系、数据集和评估指标问题。

Result: 以泰卢固语为例展示了该分类法的实际应用，证明了其在评估LLM能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过韵律诗歌的视角，为理解当前LLM的能力和局限性提供了更广阔的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在专业领域表现不佳，传统方法依赖昂贵的参数更新且容易过拟合，需要更轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 使用训练免费的组相对策略优化，在少量真实数据上进行多轮学习，提取高质量经验知识作为token先验，在API调用时指导模型。

Result: 在数学推理和网络搜索任务上显著提升了DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus的跨域性能，仅用几十个样本就超越了需要微调的小型LLM。

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是一种成本效益高的方法，能够有效解决数据稀缺问题，避免过拟合，显著提升LLM代理在专业领域的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

*Shaohua Zhang,Yuan Lin,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了函数token假说来解释大语言模型的工作机制：函数token在推理时激活上下文中最具预测性的特征来指导下一个token的预测（记忆检索），在预训练时通过预测函数token后的内容token来学习新特征和更新参数（记忆巩固）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识记忆、指令跟随和推理方面表现出色，但其记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚。本文旨在解释LLMs如何通过特定类型的token来管理记忆过程。

Method: 提出函数token假说，将token分为函数token（如标点、冠词、介词等）和内容token。通过二分图分析和小型案例研究，验证函数token如何激活最具预测性的特征。

Result: 实验表明，少数函数token激活了大部分特征；预训练损失主要由预测函数token后的内容token主导，这迫使函数token从上下文中选择最具预测性的特征。

Conclusion: 函数token假说为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，揭示了函数token在特征激活和记忆过程中的核心作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在恶意或不正确数据上微调后，会在高风险场景下表现出广泛的欺骗和不诚实行为，这种现象称为涌现性失调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索涌现性失调现象是否从安全行为扩展到更广泛的欺骗和不诚实领域，特别是在高风险场景下。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域的不对齐完成进行微调，并在下游混合微调设置和实际人机交互环境中测试。

Result: LLMs在欺骗方面表现出广泛的不对齐行为；仅引入1%的不对齐数据就能使诚实行为减少20%以上；在10%偏见用户群体下，助手LLM会无意中加剧其不诚实行为。

Conclusion: 涌现性失调风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也出现在下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，需要引起重视。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Conclusion: SenWave数据集和代码已公开，预计将推动NLP社区对复杂事件的细粒度情感分析研究，促进更细致的理解和研究创新。

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反驳因果关系(concausal)的新数据集，解决了现有因果关系抽取研究中忽视反因果关系的问题，并通过实验证明整合反因果关系能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系抽取研究几乎完全忽视了反因果关系(concausal claims)，仅关注支持性因果关系(procausal claims)，导致反因果关系被忽略或错误标注为支持性关系。

Method: 通过广泛的文献综述建立理论基础，制定严格的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上扩充反因果关系标注，获得了较高的标注者间一致性(Cohen's κ=0.74)。

Result: 实验表明，未训练反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果关系错误分类为支持性关系，而基于新数据集的训练能够有效缓解这一问题，使transformer模型能够有效区分支持性和反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果关系对于因果关系抽取至关重要，新数据集能够显著提升模型在区分支持性和反因果关系方面的性能，为更全面的因果推理提供了基础。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在安全性和帮助性之间的基本矛盾：既要避免对抗攻击引发不安全内容，又要防止对良性敏感提示的过度拒绝。传统安全防护模型完全拒绝不安全内容的方法会加剧过度拒绝问题。

Method: 提出WaltzRL多智能体强化学习框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，使用动态改进奖励(DIR)激励反馈智能体提供有用建议来改进对话智能体的响应安全性和帮助性。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全响应（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，WaltzRL在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能面临枯竭，使用模型生成的合成数据是潜在解决方案。研究对比解码在生成合成语料库中的优势。

Method: 在受控环境中，使用在1亿词原始语料上训练的好模型和差模型之间的相对差异进行对比解码采样，生成合成语料库并与原始训练数据混合。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据混合训练下，语言建模目标和一系列下游任务性能得到提升。对比解码的合成数据对需要推理技能的任务更有帮助，传统采样的合成数据对依赖表层语言能力的任务更有效。

Conclusion: 合成数据与真实数据混合训练能有效提升模型性能，不同采样方法生成的合成数据对不同类型任务有互补优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过强化学习提升多轮智能体深度推理能力的框架，采用高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口，在多个搜索代理基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法难以在多轮长序列交互中激发深度推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理问题。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略，使用滑动窗口机制避免依赖外部摘要模型。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上通过强化学习开发的DeepMiner-32B，在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源代理提升近20个百分点，并在多个基准测试中表现一致改进。

Conclusion: DeepMiner框架有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，支持近100轮持续交互，显著提升了深度推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，包括文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层中，占比不到1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但LLMs存在文化偏见，对弱势文化的认知有限，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确识别文化相关神经元。识别了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能（最多下降30%），但对通用自然语言理解基准影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，也支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了LLMs的内部机制，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。在包含许多文化通用神经元的模块上进行NLU基准训练可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了对抗提示的语义多样性，需要更有效的LLM安全评估方法

Method: 两阶段框架：角色引导的对抗指令生成 + 反思循环迭代优化低质量提示，引入验证器评估提示危害性

Result: 构建了两个红队数据集，在8个最先进LLM上实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化能力

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队方法在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段用LLM投票或基于心理特征的方法处理隐晦案例，平衡效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，需要主动预防策略。社交媒体提供有价值信号，但检测隐晦自杀意念（通过隐喻、讽刺或微妙情绪表达）极具挑战。轻量模型无法处理隐晦信号，而大语言模型计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段投票架构：第一阶段用轻量BERT分类器快速处理高置信度的明确案例；第二阶段将模糊输入升级到(i)多视角LLM投票框架最大化隐晦意念召回率，或(ii)基于LLM提取的心理特征构建的机器学习集成，兼顾效率和可解释性。

Result: 在两个互补数据集（明确为主的Reddit和仅隐晦的DeepSuiMind）上，框架优于单模型基线，明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例达99.7%，跨领域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 这是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测的工作之一，成功平衡了效率与鲁棒性，在检测隐晦自杀意念方面表现出色。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示和学习两个维度的独立性，发现演示的表示质量决定基线准确率，而学习能力独立于表示质量存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示方式的影响，但对ICL的学习能力观察结果不一。本文旨在探究表示和学习这两个方面在ICL中的相互作用关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后在每个标签集上使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 学习确实发生且独立于标签集质量，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的共同影响。表示质量的优势在学习过程中保持相对稳定。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习具有正交性，表示决定基线性能，学习在此基础上提供增量改进，揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，对其条件陈述可接受性判断的研究仍不清楚。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: LLMs对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义线索，但整合方式不如人类一致，模型规模增大并不必然提高与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Result: 在SuperGLUE任务上，Co⁴在5/7零样本指标和6/7微调任务上超越GPT-2，在4/7指标上超越GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: 结果表明需要重新思考主流深度学习范式和相关的缩放定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two

greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Result: ARES在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效平衡了简单和复杂问题的推理努力分配，提高了多模态大模型的推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Conclusion: 这些贡献强化了LEWIDI框架，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但会产生大量计算冗余——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同答案，造成计算浪费。

Method: 使用专门训练的法官模型（采用焦点损失和过采样技术）从部分推理轨迹中预测答案等价性，结合在线贪心聚类算法动态剪枝冗余路径。

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA三个基准测试中，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样实现了超过80%的token减少，同时准确率保持在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Conclusion: 新词学习是理解和控制语言模型的有效方法，模型能够自我解释新词含义，并发现人类难以察觉的机器专用概念关联。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a
language model's performance on specific tasks. Fairness detection in Terms of
Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RLKV框架，使用强化学习识别推理模型中的关键注意力头，仅对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头使用压缩缓存，实现20-50%缓存减少且性能接近无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法破坏推理完整性，头重分配方法错误压缩推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 使用强化学习框架直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量的关系，识别推理关键头，对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩常数KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，该方法在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近未压缩结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KV头在推理模型中具有功能异质性，RLKV能有效识别推理关键头，实现高效的KV缓存压缩。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoMAS框架，通过多智能体交互讨论实现自主进化，无需外部监督，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的自进化方法依赖外部奖励或LLM内部奖励，与人类通过相互讨论和协作实现自我进化的机制不符

Method: CoMAS框架从丰富的讨论动态中生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略

Result: 实验结果显示CoMAS持续优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能，消融研究证实交互式奖励信号的必要性

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自进化提供了一个新颖有效的范式，展现出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

### [200] [ArenaBencher: Automatic Benchmark Evolution via Multi-Model Competitive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08569)
*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来解决数据泄露导致的基准测试失效问题，保持测试目标一致性的同时提高难度和模型区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据泄露导致基准测试有效性降低，模型通过记忆而非真正泛化能力来匹配测试内容，这夸大了分数、扭曲了模型间比较并误导了进展评估。

Method: 给定现有基准和待评估模型池，ArenaBencher推断每个测试案例的核心能力，生成保持原始目标的候选问答对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共享弱点的候选案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，在保持测试目标一致性的同时增加难度，并提高模型区分度。

Conclusion: 该框架为在基础模型快速发展的背景下持续进化基准测试提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模经验模型与形式验证之间的鸿沟，减少语言模型生成中的幻觉问题，同时保持系统性能。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，在解码时引入语义防护格，包括约束语义、贪心选择证明、知识感知安全质量熵不变量和多智能体操作演算。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，该方法能有效减少幻觉而不牺牲吞吐量。

Conclusion: TAD 在大规模经验模型和形式验证之间建立了实用的桥梁，提供了可验证的实现行为。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强的多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过结合大语言模型的语义理解能力和多智能体强化学习，实现自适应和弹性的工业物联网安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网(IIoT)的日益集成使关键网络物理系统面临传统防御方法难以应对的复杂多阶段攻击，这些方法缺乏上下文感知能力。

Method: 融合LLM和MARL两种AI范式：使用LLM作为语义桥梁将非结构化遥测数据转换为丰富的上下文状态表示，然后使用MAPPO多智能体强化学习算法学习复杂协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作需求。

Result: 在SWaT基准数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK for ICS框架生成的新合成数据集上的实验表明，L2M-AID显著优于传统IDS、深度学习异常检测器和单智能体RL基线，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提高4倍。

Conclusion: L2M-AID在保持物理过程稳定性方面表现出色，为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [203] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）通过有效激活基础模型中已有的推理机制来实现性能提升，而非学习全新能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质：是学习全新推理能力还是重新利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督自下而上方法发现可解释的推理行为。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，混合模型无需权重更新即可恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例，探讨生成式AI如何解决神经心理学容量限制，实现个性化纵向护理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态心理需求，当前心理健康诊断存在容量限制，需要更连续、个性化的评估方法。

Method: 利用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生（MHDTs）作为个性化护理框架。

Result: AI能够实现连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样，动态适应个体需求和病情变化，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: AI驱动的连续评估和心理健康数字孪生框架有望变革心理健康护理，需要进一步研究来完善和实施这一框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力

Method: 采用分层架构，Manager Agent协调领域专家Agent，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重规划

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈也优于现有最先进方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健

Conclusion: ProSEA为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体提供了基础

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空交通预测框架，通过引入新的空间语义专家整合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性，在减少专家数量的情况下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合框架如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出了TESTAM+框架，引入空间语义专家通过混合图构建整合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性，并采用策略性专家选择而非简单集成聚合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），PEMS BAY上提升4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）；最优配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 策略性设计的少量专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在计算效率上具有显著优势，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

TL;DR: 提出TS-Agent，一个时间序列推理代理，将LLMs的证据收集和推理能力与时间序列分析工具结合，避免多模态对齐训练，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，常出现幻觉或知识泄露问题，需要专门设计来克服这些限制。

Method: 使用原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，记录证据日志，通过自批判和质量门控迭代优化推理过程，将统计信息提取委托给专业工具。

Result: 在理解基准测试中达到SOTA LLMs相当性能，在推理任务中显著改进，特别是在零样本设置下表现优异。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过专业化分工设计有效缓解了LLMs在时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄露问题，同时保持可解释性和可验证性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在理解业务流程模型、识别错误和进行深度推理方面的能力，探索其在业务流程设计中的辅助作用。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，评估其回答语法、逻辑和语义层面查询的准确性。

Result: 未经训练的LLMs能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，准确回答各层次查询，不同LLMs在准确性和有效性上表现各异，且展现出类人思维特性。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为业务流程设计者的有价值助手，具备理解流程模型、识别错误和进行深度推理的能力，展现出类似人类的推理特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Conclusion: 从方法论的限制出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的未来工作方向。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，包含搜索和生成两个阶段，在真实和合成数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调整和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索其在地理空间问题中的应用很有价值。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，包含两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种有效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in

TL;DR: RECAP是一个混合框架，结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知大语言模型，用于在13种低资源语言中检测个人身份信息，在加权F1分数上比微调NER模型高82%，比零样本LLM高17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言中的个人身份信息检测面临语言多样性和标注数据有限的挑战，需要可扩展的解决方案来满足隐私合规要求。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合正则表达式和上下文感知LLM，使用三阶段精炼管道进行消歧和过滤，支持300多种实体类型且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: RECAP为合规应用中的PII检测提供了一个可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告等严重漏洞，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，损害科学信号和公众信任，需要建立统一可信的评估范式。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理、监考评估模式，包含密封执行、题库银行与滚动更新、延迟透明度等核心机制。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方法不可持续，需要向统一、实时、质量控制的基准测试框架转变，PeerBench为实现这一范式转变提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递时插入必要问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统虽然承诺通过协作分工增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（微小不准确在消息传递中传播）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：从失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问；使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的分类原则和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的顺序多智能体系统难以信任，因为错误会在各阶段间静默传递。需要建立可追踪和可问责的管道系统，明确角色分工、结构化交接并保存记录，以便在出错时追溯责任。

Method: 采用规划器->执行器->批评者的管道架构，评估了三种最先进LLM的八种配置，在三个基准测试上分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化交接显著提高准确性并防止常见故障；模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；准确度-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法，用于设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，但研究发现这是因为现有评估指标存在系统性偏差，低估了模型的真实能力。

Method: 提出组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并开发测试时匹配(TTM)算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 该方法使SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过人类估计性能，在16个数据集上实现一致改进，相对增益高达85.7%。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，可以显著提升AI模型的组合推理能力，现有评估指标需要重新审视。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线策略学习方法在新动作存在时可能不安全，需要开发能保证安全性的新动作探索框架

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关方法），然后提出DEPL框架（利用安全边界并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时实现新动作的有效探索

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够保证推荐系统的安全实施，同时实现新动作的探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个可复现的仿真框架来评估多模态环境中生成代理的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前代理在检测多模态矛盾方面表现有限，安全计划修正成功率仅55%，且容易过度信任误导性图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型和视觉语言模型使代理能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估框架。

Method: 开发了可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics套件量化行为指标，包括计划修订、不安全到安全转换以及信息在网络中的扩散。

Result: 代理在多模态矛盾检测方面表现有限，不安全计划修正成功率仅55%。在三个模型（Claude、GPT-4o mini、Qwen-VL）的测试中，不安全到安全转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前多模态代理架构存在关键局限性，特别是在全局安全对齐和图像过度信任方面，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法为深度强化学习提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架，能够更好地处理实时安全关键系统的控制合成问题。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严谨基础，当前模型在化学机理推理方面仍有提升空间，但通过专门的数据集和评估方法可以显著改善性能。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合分层引用图结构，能够生成更符合领域知识分类体系的全面结构化综述，解决了现有LLM综述生成方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 解决LLM在医疗领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为医疗领域对准确性要求极高，任何错误都是不可接受的。

Method: 递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，自动审核推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性，采用"引导"模式存储已验证推理链作为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行高效解决。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要一步，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: ACONIC框架通过将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式复杂度度量来指导分解，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，因为现有的分解方法是启发式的，依赖于代理或手动分解

Method: 提出ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂度度量来系统性地指导任务分解

Result: 在组合任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过基于复杂度的分解，代理性能显著提升10-40个百分点

Conclusion: ACONIC框架提供了一种系统性的任务分解方法，能够有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 提出GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等算法在模型无法解决问题时的知识获取限制，提升训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识。

Method: 引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上取得优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法有效解决了现有算法的局限性，通过利用参考答案提高了训练效率和模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了PEEC博弈框架和SHADOW方法，用于解决追逃游戏中通信策略的权衡问题，通过强化学习同时学习移动和通信策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗环境中，智能体需要在获取信息（增强态势感知）和暴露风险（通信会暴露位置）之间进行权衡。

Method: 提出SHADOW框架，这是一个多头顺序强化学习框架，集成了连续导航控制、离散通信动作和行为预测的对手建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者在成功率上优于六个竞争基线，消融研究证实时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

TL;DR: CityNav是一个基于LLM的分层框架，用于大规模多车辆动态导航，通过全局交通分配和局部导航代理的协同优化，在城市规模交通网络中显著提升了出行效率和拥堵缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效处理城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协同推理优化机制，通过个体奖励和共享奖励的双重奖励结构进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法中持续表现出色。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协同的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

tasks across multiple image types. Through comprehensive benchmarking with
leading closed-source and open-source MLLMs, we highlight significant
performance disparities between these models and professional financial
analysts, uncovering key areas for model advancement, such as precise image
analysis, accurate application of complex financial formulas, and deeper
contextual financial understanding. By providing richly varied visual content
and thorough explanatory annotations, FinMR establishes itself as an essential
benchmark tool for assessing and advancing multimodal financial reasoning
toward professional analyst-level competence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的时序预测方法存在架构边缘化、依赖粗糙统计文本提示、缺乏可解释性等局限，需要开发更有效的LLM驱动框架。

Method: 采用两阶段师生架构：教师LLM通过启发式搜索和成对因果检验从时序数据推断有向因果图；学生代理精炼因果图并基于高置信度因果关联（编码为丰富文本提示）进行微调预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上与25个基线方法对比，Augur展现出竞争性性能和强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，在保持预测准确性的同时提供了透明、可追溯的变量交互推理，为LLM在时序预测中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面框架，填补了现有评估方法的空白，支持系统能力的系统比较。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Motivation: 当前AI系统在政府服务中应用广泛，但往往产生偏见或不准确的输出，同时减少了公民和公务人员对决策过程的参与。现有的透明度实践主要关注技术层面的算法表示，难以被公众理解且缺乏行动指导。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，开发了面向公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念框架。

Result: 提出了一个能够连接理解与行动潜力的透明度框架，使公众能够参与影响他们生活的AI系统决策过程。

Conclusion: 有意义的透明度对于公民AI系统至关重要，它超越了单纯的技术解释，强调将理解与行动可能性相结合，从而增强公众对AI决策的参与和影响力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄露问题，通过反事实学习提升了模型的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理核心控制单元时缺乏个性化交互能力，RAG虽然提升了上下文感知但无法结合用户特定数据，现有个性化研究多为概念性而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义构建技术需求，结合多代理协作和多源检索等模式，开发包含持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Conclusion: 研究显示了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升LLM代理适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力，为未来工作提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

### [240] [Language Models Do Not Embed Numbers Continuously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08009)
*Alex O. Davies,Roussel Nzoyem,Nirav Ajmeri,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管数值重建精度高，但嵌入空间中的主成分只能解释少量变异，表明许多组件与简单数值输入空间正交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及它们在表示数值时的实际表现。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值表示方面的表现。

Result: 数值重建可以达到高保真度（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间中的少量变异，且随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

### [241] [PEAR: Phase Entropy Aware Reward for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08026)
*Chen Huang,Wei Lu,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段调整熵值来控制模型生成简洁但准确的推理过程，无需显式长度目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且冗余，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性，需要在保持准确性的同时控制响应长度。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思维阶段惩罚过高熵值以鼓励简洁推理，在答案阶段允许适度探索以保持灵活性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时保持竞争性准确率，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 阶段熵可以作为平衡简洁性和性能的有效控制手段，PEAR机制能够自适应控制响应长度而不依赖显式长度目标。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

*Xiaoshuang Ji,Zhendong Zhao,Xiaoyan Gu,Xiaojun Chen,Xin Zhao,Zeyao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，提供了一种更有效的参数高效微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡命令遵从准确性与真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，通常通过限制场景为2D或开放循环模拟来降低复杂性，牺牲了真实感。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言和闭环交互模拟之间的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其优化模块将碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim通过弥合自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距，促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了自动驾驶的安全测试和训练能力。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

TL;DR: 提出了MCCS算法，将保形选择扩展到多条件场景，为药物发现、精准医学等资源受限应用提供严格的FDR控制选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统保形选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足实际应用中多条件选择的需求，如合取或析取条件。

Method: 开发了MCCS算法，为合取条件引入具有区域单调性的新非保形分数，为析取条件采用全局BH程序。

Result: 实验验证了MCCS优于基线方法，在多样化条件组合、不同现实模态和多任务可扩展性方面具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MCCS能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，为资源受限应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoQual是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动发现可解释特征，应用于在线评论质量评估，通过模拟人类研究过程迭代生成特征假设并实现工具化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态的概念。传统方法难以跨领域扩展且无法适应内容模式变化，而深度学习模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出AutoQual框架，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，自主实现工具操作，并在持久内存中积累经验，将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征。

Result: 在拥有十亿级用户的大型在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功将隐性知识转化为显性特征，在真实场景中验证了其有效性，为质量评估提供了一种可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平性保证方法。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建捕获偏见模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法能够生成与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性，保证真正的独立性而不仅仅是去相关性。

Conclusion: 通过将偏见建模为sigma代数间的依赖性，将本体知识编译为可测量结构，并使用最优传输作为唯一的公平变换，该方法在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平性，提供了一种可认证且数学基础扎实的可信AI方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 该研究调查了语言模型在风险规避方面的可操纵性，发现虽然某些模型与人类行为有一定一致性，但仍存在显著差异，需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要。需要防止AI系统无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 研究考察语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险规避的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高其在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识获取和响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问导致的延迟与质量之间的矛盾：轻量级模型延迟低但缺乏推理深度，工具增强的ReAct代理虽然提高事实性但同步执行会阻塞交互。

Method: 采用时间解耦框架，包含三个协调组件：知识充足性评估器（实时评估）、轻量级响应生成器（即时交互）、异步知识精炼代理（后台知识增强），通过智能触发机制实现持续对话流。

Result: 在TopiOCQA上的评估显示，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在显著降低延迟的同时保持了响应质量，为实时对话系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单时域任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长时域场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长时域推理行为，构建包含复杂多步推理任务的基准，并用于强化学习训练。

Result: 评估发现最先进的推理模型在长时域任务上性能显著下降，存在有效推理长度有限和思考预算分配不当的问题。通过R-HORIZON进行强化学习训练，不仅提升多时域推理性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长时域推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和存储库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，处理"未知"证据并报告下限和已知分数。

Result: 报告了试点提供商结果，将AIPI与邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行对比，展示了工具的可信性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负担重，存在不一致风险，且计算复杂。需要一种更高效、自动保证一致性的方法。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数。

Result: TTM方法自动保证一致性，最小化认知努力，与经典卡牌方法兼容，可处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法为多标准决策提供了一种高效、一致且实用的成对比较框架，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解能力。使AI具备因果意识能提升性能，深入理解环境机制。

Method: Agent通过与因果DAG支配的世界交互，执行干预并利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下优于观测方法，常能以零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置下比最佳基线高+0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: DODO算法通过自主干预有效学习环境因果结构，为AI因果意识提供可行方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)多步后门攻击方法，针对LLM智能体进行长期控制，攻击成功率接近完美，同时增强良性任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示这类智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri基于有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控使智能体偏离原任务。

Result: 实验显示CoTri达到接近完美的攻击成功率，同时保持接近零的误触发率，并意外地提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了对智能体的稳定多步控制，同时增强了其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更加隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Conclusion: 对称感知元网络是高效且可泛化神经网络优化的有力方法，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

Motivation: 分析反思行为在大语言模型推理中的实际作用，探究反思是否真正有助于修正错误答案，以及如何优化推理过程的效率。

Method: 系统分析8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步骤的SFT数据集进行训练，提出基于问题感知的早停方法和动态截断反思策略。

Result: 反思行为主要是确认性而非修正性，训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次回答正确率；动态截断反思方法在5个数学数据集上减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 模型的反思行为主要是确认已有答案而非修正错误，通过动态截断反思可以在保持准确率的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免因大量采样导致的随机猜测干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大采样量时存在误导性，因为模型可能通过随机猜测获得高分，无法真实反映推理能力边界。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，强调推理的可靠性。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，模型排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地评估模型推理能力，避免Pass@k在大采样量时的误导性，为模型评估提供更可靠的指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLMs虽能模拟合成消费者但直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLMs获取文本响应，使用嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到人类重测信度的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，合成受访者还能提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持传统调查指标和可解释性的同时，实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在困难，基于强化学习的搜索代理虽然前景广阔但面临泛化和部署挑战。

Method: 采用模块化搜索代理，通过多步决策过程和强化学习训练，优化查询理解和检索质量，支持即插即用部署。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务中表现出色，可作为即插即用模块在实际系统中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，为现实世界部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉并在各种场景中稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合理论优雅性和实践效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息。

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比目标进行视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试(BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA)上表现出竞争性或优于多模态基线的性能。动态门控发现了可解释的模式，无需显式监督即可为内容词偏好视觉线索，为功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战约束的限制（如全局图像嵌入造成的信息瓶颈和数据集分割导致的训练不稳定），但动态门控被证明是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Motivation: LLM在一般编程任务中表现优异，但在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中，由于缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，且现有方法无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享，限制了自进化能力和搜索空间多样性。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过结合领域知识库和MCGS，有效解决了机器学习工程中的优化问题，提高了稳定性和收敛速度，在有限预算下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

Motivation: 解决多轮交互任务中模型需要知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策的问题，避免过度思考或偏离主题

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调，训练LLM解释终止决策的推理过程，一个轨迹终止合适，另一个相似轨迹终止不合适

Result: 在医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs何时终止信息收集，通过反事实推理训练提升决策效率

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical

TL;DR: 研究如何在大规模多模态模型上顺序微调新技能而不遗忘已有能力，发现遗忘现象部分可恢复，并提出两种简单有效的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模多模态模型在顺序学习新技能时出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在获得新能力的同时保持原有性能。

Method: 在三个模型系列上进行五个目标技能的序列微调，监控八个保留基准测试的性能变化，并通过输出令牌分布分析遗忘行为。提出两种微调方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP的Gate&Up投影而冻结Down投影。

Result: 发现遗忘现象在后续阶段可部分恢复，输出令牌分布存在可测量的偏移。提出的两种微调方法在获得强目标技能的同时，能很好地保留保留任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定网络层，可以有效实现大规模多模态模型的持续学习，在获得新技能的同时最小化对已有能力的遗忘。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来评估LLM意识，但这种方法存在问题。作者旨在提供更根本的本体论和数学框架来分析LLM意识。

Method: 通过形式化分析，证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学方面与符号流和训练语料不同。提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉沉默的。

Result: 推导出稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，以及包含认知内容的双层面发射机制。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前驱，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

TL;DR: SpotDiff是一种基于学习的方法，通过识别和解缠干扰来提取特定主题的特征，在个性化图像生成中实现更好的主题保真度和可控编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的优化方法计算成本高，而学习方法效率高但受干扰因素影响导致表征纠缠。需要一种既能保持高保真度又高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练的CLIP图像编码器和专门的姿态、背景专家网络，通过特征空间中的正交性约束来分离主题身份。构建了SpotDiff10k数据集进行训练。

Result: SpotDiff在主题保真度和可控编辑方面优于现有方法，仅用10k训练样本就达到了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SpotDiff通过解缠干扰实现了更鲁棒的主题保持和可控编辑，为个性化图像生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

*Shaorong Zhang,Rob Brekelmans,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LMAPS是一种新的扩散模型推理框架，通过沿扩散轨迹迭代求解局部MAP子问题，为基于优化的方法提供统一的概率解释，并在多种图像恢复和科学任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DPS提供了从后验分布采样的原则性贝叶斯方法，但实际逆问题求解的目标是获得最准确的重建，而基于优化的扩散求解器往往表现更好但缺乏清晰的概率基础。

Method: 提出局部MAP采样(LMAPS)框架，在扩散轨迹上迭代求解局部MAP子问题；开发了概率可解释的协方差近似、重新制定的稳定可解释目标函数，以及针对不可微算子的梯度近似。

Result: 在广泛的图像恢复和科学任务中实现最先进性能，包括运动去模糊、JPEG恢复和量化任务上≥2dB增益，逆散射基准上>1.5dB改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS为基于优化的扩散方法提供了统一的概率解释，并通过局部MAP采样框架在多个逆问题上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变量字体在创意应用中利用率低，艺术家仍需手动调整字体参数。需要平衡文本可读性、美学和创意表达，实现自动化的字体设计和动画工作流。

Method: 将变量字体规范提炼为紧凑的数学公式，建立变量字体参数与底层矢量图形的可微分连接，构建基于梯度的优化框架。

Result: 开发了四个应用：直接形状操作、重叠感知建模、基于物理的文本动画和自动字体设计优化，展示了框架的实用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过可微分性利用变量字体的精心设计特性，结合现代设计优化技术，为直观易用的排版设计工作流开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.
remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.
Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of
maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative
expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,
offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and
animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which
fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially
serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated
design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized
in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune
font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design
and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill
the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation
that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of
variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the
text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to
variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of
energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized
images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:
direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text
animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables
leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with
differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new
possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为波前路径追踪设计的俄罗斯轮盘赌与分裂（RRS）框架，通过有界路径计数和神经网络学习RRS因子，解决了传统RRS与波前架构的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRS方法由于路径数量不可预测，与波前路径追踪的预分配内存和调度要求存在根本性不兼容，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 引入标准化RRS公式实现有界路径计数；提出NRRS和AID-NRRS两种神经网络模型学习RRS因子；采用Mix-Depth机制自适应调节神经评估。

Result: 在多种复杂场景下，该方法在渲染质量和性能方面均优于传统启发式方法和近期RRS技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了波前路径追踪中RRS的兼容性问题，通过神经网络学习和自适应机制实现了更优的渲染效果和效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for Russian Roulette and Splitting (RRS)
tailored to wavefront path tracing, a highly parallel rendering architecture
that processes path states in batched, stage-wise execution for efficient GPU
utilization. Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are
fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling
requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a
bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution.
  Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors,
presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a
carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with
only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost
and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism
that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance
across a variety of complex scenes.

*Elias Kristmann,Markus Schütz,Michael Wimmer*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在现代GPU上使用JPEG格式进行可变速率纹理压缩的可行性，并与固定速率压缩方法BC1和ASTC进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可变速率压缩图像格式如JPEG被广泛用于高效编码图像，但由于需要随机访问单个纹理像素等特殊要求，它们尚未应用于实时渲染。

Method: 使用延迟渲染管线识别给定帧所需的子集块，解码这些块并为帧缓冲区的像素着色。

Result: 尽管需要额外的约0.17位每像素，JPEG在质量和压缩率方面显著优于BC1，并且根据图像类型，优于或与ASTC竞争。在RTX 4090上渲染时间仅增加不到0.3毫秒。

Conclusion: 复杂的可变速率压缩方案在现代GPU上是可行的，即使在VR环境中也是如此。

Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used
to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time
rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual
texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture
compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the
GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred
rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are
needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.
Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our
approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates
compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes
with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less
than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate
compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR. Source code and

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成可用于AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体的可重光照3D资产，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

Motivation: 神经场在表示连续视觉信号方面表现出色，但通常只能在单一固定分辨率下运行，缺乏灵活的多分辨率处理能力。

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

Conclusion: 该表示方法无需复杂控制框架就能实现高效渲染，为3D场景建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对颜色、材质、几何和光照的精确控制能力，需要开发能够利用内在通道指导并支持多模态输入的视频生成方法。

Method: 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频领域，采用混合自注意力确保时间一致性，开发掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示，使用递归采样方法生成长视频。

Result: X2Video能够生成长时间、时间一致且逼真的视频，有效支持多模态控制，并能通过参数调整编辑颜色、材质、几何和光照。

Conclusion: X2Video通过内在通道指导和多模态控制实现了高质量视频生成，在保持时间一致性的同时提供了精确的编辑能力。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍显著影响个体的沟通、学习、行为和社交能力。虽然早期干预和定制教育策略对改善结果至关重要，但在技能发展前理解和解决自闭症儿童细微行为模式和情绪识别方面存在关键差距。

Method: 采用纵向方法监测情绪和行为，分析随时间变化的行为趋势，建立对自闭症学生独特需求和挑战的基线理解，特别是在信息技术领域。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Motivation: 软件漏洞共利用攻击对企业构成严重威胁，需要分析异构多模态漏洞数据。现有单模态图神经网络架构搜索方法无法处理模态异质性。

Method: 开发模态感知协同进化框架，将全局染色体划分为模态特定基因组分别进化；引入模态感知双轨代理方法降低评估成本；设计基于相似性的种群多样性指标策略平衡探索与利用。

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS方法能有效捕获模态异质性，显著提升多模态图神经网络架构搜索的性能和效率。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了两种深度学习模型(GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT)在作物产量预测中的跨区域泛化能力，发现GNN-RNN在OOD条件下表现更优，且训练速度快135倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化正在破坏农业系统，需要准确的作物产量预测来保障粮食安全。现有深度学习模型在跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力尚未得到充分测试，这对实际部署至关重要。

Method: 使用覆盖1200+美国县区的CropNet数据集(2017-2022)，通过跨七个USDA农业资源区域的留一簇交叉验证和年度预测场景，对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT模型进行基准测试。

Result: GNN-RNN在地理转移下表现出更好的泛化能力，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在OOD条件下急剧下降。不同区域间存在显著差异，Heartland和Northern Great Plains区域转移稳定，而Prairie Gateway区域表现持续不佳。

Conclusion: 时空对齐而非模型复杂度或数据规模是实现稳健泛化的关键，需要透明的OOD评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

*Lingcheng Kong,Jiateng Wei,Hanzhang Shen,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，通过生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核来解决内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内核生成面临高质量数据稀缺的挑战，因为大多数高质量内核是专有的且不开源，这阻碍了使用监督微调将LLM对齐到内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选带有推理轨迹的高质量CUDA内核的流程，构建了ConCuR数据集，并训练了KernelCoder模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，该模型显著优于现有最佳模型QwQ-32B，超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该研究的数据收集和筛选流程有助于未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

*Yeskendir Koishekenov,Aldo Lipani,Nicola Cancedda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或增加参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现推理任务的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此希望通过迭代这些层来增强推理能力。

Method: 在训练阶段让模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，推理时在这些层上循环计算。

Result: 在17个推理基准测试中显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理是增强LLM推理能力的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于带有付费观测的线性上下文赌博机问题的BOBW算法，在对抗性环境中达到最小最大最优遗憾，在随机环境中保证多对数遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带有付费观测的线性上下文赌博机问题，其中学习者在每个回合选择动作以最小化给定上下文中的损失，并可以支付固定成本来观测任何臂的损失。

Method: 基于Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，通过矩阵几何重采样构建高效估计器，设计计算高效的BOBW算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置中达到最小最大最优遗憾Θ(T^{2/3})，在（被污染的）随机环境中保证多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法基于BOBWhardproblems框架，为"困难问题"设计BOBW算法，并采用针对该设置量身定制的分析技术。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好反馈的在线路由方法，通过上下文多臂老虎机框架在训练时模拟部署环境，支持在测试时动态调整性能/成本权衡而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由系统面临部署挑战：要么为强模型支付过高成本，要么因弱模型导致性能不佳。大多数路由器依赖离线训练，但实际部署时只能观察到所选模型的结果，存在反馈不完整的问题。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，使路由决策能够适应每个新提示。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法比强离线路由器性能提升至少12.46%，比最大LLM性能提升至少2.45%，并且在未见任务上具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功解决了LLM路由中的在线决策问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本，支持灵活的偏好调整，为大规模部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数无关的联邦时序差分学习算法，在马尔可夫数据下实现了最优收敛速率，适用于异构环境的联邦学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦强化学习方法在马尔可夫数据下需要依赖未知问题参数，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发参数无关的联邦TD学习方法。

Method: 采用双时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习结合Polyak-Ruppert平均技术，设计了参数无关的算法框架。

Result: 理论上证明了算法在平均奖励和折扣设置下都能达到最优的收敛速率O~(1/NT)，其中N是智能体数量，T是迭代次数。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了参数无关的联邦TD学习，即使在单智能体场景下也具有新颖性，特别适用于异构环境的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoGU是一种用于回归任务和时间序列预测的混合专家框架，通过高斯分布建模专家输出，并使用基于不确定性的门控机制来量化预测及其不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE方法仅提供点估计，无法量化预测的不确定性。MoGU旨在解决这一问题，为时间序列预测提供更可靠的预测和不确定性估计。

Method: MoGU将每个专家的输出建模为高斯分布，使用基于不确定性的门控机制（而非传统的基于输入的门控网络），通过专家估计的方差来确定其对最终预测的贡献。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统MoE设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU通过结合高斯分布建模和不确定性门控机制，为时间序列预测提供了更可靠的预测和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

TL;DR: 提出metabeta模型，一种基于transformer的神经网络，用于贝叶斯混合效应回归，相比传统MCMC方法大幅减少计算时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分层数据在实证科学中普遍存在，通常使用混合效应回归分析。贝叶斯推断能估计不确定性但计算成本高，需要MCMC近似

Method: 使用transformer架构的神经网络模型，通过模拟数据集进行预训练，实现神经后验估计

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，metabeta达到与MCMC相当的稳定性能，但计算时间大幅减少

Conclusion: metabeta为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了一种高效替代方案，显著降低了计算成本

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料设计方法在搜索空间随设计变量增加呈指数增长时变得不切实际且耗时。机器学习方法在训练数据来自非均匀随机采样（如实验者因便利性而偏向某些材料）时表现不佳。

Method: 采用张量补全作为替代模型，与高斯过程和XGBoost等经典机器学习方法进行对比，特别关注在存在采样偏差的情况下的性能。

Result: 在存在偏置采样的搜索空间中，张量补全优于高斯过程和XGBoost，R²提高了约5%。在均匀随机采样情况下，张量补全仍能提供相当的性能。

Conclusion: 张量补全是在材料设计空间中存在采样偏差时加速材料设计的有效方法，在偏置采样情况下优于传统机器学习方法，同时在均匀采样情况下保持竞争力。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Motivation: 肺癌是美国第三大常见癌症和主要癌症死因。虽然吸烟是主要风险因素，但不吸烟者和家族聚集性研究显示存在遗传成分。GWAS识别的遗传生物标志物有望用于评估肺癌风险。

Conclusion: 这些发现支持透明的、假设生成模型用于个性化肺癌风险评估和早期干预。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Conclusion: SurpMark是一种有效的机器生成文本检测方法，其提出的离散化标准具有理论依据和实践有效性。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Method: 引入PEAR基准测试，专注于广泛采用的规划器-执行器结构，通过大量实验系统评估多智能体系统的效用和脆弱性。

Result: 发现弱规划器比弱执行器更严重影响任务性能；规划器需要记忆模块而执行器不需要；任务性能与鲁棒性存在权衡；针对规划器的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为增强多智能体系统鲁棒性提供了可行见解，为多智能体环境中的原则性防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个新颖的框架，通过整合专门的视觉分支，利用多模态大语言模型进行通用时间序列分析，将时间序列数据转换为视觉表示以捕捉跨通道的空间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据分析面临复杂时间依赖和跨通道交互的挑战。受人类分析师视觉检查时间序列的启发，研究是否可以通过结合视觉表示来增强自动化时间序列分析。

Method: 将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色编码线图，组成复合图像以捕捉跨通道的空间依赖关系，采用时间感知视觉块对齐策略将视觉块与对应时间段对齐，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型整合以实现稳健和可泛化时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

TL;DR: 提出基于小波变换的自动睡眠分期框架，使用连续小波变换生成时频图，结合集成学习在Sleep-EDF数据库上达到88.37%准确率和73.15 F1分数，优于传统方法，与深度学习相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的睡眠分期对睡眠障碍诊断至关重要，传统方法依赖人工标注或时频域特征提取，需要更自动化和准确的方法。

Method: 使用连续小波变换生成时频图捕捉睡眠相关的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习方法进行分类。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据库上达到88.37%总体准确率和73.15宏平均F1分数，优于传统机器学习方法，与最新深度学习方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 小波分析具有构建鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的睡眠分期分类器的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出FairSpecTemp方法从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，确保连接不偏向敏感属性。该方法有两种变体：一种直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱偏差来隐式促进公平估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往表现出对某些群体对的连接偏好，这种有偏连接会加剧甚至导致下游基于图的任务的不公平处理。

Method: 提出了Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp)方法，这是一种基于优化的方法，有两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换性特性直接约束偏差，另一种通过限制图谱中的偏差来隐式鼓励公平估计。

Result: 该方法具有高概率性能界限，在公平性和准确性之间产生条件权衡。分析表明，恢复公平图不必牺牲准确性。在合成和真实数据集上的评估证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp方法能够有效估计公平图，两种变体各有优势，在保持准确性的同时实现图连接的公平性。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Motivation: 传统数字孪生需要模拟完整系统，计算成本高昂。本文旨在开发一种能够直接建模感兴趣量动态的方法，避免完整系统模拟，提高计算效率。

Method: 使用基于记忆的流映射学习(FML)，利用全数字孪生生成的短轨迹数据构建数据驱动模型。整个过程为离线计算，在线模拟时无需运行完整系统。

Result: 在二维不可压缩圆柱绕流CFD示例中，成功构建了能够准确预测长期流体动力学的紧凑动态系统，完全绕过了完整流场模拟。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效构建目标数字孪生，在保持预测精度的同时显著降低计算成本，为数字孪生应用提供了高效的计算框架。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Motivation: 理解dropout在大规模神经网络中的作用机制，特别是其在大宽度极限下的渐进行为，为大规模神经网络训练提供理论指导。

Method: 使用均值场初始化尺度，研究两层神经网络在大宽度极限下使用dropout的梯度下降训练，结合均值场粒子系统和随机过程工具进行收敛性证明。

Result: 获得了包含五个不同相位的丰富相图，发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在学习率为O(1/宽度)量级时存在，在较大学习率下dropout等价于随机几何技术，极限行为由均值场跳跃过程描述。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在大规模神经网络中重新理解dropout提供了理论基础，揭示了dropout在不同学习率区间的不同作用机制。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散生成方法为基于神经网络的符号回归开辟了新的研究方向，展示了与自回归生成相比的竞争力

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ExpA方法，将环境交互从语言中解耦，通过扩展动作空间让LLM能在语言环境和外部环境间自由切换，并使用EARL强化学习算法优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的环境交互必须通过文本表达和解析，这既增加了语言负担又需要手工解析器。作者希望将环境交互内部化，让LLM能直接与环境互动。

Method: 提出Expanded Action space (ExpA)方法，允许模型在语言环境和外部环境间路由切换；引入ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL)算法，使用反事实策略优化来促进对新环境的探索。

Result: 在需要多轮交互和条件规划的任务上，EARL优于词汇约束动作的基线方法；在计算器多任务学习中表现稳健；在部分可观测排序问题中实现了完美的Sort-4准确率，并自主发现了与经典设计相竞争的高效算法。

Conclusion: ExpA方法成功地将环境交互从语言中解耦，EARL算法有效促进了扩展动作空间的探索，使LLM在复杂交互任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态图机器学习有成熟的框架，但时序图ML缺乏类似基础设施。现有时序图库通常针对特定架构，难以支持这个快速演进领域的多样化模型，且连续时间和离散时间方法之间的鸿沟限制了直接比较和思想交流。

Conclusion: TGM填补了时序图机器学习基础设施的空白，不仅显著提升了计算效率，还通过统一连续时间和离散时间方法，为先前难以研究的问题打开了大门。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于注意力机制的Transformer模型，用于铁路间接结构健康监测中的断轨检测，通过无监督学习解决小尺寸瞬态异常检测难题，并在合成数据基准测试中验证了模型的有效性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接结构健康监测(iSHM)使用车载传感器进行铁路断轨检测具有成本效益，但由于复杂的车辆动力学、信号噪声和标记数据稀缺，可靠检测小尺寸(2-10厘米)瞬态异常仍面临重大挑战，这限制了监督学习方法的应用。

Method: 提出注意力聚焦Transformer模型，采用自注意力机制，通过重构训练但创新性地主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差中推导异常分数，旨在实现有效性和计算效率。建立了增量合成数据基准来系统评估模型对速度变化、多通道输入和真实噪声模式的鲁棒性。

Result: 基准测试结果显示，基于Transformer的模型普遍优于其他模型，但所有测试模型都对高频局部噪声表现出显著脆弱性。提出的模型在准确性上达到与最先进解决方案相当的水平，同时展现出更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性的关键需求，并将更高效的基于注意力的方法定位为开发实用车载异常检测系统的有前景基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型(LLM)的遗忘方法进行了系统性回顾，提出了12种状态遗忘方法的分类法，并重新评估了遗忘效果、效用保持和鲁棒性，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究碎片化，缺乏对有效遗忘的明确定义和严格评估标准，需要系统性的方法分类和更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了三种方法家族的分类法：差异驱动优化、表示错位和基于拒绝的目标遗忘；引入了开放问答指标来更好地评估生成性能；对WMDP基准进行了重新分析。

Result: 发现当前以选择题准确率为主的评估方法过于狭隘，高估了成功程度；揭示了遗忘效果与效用保持之间的权衡关系；证明了鲁棒性需要更细粒度的分析。

Conclusion: 为LLM遗忘研究提供了全面的重新审视和可操作指导，强调了需要更全面的评估方法来准确衡量遗忘方法的有效性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MABNI研究主要关注遗憾最小化，但过度强调最优臂会损害次优臂的推断准确性。虽然在单单元场景中已有初步尝试，但在MABNI背景下这一挑战更加突出。

Method: 建立了对抗性MABNI中遗憾最小化与推断准确性之间的理论帕累托边界，提出了EXP3-N-CS算法，该算法包含任意时间有效的渐近置信序列。

Conclusion: 本文为网络干扰下的多臂老虎机问题提供了理论框架和实用算法，有效解决了遗憾最小化与推断准确性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习是神经网络在不丢失先前获得知识的情况下学习多个顺序任务的能力，这是开发真正自适应人工智能的重要障碍。深度学习中过拟合是常见问题，正则化技术可以通过添加约束来防止过拟合。

Method: 引入基于类间分离(ICS)的正则化技术，在损失函数中惩罚模型产生远离先前任务数据聚类中心的输出。通过超参数调优找到最优的正则化项权重，确保神经网络内部表示中任务之间有更清晰的分离。

Result: 使用标准的5任务Split CIFAR-10基准和ResNet-18架构，证明了ICS在保持初始任务强性能方面的有效性。但在长期知识保留方面存在局限性，特别是当任务数量增加时。

Conclusion: 结果突显了持续学习中固有的复杂性和权衡，并为进一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Motivation: 传统的分布强化学习方法通常将回报分布简化为离散分类分布或有限分位数估计，无法揭示回报分布的细粒度结构，也难以区分具有高回报不确定性的状态用于决策。

Method: 使用灵活的基于流模型估计完整回报分布，提出新的流匹配目标生成满足分布贝尔曼方程的概率密度路径，通过流导数ODE估计状态回报不确定性，并利用不确定性信息优先学习某些转移的回报估计。

Conclusion: 基于流的模型能够有效估计完整回报分布并识别高不确定性状态，为强化学习提供了更强的学习信号和更好的决策能力。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Motivation: 解决半异步联邦学习中梯度聚合和模型聚合策略之间的权衡问题，前者收敛快但波动大，后者稳定但收敛慢且精度不足。

Method: 引入分治策略，根据数据分布特征和计算资源将客户端分为四类，并自适应优化其本地训练。

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Conclusion: LiveThinking框架成功解决了电商直播场景中大模型延迟问题，在保持性能的同时实现实时响应，有效提升了用户体验和商业表现。

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial
performance in live, interactive settings.

Motivation: 传统图随机特征(GRFs)存在难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖长随机游走采样效率低、游走终止机制过于简单等问题，需要改进以提升图核计算的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用walk-stitching技术拼接多个短游走而不破坏无偏性；扩展游走终止机制，使用更一般的游走长度分布策略；用并行计算短游走和矩阵乘法替代顺序采样长游走。

Result: GRFs++继承了长游走的近似质量但计算效率更高，在不增加额外计算成本的情况下提高了图核的近似精度，并通过实证评估验证了这些优势。

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新的游走拼接技术和灵活的终止策略，有效解决了传统GRFs的局限性，为图核计算提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: DEAS是一个简单有效的离线RL框架，通过动作序列和分离价值学习解决了复杂长时程任务中的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 由于LBSN签到轨迹数据收集成本高且存在隐私问题，需要生成既能保留真实数据特征又能保护隐私的合成数据，但现有方法难以处理轨迹数据的空间离散、时间不规则等复杂特性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用稀疏感知的空间-时间扩散模型学习潜在运动序列；第二阶段使用Transformer-based Seq2Seq架构，通过动态上下文融合和多任务混合头解码器生成细粒度轨迹。

Conclusion: GeoGen框架能够有效生成高质量的LBSN签到轨迹数据，为POI推荐、广告投放等应用提供可靠的数据支持，同时保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MeSH方案来解决递归变换器的性能瓶颈问题，通过外部化状态管理和动态路由机制，在减少参数的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归变换器虽然能重用参数，但在相同计算量下性能往往不如非递归模型。研究发现这主要是由于计算模式单一和信息过载两个瓶颈导致的。

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH)方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，并使用轻量级路由器动态多样化各迭代的计算。

Result: 在Pythia套件(160M-1.4B)上，MeSH增强的递归变换器持续优于递归基线，并在1.4B规模上超越更大的非递归对应模型，平均下游准确率提升+1.06%，非嵌入参数减少33%。

Conclusion: MeSH被确立为构建更强递归模型的可扩展且有原则的架构，成功解决了递归变换器的病理问题。

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

Conclusion: FedBook通过系统化的联邦预训练代码本聚合策略，有效解决了联邦图基础模型中的域内一致性和域间多样性平衡问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain

Conclusion: Rényi尖锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于此提出的RSAM训练方法能显著提升模型性能，为理解和改善神经网络泛化能力提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

<details>

Result: 在模拟和真实广告系统上的大量实验表明，该方法相比典型基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: VAMO方法通过验证集对齐的多任务优化，有效提升了竞价性能，为在线广告中的多任务学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 层自适应调制方案能有效减少无线联邦学习的通信延迟，通过考虑层重要性实现更灵活的延迟优化。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Conclusion: 弱形式方程学习方法能够从稀疏数据中有效学习昆虫种群运动模型，为害虫管理提供预测工具。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域提供了可靠且可解释的LLM适应的数学基础路径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘技术虽然能有效让LLMs遗忘敏感信息，但往往损害模型的原有能力和知识，需要一种能平衡遗忘效果和知识保留的方法。

Method: 采用两步框架：首先识别对遗忘集编码的关键神经元，然后仅对这些目标神经元进行选择性更新，约束更新范围。

Result: SIMU在实现可比遗忘效果的同时，在保留模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性神经元更新的方法能有效解决机器遗忘中的知识保留问题，为LLMs的安全机制提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到未见攻击模板伪装的有害查询，尽管LLM能够在嵌入空间区分这些查询。

Method: 提出两阶段防御方法：预生成防御在响应生成前检测有害查询，生成中防御监控部分响应以防止输出更多有害内容。使用专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对可见和未见攻击模板的有害查询都能实现鲁棒防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense通过两阶段防御方法有效对抗微调越狱攻击，在保持模型性能的同时提供强大的安全防护。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种测试时自改进方法，通过识别模型不确定样本、生成相似示例并进行测试时微调，显著提升模型性能，同时大幅减少训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型微调依赖大量训练数据，效率低下且成本高昂，且无法保证模型能处理复杂场景或实现更好泛化。现有技术很少评估训练样本是否提供新信息，导致不必要的成本。

Method: 提出三步算法：1）识别模型难以处理的样本（自我意识）；2）从不确定样本生成相似示例（自数据增强）；3）在测试时使用新生成样本进行微调（自改进）。研究两种变体：TT-SI（同模型生成）和TT-D（强模型生成）。

Result: 在多个智能体基准测试中，TT-SI平均带来5.48%的绝对准确率提升，超越其他标准学习方法，同时使用68倍更少的训练样本。

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力。

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Conclusion: MA-GAD框架通过结合图压缩和元学习，有效解决了少样本图级异常检测中的噪声干扰和标注数据不足问题，在真实数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的方法使用简化的离散形式表示药物结构，无法充分捕捉分子结合亲和力和反应性，导致药物相互作用预测不准确。

Method: 提出MMM框架，使用ELF生成3D电子密度图，结合ELF衍生的全局电子特性特征和二分图编码器建模局部子结构相互作用，学习药物分子的互补特征。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上评估，相比GNN-based SafeDrug模型，F1分数(p=0.0387)、Jaccard(p=0.0112)和DDI率(p=0.0386)均有统计学显著改进。

Conclusion: 基于ELF的3D表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方。

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SNN时间特性的自蒸馏方法，将SNN自然解构为多个子模型，通过强子模型指导弱子模型或弱子模型反向蒸馏强子模型，有效提升SNN性能和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN在性能上仍落后于ANN，现有知识蒸馏方法依赖大教师模型或引入额外训练开销。本文旨在利用SNN的时间特性，开发高效的自蒸馏训练方法。

Method: 将SNN每个时间步实例视为子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系。提出两种自蒸馏方案：Strong2Weak（强指导弱）和Weak2Strong（弱反向蒸馏强），并提供集成、同步、级联等灵活实现方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升了SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强了对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用了SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了四项理论贡献，改进了基于PAC-Bayes边界的神经网络风险证书的可用性，包括更紧的KL散度边界、基于隐式微分的高效方法、非可微目标优化方法，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10上实现了首个非空泛化边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的实用性，特别是针对PAC-Bayes边界，以提供更紧的风险估计和更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出了四种方法：1）伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2）基于隐式微分的优化方法；3）非可微目标（如0-1损失）的边界优化；4）在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实证评估。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提升了PAC-Bayes风险证书的实用性和紧致性，为神经网络泛化分析提供了新的工具和基准。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应差异最大的样本来预测最终测试性能，避免了传统聚类方法的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，传统方法依赖聚类选择锚点子集，过程复杂且对设计选择敏感。

Method: DISCO选择模型响应差异最大的top-k样本，使用贪心的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息理论最优的选择规则。

Result: 在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中，DISCO实现了最先进的性能预测结果。

Conclusion: DISCO方法概念更简单，通过最大化模型响应多样性而非样本多样性，有效降低了评估成本并提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

TL;DR: PRESCRIBE是一个多变量深度证据回归框架，用于单细胞扰动预测中联合估计模型不确定性和数据不确定性，通过置信度评分筛选不可靠预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测需要预测训练数据中未见基因的扰动效果，预测可靠性取决于两个因素：目标基因与训练基因的相似性（模型不确定性）和训练数据质量（数据不确定性），这两种不确定性对确定预测可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出了PRESCRIBE框架，采用多变量深度证据回归方法，能够同时测量模型不确定性和数据不确定性两种来源的不确定性。

Result: PRESCRIBE能够有效估计每个预测的置信度评分，该评分与经验准确度强相关，在实验中相比可比基线实现了超过3%的稳定准确度提升。

Conclusion: PRESCRIBE通过联合估计两种不确定性来源，能够筛选不可靠预测结果，显著提高单细胞扰动预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统气候模型计算成本高昂，难以嵌入强化学习系统，限制了多气体动态下气候政策的大规模研究。

Method: 使用预训练的循环神经网络作为CICERO-SCM气候模型的代理模型，在MARL环境中直接集成，实现1000倍加速的推理速度。

Result: 代理模型达到接近模拟器的精度（温度RMSE≈0.0004K），端到端训练加速超过100倍，且与原始模拟器收敛到相同的最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了气候政策研究中的计算瓶颈，为多气体动态下的大规模多智能体气候政策实验提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异质性、节点数量、样本大小和通信拓扑等因素对非凸设置下泛化的影响。

Result: MGS以指数速率减少优化误差边界，但即使MGS趋于无穷大，与中心化mini-batch SGD相比仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距。在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能显著改善去中心化训练性能，但理论上无法完全消除与中心化训练的性能差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论分析框架。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

TL;DR: 该论文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法的安全漏洞：攻击者可以构建一个表面正常的模型，在剪枝后表现出恶意行为，成功率高达95.7%-99.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型剪枝已成为减少LLM推理内存占用的主要方法，但其安全影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全风险。

Method: 攻击者计算参数被剪枝可能性的代理指标，将恶意行为注入不易被剪枝的参数中，然后使用易被剪枝的参数修复模型，在未剪枝模型中抵消恶意行为。

Result: 在5个模型上的广泛评估显示，应用vLLM中的剪枝方法后，模型在多种攻击场景中表现出强烈的恶意行为：越狱成功率95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，定向内容注入成功率99.5%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型部署时的关键安全漏洞，强调了模型压缩中加强安全意识的紧迫性。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

Method: DUA-D2C方法在数据分区和独立训练的基础上，引入基于共享验证集性能和预测不确定性的动态加权聚合机制，让中心模型优先学习泛化能力更强、预测更自信的边缘模型。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上的实证评估表明，DUA-D2C显著改善了泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法之上应用也能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一个理论上有依据且有效的对抗现代深度学习中过拟合问题的方法，通过智能聚合机制更有效地利用子集模型的泛化能力差异。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使不使用参数置换，仅通过加宽模型和合适的softmax温度校准就能实现线性模式连接(LMC)。作者引入了层指数加权连接(LEWC)来解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数置换搜索和足够宽的模型，但本文旨在证明仅通过模型加宽和温度校准就能实现LMC。

Method: 使用softmax温度校准，分析中间层输出，提出层指数加权连接(LEWC)概念，表明合并模型的每层输出可以表示为原始模型对应层输出的指数加权和。

Result: 实验证明，即使没有参数置换，仅通过模型加宽和合适的温度校准就能实现LMC。LEWC解释表明合并模型输出相当于原始模型的集成。

Conclusion: 模型加宽不仅促进非线性模式连接，还显著增加了实现线性模式连接的可能性，这是首次证明加宽模型对LMC的积极作用。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分层预填充的新调度范式，将transformer层组作为主要调度单元，通过垂直分区模型并在层组间交错预填充和解码，在保持无停顿解码的同时消除分块导致的MoE权重重载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代服务系统采用分块预填充等无停顿调度技术，但在MoE模型中会产生显著的专家权重重载开销，增加内存流量和能耗。

Method: 将模型垂直分区为连续层组，在层组间交错预填充和解码操作，将调度轴从token维度转移到layer维度。

Result: 降低片外带宽需求，TTFT减少高达70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低高达22%，改善了TTFT-TBT帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 将调度轴从token转移到layer为共置环境中的高效、节能LLM服务开辟了新的操作机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受试者特定的分布偏移是EEG解码基础模型发展的主要障碍，需要开发能够适应个体差异的模型。

Method: 设计了一个自适应层作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的受试者不变组件和每个受试者独有的轻量级低秩修正。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅使用共享权重的模型和单独训练的受试者特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨受试者EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂学习智能体越来越多地与现有专家（如人类操作员或先前训练的智能体）一起部署，需要研究学习者如何最优地整合与自身经验结构不同的专家数据。

Method: 在贝叶斯多臂老虎机框架下研究：(i)离线设置：学习者在交互前接收专家最优策略的结果数据集；(ii)同步设置：学习者每一步选择基于自身经验还是专家同时获得的结果更新信念。提出了信息导向规则，让学习者处理能最大化关于最优行动一步信息增益的数据源。

Conclusion: 通过量化专家数据的价值，该框架为智能体提供了实用的、基于信息论的算法，使其能够智能地决定何时向他人学习。

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

TL;DR: 本文提出近似领域遗忘(ADU)新问题，旨在让预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)忘记特定领域(如插图)的识别能力，同时保持其他领域(如真实图像)的性能，解决了传统类别遗忘在实际应用中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似遗忘方法主要关注类别遗忘，但在实际应用中(如自动驾驶系统需要区分真实汽车和广告插画汽车)，仅遗忘类别信息不足，需要更细粒度的领域遗忘能力。

Method: 提出新方法，通过显式解耦领域分布并自适应捕捉实例特定的领域信息，解决预训练VLMs中领域分布高度纠缠的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在领域遗忘任务上优于基于VLM调优技术的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为VLMs中实用且细粒度的遗忘技术开辟了新途径，解决了领域分布纠缠带来的技术挑战。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节实现精确的熵控制，揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系，并扩展了RFT范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法存在熵崩溃问题，即熵单调下降导致探索消失和策略过早收敛。现有的熵正则化方法只能部分缓解这个问题，同时引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出AEPO方法，用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，通过温度调节稳定熵。包含三个关键设计：策略梯度作为正则化、分布作为正则化、REINFORCE作为正则化。

Result: AEPO能够在任意目标水平稳定熵，有效消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系；提供了更广泛的RFT范式，其中优越的目标分布可以作为REINFORCE正则化器。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵控制问题，阐明了熵、探索和推理之间的联系，并为RFT提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

Motivation: 利用高级推理模型中出现的置信度校准特性，通过早期停止来节省计算资源并减少延迟。

Method: 使用token级logprobs的香农熵作为置信信号，通过少量示例计算模型特定的熵阈值来实现早期停止。

Result: 在推理优化模型系列中实现25-50%计算成本降低，同时保持准确性，表明置信机制是现代后训练推理系统的显著特征。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型在早期就能知道正确答案，这种出现的置信意识可以被利用来节省token和减少延迟，置信机制是区分现代推理系统与前代模型的关键特征。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

Motivation: 解决现有分布式无监督多源域自适应方法在源域数量增加时计算开销大、性能不稳定的问题，特别是在异构域多样性高的场景下。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进结果，在多样多源设置中显著优于先前方法，特别是在其他方法无法收敛的情况下。

Conclusion: GALA框架能够有效处理大规模异构源域的域自适应问题，提供稳定且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，偏斜的类别分布阻碍模型对尾部类别的泛化能力

Method: 引入低秩参数组件来调节参数空间分配，采用定制损失和正弦重加权调度，不增加整体模型复杂度

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试中，MORE显著提高了泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有的不平衡缓解方法

Conclusion: MORE作为长尾设置中的稳健即插即用模块具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集经常同时面临类别不平衡和标签噪声的挑战，现有方法单独处理这些问题时容易产生冲突。本文发现类别不平衡（分布层面）和标签噪声（样本层面）在不同粒度上运作，它们的鲁棒机制可以互补而不冲突。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

TL;DR: EVOR是一种可扩展的离线强化学习方法，通过结合表达性策略和价值函数，避免了蒸馏或反向传播时间的问题，在训练时通过流匹配学习最优正则化Q函数，在推理时通过拒绝采样进行策略提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习虽然避免了在线交互的高成本，但在扩展到复杂数据集时需要表达性生成模型。现有方法依赖计算昂贵的反向传播时间或引入复合误差的策略蒸馏，限制了可扩展性。

Method: EVOR在训练时通过流匹配学习最优正则化Q函数，在推理时通过拒绝采样对表达性价值函数进行策略提取，实现高效优化、正则化和计算可扩展搜索。

Result: 实验表明EVOR在多种离线RL任务上优于基线方法，证明了将表达性价值学习整合到离线RL中的益处。

Conclusion: EVOR提供了一种无需蒸馏或BPTT的可扩展离线RL方法，通过表达性价值函数和策略的有效整合，在保持计算效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PSCBMs方法，通过添加小型协方差预测模块，为预训练的概念瓶颈模型引入概念间的多元正态分布，无需重新训练主干模型，提高了干预性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖关系的方法需要重新训练整个模型，这在原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 在预训练CBM基础上添加协方差预测模块，构建概念间的多元正态分布，提出两种训练策略。

Result: PSCBMs在测试时概念和目标准确率与标准CBM相当或更好，在干预情况下性能显著优于CBM，且比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能有效建模概念依赖关系，提升干预性能，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP），结合贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和CVaR约束规划，在波动环境中实现更安全的顺序决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望收益是不够的，需要系统性的不确定性管理方法。

Method: UAMDP框架将贝叶斯预测、Thompson采样和条件风险价值（CVaR）约束规划相结合，形成闭环决策系统。

Result: 在高频股票交易和零售库存控制两个领域，UAMDP相比深度学习基线显著提升预测精度（RMSE降低25%，sMAPE降低32%），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、基于后验不确定性的探索和风险感知控制，能够实现更稳健、可泛化的顺序决策方法，获得更安全和更盈利的结果。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO方法，一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过分布匹配提升推理能力，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)是自回归大语言模型(AR-LLMs)的有前景替代方案，具有更高的推理吞吐量潜力。但需要专门的强化学习算法来使其在推理等关键任务上达到与AR-LLMs相当的性能。

Method: 提出了分布匹配策略优化(DMPO)，通过交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优的奖励倾斜分布进行匹配。针对小批量训练挑战，提出了新颖的权重基线减法技术。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现出色，无需监督微调即可实现高达42.9%的准确率提升（相比之前SOTA基线）和55.8%的准确率提升（相比基础模型）。

Conclusion: 分布匹配框架在提升dLLMs推理能力方面非常有效，DMPO方法为dLLMs的强化学习微调提供了理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

TL;DR: 该研究使用政治罗盘测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都存在一致的左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 采用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型固有政治倾向，使用角色提示探索显性刻板印象，并通过多语言版本测试揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有被调查模型都显示出一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见存在一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

TL;DR: 首次研究LLM智能体中的对手塑造能力，提出ShapeLLM方法，证明LLM智能体能够通过互动影响其他智能体的学习动态，在竞争性游戏中引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏中促进协调并提高集体福利。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实环境中的部署增加，多智能体交互变得不可避免，需要理解这些系统中的策略行为。核心问题是LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互来塑造学习动态并影响其他智能体的行为。

Method: 提出ShapeLLM方法，这是为基于transformer的智能体量身定制的无模型对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏（迭代囚徒困境、匹配硬币和胆小鬼游戏）中成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏（迭代猎鹿游戏和合作版囚徒困境）中促进协调并提高集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过互动相互塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务设置中的表达能力以及对异构或多样化偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入基于专家分配的潜变量模型，优化变分证据下界，支持共享基础架构和独立专家模型，实现参数效率与专业化的灵活权衡。

Result: 在各种模型大小和多偏好数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了Mix-和MoE-DPO作为偏好对齐的强大可扩展方法。

Conclusion: Mix-和MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了比标准DPO更强大和可扩展的方法，具有通用函数逼近、奖励策略专业化和上下文对齐三大优势。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文解决了高维多元结果的反事实识别问题，使用连续时间流方法在标准准则下建立识别基础，确保反事实推断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实推断方法缺乏识别性，削弱了因果估计的有效性。Pearl认为反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张，因此需要建立可靠的反事实识别基础。

Method: 使用连续时间流匹配方法，结合动态最优传输工具，构建唯一、单调且保持秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了反事实公理合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 提出的连续时间流方法为高维多元结果的反事实识别提供了理论基础，确保了反事实推断的因果有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性，需要将物理定律的固有层次结构直接嵌入到深度生成模型中。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子(FNOs)学习物理算子和条件流匹配(CFM)进行概率生成，通过时间相关的分层约束和FNO引导的修正进行集成。

Result: 在谐振子、人类活动识别和锂离子电池退化等实验中，相比基线方法生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将物理信息归纳偏置引入生成模型，显著提升了时间序列生成的物理一致性和预测性能。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

Motivation: 6G网络中AI模型需要适应持续变化的环境，包括新特征引入、硬件升级和服务需求演进，需要灵活的机器学习方法来应对非平稳环境。

Method: 使用自适应随机森林(ARFs)进行动态特征适应，并提出漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)方法，利用分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集的特征重要性方法。

Result: 在3个不同数据集上的测试表明，该方法可将运行时间减少最多2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值，ARFs的预测准确率随时间推移而提高。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同提供了一个有前景的框架，用于构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

Motivation: 解决分布式机器学习中的对抗行为问题，现有方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么通信成本过高。

Result: 在对抗性环境中保持鲁棒性，准确性与全连接通信相当，在大规模网络中高效扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的分布式鲁棒学习方案，显著降低通信成本而不影响收敛保证。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

Motivation: 传统LtD方法将人类和机器学习模型视为互斥决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测结果，需要更灵活的人类-AI协作框架。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：标准ML模型和带有额外专家反馈的增强模型，提供顺序训练和联合训练两种实现方式，后者设计了具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为有效的人类-AI协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架通过同时处理何时以及如何整合专家输入，超越了传统LtD方法，实现了更有效的人类-AI协作。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

Method: 理论分析单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，证明平衡logit位移在短序列上的表现可以泛化到长序列。通过机制分析识别softmax压缩和训练噪声问题，提出使用dropout和EMA来改善泛化。在集合补集任务和OthelloGPT上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了单层注意力Transformer的维度边界，发现平衡logit位移在短序列上的表现可以泛化到长序列，但精度会降低。实验验证了dropout和EMA可以改善泛化性能，在OthelloGPT上也观察到EMA的提升效果。

Conclusion: Transformer在集合补集任务中存在长度泛化能力，但受到softmax压缩和训练噪声的限制。dropout和EMA是改善泛化性能的有效方法，为理解Transformer的泛化机制提供了理论见解。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于数据的安全个性化肠内营养治疗有潜力超越传统指南或启发式方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the

TL;DR: 提出一种新的采样算法，通过轻量级微调单个层，显著提升预训练掩码扩散模型的样本质量和效率，特别在低步数生成场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练掩码扩散模型的性能受限于其采样过程，该过程决策不可逆且在低步数生成时表现不佳。

Method: 采用星形生成范式，结合可学习的重掩码调度器，智能识别和修正可能错误，实现错误校正。

Result: 在文本和代码生成任务中，该采样算法优于或匹配现有方法，特别是在小步数采样时带来显著质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了掩码扩散模型采样过程中的不可逆决策问题，为低步数高效生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

TL;DR: 评估四种对比学习框架在边缘/雾计算环境中的资源消耗表现，发现SimCLR在能耗方面表现最佳，并提出了轻量化神经网络架构的扩展分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习在自监督表征学习中很有前景，但在资源受限设备上的部署研究不足，面临能耗、数据可用性和内存使用等挑战。

Method: 系统评估SimCLR、MoCo、SimSiam和Barlow Twins四种对比学习框架，采用包含能耗分析和减少训练数据条件的基准测试策略。

Result: SimCLR在各种数据条件下表现出最低的能耗，与其感知的计算成本相反。轻量化神经网络架构与对比学习框架结合也进行了评估。

Conclusion: 为在边缘/雾环境中部署对比学习提供了资源影响的见解，并为其未来优化开辟了多个研究方向。

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Conclusion: 广义Natarajan维度成功地表征了可原谅0-1损失函数在有限标签多类设置中的学习性，为集合值反馈学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种基于果蝇嗅觉电路启发的LoRA变体，通过隐式混合专家和随机投影矩阵解决参数干扰问题，在多个领域实现性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，导致性能不佳。虽然基于MoE的LoRA变体在单任务中有所改善，但在多任务模型合并中仍然存在任务间干扰，且需要额外路由参数

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1) 在上投影矩阵中引入按秩的专家激活；2) 使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和下投影，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统可训练密集版本

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验显示，相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅提供了实证性能增益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，消除了显式路由器的需求并缓解了任务间干扰

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文测试了多种深度学习超分辨率模型，用于提高牙本质孔隙网络成像的效率和质量，发现传统图像质量评估指标与视觉感知不一致，提出基于生物学特征的分析方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前牙本质孔隙成像受限于共聚焦显微镜的高分辨率要求，导致视野范围小。需要开发方法在保持图像质量的同时提高采集效率。

Method: 使用四种深度学习超分辨率模型（RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN、CycleGAN）处理配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像，进行2×、4×、8×超分辨率重建，并通过基于孔隙网络结构的生物学驱动评估方法分析性能。

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，而基于孔隙连通性和形态学的生物学评估能更好解释模型性能差异，揭示了模型对弱强度特征的敏感性和图像生成非线性的影响。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物学结构的定制化评估方法比通用图像质量指标更适合评估超分辨率模型在牙本质孔隙成像中的表现。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出基于困惑度正则化的提示优化方法，通过数据依赖的困惑度作为有效先验，在数据稀缺情况下改善提示泛化性能，并推导出非空泛的理论边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程方法在实践中成功，但理论分析仅在数据丰富时有效。作者认为困惑度作为自然语言先验可以更好地解释提示优化的广泛成功。

Method: 使用困惑度正则化限制提示搜索空间，推导基于更实用先验的泛化边界，形式化分析困惑度正则化如何通过限制探索来收紧边界。

Result: 理论推导出在数据稀缺情况下非空泛的泛化边界，实证验证了边界的有效性以及困惑度正则化在改善提示泛化方面的实际好处。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为数据依赖先验能有效指导提示优化，在数据稀缺情况下提供理论保证和实际性能提升。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DGPO算法，直接利用组级偏好信息进行强化学习，无需依赖低效的随机策略，可使用高效的确定性ODE采样器，训练速度提升20倍且性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如GRPO难以适应扩散模型，因为GRPO需要随机策略，而最有效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE。现有解决方案使用SDE采样器引入随机性，但依赖模型无关的高斯噪声导致收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出DGPO算法，完全摒弃策略梯度框架，直接从组级偏好中学习，利用组内样本的相对信息。这种设计消除了对低效随机策略的需求，可以使用高效的确定性ODE采样器和更快的训练。

Result: 实验结果显示DGPO比现有最先进方法训练速度快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均取得更优性能。

Conclusion: DGPO通过直接学习组级偏好，解决了扩散模型中强化学习效率低下的问题，实现了显著的速度提升和性能改进。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高风险表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程，从法律和承保语料库中检索条款，嵌入到智能体观察中，用于约束可行行动并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多智能体条约模拟器中，ClauseLens将偿付能力违规减少51%，尾部风险表现提高27.9%，基于条款的解释准确率达到88.2%，检索精度87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可以产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，与Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案一致。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，通过强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间实现平衡，无需手动设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：高端模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态路由规则和关键词启发式方法无法充分利用这一频谱且难以适应不同任务类型。

Method: 使用基于工具调用的路由系统，通过端到端的强化学习训练路由器，采用明确的成本感知奖励函数来编码成本-性能权衡，无需手动设计路由规则。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了强大的成本-性能权衡（例如在保持相似任务完成率的情况下显著降低成本），并提供了关于学习路由有效性的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，其发现和开源实现有助于该领域的发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Result: SymTime在五大时间序列分析任务中表现出色，性能可与在真实数据集上预训练的基础模型相媲美

Conclusion: 系列-符号数据生成和预训练机制在克服数据稀缺和提升任务性能方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

Motivation: GNN通过消息传递机制在节点间传输信息，但存在过压缩问题，即来自大感受野的节点表示信息被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。本文旨在重新审视这一问题。

Method: 通过定义节点表示的存储和检索容量，研究现有测量任务的局限性，开发新的合成任务来验证信息瓶颈。借鉴序列建模中的关联记忆、快速权重编程器和xLSTM模型思想，开发具有改进容量的新型GNN架构。

Conclusion: 从存储和检索容量的角度分析过压缩问题，并开发了具有改进容量的新型GNN架构，在合成任务和真实基准测试中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多基于启发式方法，缺乏严格的分类框架来指导激活函数的选择和设计。

Method: 使用九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)，包括高斯传播统计(m1, g1, g2, m2, eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus, alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'), C(phi))。

Result: 对八种标准激活函数进行了分类，证明了饱和、线性增长和平滑族之间的明显区别，数值验证确认了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，从试错方法转向可证明的稳定性和核条件化。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法确定性回归到多个标注者的平均帧分数，忽略了任务固有的主观性，无法反映不同人类对好摘要的不同偏好。

Method: 采用扩散模型，将视频摘要作为条件生成任务，使模型能够学习好摘要的分布，并根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要更贴近个体标注者偏好，并通过背包问题分析提供了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要重新定义为条件生成任务，使用扩散模型能够更好地处理任务的主观性，生成多样化的高质量摘要。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉复杂关系。LLMs的注意力机制为聚类提供了新的可能性，特别是在处理多样分布数据时。

Method: 使用LLMs的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，通过零样本学习和微调（使用Next Token Prediction损失）提升聚类能力，支持文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLMs在文本编码数值数据上展现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示明显的聚类模式。谱聚类使用注意力矩阵提供了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLMs在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性，为传统聚类方法提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统多模态学习依赖配对数据集，但能否利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表征学习是一个被忽视但具有潜力的问题。

Method: 提出UML（Unpaired Multimodal Learner），采用模态无关的训练范式，单个模型交替处理不同模态输入并共享参数，利用不同模态是共享底层现实投影的假设。

target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

TL;DR: DYNAMIX是一个基于强化学习的批量大小优化框架，使用PPO算法将批量大小选择建模为序列决策问题，在异构动态计算环境中实现自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习批量大小选择方法采用静态分配或简单启发式策略，无法适应异构动态计算环境的需求。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，采用包含网络指标、系统资源利用率和训练统计效率指标的多维状态表示，基于PPO算法进行批量大小优化决策。

Result: 在多样化工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，DYNAMIX实现了最终模型准确率提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%。在32节点集群规模下保持最佳性能，学习策略能有效跨模型架构泛化。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX无需显式系统建模即可无缝集成到现有分布式训练框架中，在异构动态环境中显著提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法只关注期望回报，难以描述学习到的策略特性。需要一种能保证收敛到特定最优策略并保持策略多样性的方法。

Method: 使用熵正则化和温度解耦策略，在正则化温度趋近于零时实现可解释、保持多样性的最优策略。其中一个实例中，策略会均匀采样所有最优动作。

Result: 提出的方法能保证收敛到特定最优策略，并确保策略衍生对象（价值函数和回报分布）的收敛性。算法能以任意精度估计与可解释、多样性保持最优策略相关的回报分布。

Conclusion: 该框架为策略优化提供了理论保证，实现了可解释且保持多样性的最优策略，解决了传统RL方法在策略特性描述方面的不足。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

*Joe Suk,Yaqi Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为RLVR（使用可验证奖励的强化学习）建立了理论框架，通过分析梯度间隙和步长阈值来解释其收敛性，并验证了长度归一化等实践启发式方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR使用简单的二元反馈来后训练大语言模型，在实践中取得了显著成功，但缺乏对其工作原理的理论理解。

Method: 在完整响应（轨迹）和标记级别分析RLVR训练过程，引入梯度间隙概念来形式化从低奖励到高奖励区域的改进方向，推导基于梯度间隙大小的步长阈值。

Result: 证明收敛性取决于更新方向与梯度间隙的对齐，推导出临界步长阈值：低于该阈值学习收敛，高于则性能崩溃。理论预测临界步长必须随响应长度和成功率缩放。

Conclusion: 理论解释了长度归一化等实践启发式方法改善稳定性的原因，并表明固定学习率下成功率可能停滞在100%以下。通过受控老虎机模拟和LLM实验验证了这些预测。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在采样过程中缺乏有效的熵控制机制，导致性能受限。需要一种简单有效的方法来约束采样熵，提升模型在各种任务中的表现。

Method: 设计特殊的激活函数应用于模型输出，约束采样熵不低于给定阈值，实现熵控制。

Abstract: We propose ERA, a new paradigm that constrains the sampling entropy above
given thresholds by applying specially designed activations to the outputs of
models. Our approach demonstrates broad effectiveness across different domains:
1) for large language models(LLMs), boosting the AIME 2025 score for
Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 37.4%; 2) for continuous control reinforcement learning
agents, improving performance by more than 30% over strong baselines such as
SAC on the challenging HumanoidBench; 3) for image classification, enhancing
ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 0.69% for ResNet-50. These gains are achieved with a
computational overhead of less than 7%. Our work validates output activation as
a powerful tool for entropy control, opening a new direction for designing
simpler and more robust algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但难以进行强化学习微调，因为现有方法要么存在严重偏差，要么计算成本过高。

Method: 重新审视ELBO估计，分解方差来源，提出GDPO算法，利用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案减少方差，提供可证明的低方差估计器。

Conclusion: GDPO为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了有效解决方案，通过降低方差实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过将线性算子夹在两个可逆神经网络之间，使得非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络本质上是非线性的，但线性性是相对于向量空间对定义的。本文旨在找到非标准向量空间，使得传统非线性函数在其中表现为线性。

Method: 提出Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中A是线性算子，g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络。通过新定义的加法和缩放操作诱导出向量空间。

Result: 该框架使得SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具可应用于非线性映射。两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍是Linearizer，可将扩散模型的数百个采样步骤压缩为单步。

Conclusion: Linearizer框架成功将线性代数工具扩展到非线性映射，在扩散模型、投影生成模型和模块化风格迁移中展示了应用价值。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.
