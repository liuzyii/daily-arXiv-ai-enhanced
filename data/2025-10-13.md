*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，匹配或超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多模态大语言模型进行视觉理解任务，特别是在数据有限的情况下，研究LLM的适应性和数据效率。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）上的微调效果。

Result: LLM经过微调后性能提升高达36%，能够匹配或超越需要大量数据的CNN基线方法，展示了LLM在数据效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在低资源视觉环境中具有出色的适应性和数据效率，为跨模态学习提供了新的见解，代码已开源以促进后续研究。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02851)
*Zhibin Liu,Haoye Dong,Aviral Chharia,Hefeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Human-VDM方法，使用视频扩散模型从单张RGB图像生成高质量3D人体，通过高斯泼溅技术解决多视角不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用多视角扩散模型生成3D人体时存在视角不一致问题，影响生成质量。需要准确建模几何、高质量纹理和合理不可见部分。

Method: 包含三个模块：视角一致的人体视频扩散模块、视频增强模块和高斯泼溅模块。首先生成连贯人体视频，然后进行超分辨率和视频插值增强，最后学习逼真3D人体。

Result: 实验表明Human-VDM在生成质量和数量上均优于现有最先进方法，能够从单张图像生成高质量3D人体。

Conclusion: Human-VDM通过视频扩散模型和高斯泼溅技术有效解决了视角一致性问题，实现了高质量的3D人体生成。

Abstract: Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging
task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry,
high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically
use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face
inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To
address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from
a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally
consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists
of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video
augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is
fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video.
Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video
interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated
video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans
under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images.
Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a
single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality
and quantity. Project page: https://human-vdm.github.io/Human-VDM/

### [4] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过调整初始噪声样本来减少文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化问题，在保持图像-文本对齐的同时促进更早的吸引盆逃逸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型存在记忆和复制训练数据的问题，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)会导致生成图像与提示对齐不佳，需要促进更早的吸引盆逃逸。

Method: 提出两种缓解策略：通过集体或个体方式调整初始噪声，找到能促进更早吸引盆逃逸的初始样本，从而可以更早应用CFG。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定吸引盆逃逸时间中起关键作用，通过调整初始噪声可以有效地减少扩散模型的记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [5] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种AI图像生成工具在职业图像生成中的代表性偏见，发现两者都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在可视化创作方面提供了巨大机会，但现有研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。随着AI图像工具日益普及，解决有害的性别偏见对于确保媒体和职业环境中的多样性表征至关重要。

Method: 研究通过生成超过750张职业相关的AI图像，使用主题分析方法评估DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种工具在性别表征方面的偏见。

Result: 分析结果显示，DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度有所不同。AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要解决AI图像生成中的性别偏见问题，并为从业者、个人和研究人员提出了增加可见性别图像生成中代表性的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [6] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉自回归模型(VAR)中引入动态专家混合路由机制，通过尺度感知阈值策略减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在不同分辨率下重复调用Transformer导致计算冗余，需要更高效的架构来平衡计算成本和生成质量。

Method: 集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略，根据token复杂度和分辨率动态选择专家，无需额外训练。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，推理速度提升11%，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 提出的动态专家混合路由机制有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与生成质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [7] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中有效检测未知物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但会混淆认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能够准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比现有基于不确定性的方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（降低36%）。

Conclusion: 基于层次贝叶斯建模的认知不确定性方法能够有效分离不确定性类型，显著提升无监督OOD检测性能，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [8] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种分层开放集活动识别分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在无法逾越的差距：生活中执行的活动范围与训练数据集中标注的活动范围之间存在巨大差异。未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱HAR分类器的可靠性。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，不仅支持开放集分类，还能将未知类定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 能够以最先进准确率识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，提供超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅实现了开放集分类，还收集了新的NFI_FARED数据集，为未来开放集HAR研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [9] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡(HFOs)自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分HFOs、尖波、背景活动和伪影，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的敏感性和98.57%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别HFOs耗时、费力且主观，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用时频域S变换提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分HFOs与尖波、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感性97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的HFOs比率与手术结果相关性更强(0.73)。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫患者癫痫发生的可靠生物标志物，切除HFOs（特别是快速波纹）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留HFOs会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了DINOv2视觉Transformer的内部表示机制，发现其概念表示超越了线性稀疏假设，提出了基于凸混合原型的概念空间组织方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部表示机制仍不明确。研究旨在理解DINOv2如何表示视觉概念，并验证线性表示假设的适用性。

Method: 采用线性表示假设(LRH)并通过稀疏自编码器(SAE)学习32,000个单元的字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究SAE学习概念的几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现功能专业化现象：分类任务利用"Elsewhere"概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单眼深度线索。概念表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有局部连接的低维结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假设(MRH)，认为token是通过原型凸混合形成的，这种结构基于Gardenfors概念空间理论，为理解视觉Transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光照），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以有效处理遥感图像采集过程中的复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器(RMP)和频率感知退化分解器(FADD)进行退化特征分析，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四种修复任务中均取得最优性能，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度，实现性能与效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: PhyDAE通过显式建模退化物理和自适应专家策略，有效解决了遥感图像多退化修复问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，结合语言回归和扩散生成技术，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。本文旨在开发一个统一的模型来弥合这一差距，实现跨视角的空间智能任务。

Method: 提出'将相机视为语言'的新范式，训练在Puffin-4M数据集上，包含400万视觉-语言-相机三元组，结合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验显示Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，通过指令调优可泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视图任务。

Conclusion: Puffin为多模态空间智能研究提供了统一的解决方案，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

TL;DR: 提出结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学图像分类任务中实现竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结预训练网络权重并添加任务特定层的方法限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据极少时仍容易过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结网络内部结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，仅需最少额外参数即可针对特定数据定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学图像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比已有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个评估多模态大语言模型在具身能力方面的综合基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本任务。评估发现现有MLLM在具身能力方面存在持续局限性，为此提出了BEAR-Agent代理来增强感知、3D理解和规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本任务，涵盖从低级指向、轨迹理解到高级规划的能力。并开发BEAR-Agent代理，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLM的广泛评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性。BEAR-Agent显著提升了MLLM在BEAR上的表现，实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 改进MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为全面评估具身能力提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生物视觉机制（中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多视角图像，在分类前重建图像以消除对抗噪声，无需重新训练下游分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法依赖计算密集的优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性。研究假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码在其中起关键作用。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导眼跳选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周视角，整合成重建图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对各种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练或微调下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，首次系统性解决了线性注意力在超分辨率中的训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡问题，实现了高效且高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度，计算开销大。线性注意力虽然提供线性复杂度解决方案，但历史上存在训练不稳定、感知-失真权衡等未解决的挑战。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用基于SNR的专家混合架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 建立轻量级TAG指导范式，遵循"精度优于数量"原则。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式的高效识别技术来改进种群监测。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中达到了高准确率，为在更具挑战性的环境中使用媒体数据进行研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法开发。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个基于智能路由的通用视频质量评估框架，通过多层级专家模型路由系统，利用视觉-语言模型动态选择最适合的专家模型来解决传统VQA模型的泛化性差、可解释性不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在直接分数监督训练下存在三个主要问题：(1) 对不同内容类型（用户生成内容、短视频、AI生成内容）泛化能力差；(2) 可解释性有限；(3) 缺乏对新用例或内容类型的可扩展性。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多样化专家模型，使用视觉-语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在基于质量的问题回答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router展示了作为下一代VQA系统基础的潜力，能够结合专业专家的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中提供一致性能，并有望作为视频生成模型后训练阶段的奖励函数。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐、硬负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，缺乏统一解决方案，且可能引入无关信息

Method: 1) 多层次多模态对齐的统一解决方案；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇表作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最优方法

Conclusion: 提出的三重贡献框架有效解决了Med-VQA中的关键挑战，为医学视觉问答任务提供了更强大的解决方案

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在视频生成和修复中很关键，但计算成本高且速度慢，限制了在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理视频区域，在保持感知质量的同时显著加速了视频超分辨率处理，为高分辨率和长视频应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临两个主要挑战：感知瓶颈（处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入）和token过载（超出图像模型处理能力）。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重构为子问题）两种策略。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe在多个基准测试中有效提升了视频理解能力，特别是在处理长视频的挑战性基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架能够有效处理复杂的视频-语言任务，展示了在视频理解领域的潜力。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像并使用视觉语言模型分类，但存在2D遮挡噪声和推理速度慢的问题

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，解决了作物生长监测中标注成本高和模型可解释性差的问题。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量的方法，能够同时表达概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊑哺乳动物⊑动物）和跨概念族的组合结构（如"汽车里的狗"⊑狗,汽车）。双曲空间虽然能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其表示组合性的能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上采用ℓ₁-乘积度量。概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中体现，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积结构成功解决了同时表示层次性和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新的迁移攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，从而提高对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分割模型在白盒设置下对对抗样本具有显著脆弱性，但现有攻击方法在不同分割模型间的迁移性较差。分割模型中的复杂上下文依赖关系以及代理模型与目标模型之间的特征分布差距导致迁移成功率不理想。

Method: 提出SegTrans框架，将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射其语义信息以生成多样化的增强样本。这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留原始输入的局部语义信息而非全局语义信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种不同分割模型和三种骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，且不引入额外计算开销。与当前最先进方法相比，平均迁移攻击成功率提高8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息重映射有效解决了分割模型对抗攻击的迁移性问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了攻击成功率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ASVP方法，针对图像恢复模型的知识蒸馏攻击进行防御，通过在内部特征图中使用奇异值分解注入结构化高频扰动，有效破坏学生模型的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击严重威胁深度模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以扩展到图像恢复任务，因为恢复任务是生成式任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保留。

Method: ASVP方法在教师模型的内部特征图上使用奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在五种图像恢复任务上评估，ASVP使学生模型的PSNR降低高达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，而对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: 提出了Ro-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态分布外反事实视频上的鲁棒性，发现现有模型性能显著下降，但通过反事实数据微调可大幅提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 创建Ro-Bench基准，通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合来生成高质量、多样且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估8个最新视频MLLM模型。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著性能下降，但使用反事实数据微调MLLM可提升鲁棒性，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench的20个任务上提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLM的视频理解能力，强调了评估和改进模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 现代农业监测系统依赖多源数据，但无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，包括动物小、遮挡、部分可见等场景特定问题。迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大型数据集而效果有限。

Method: 开发了对象聚焦的数据增强框架，通过分割动物与背景，结合变换和基于扩散的合成技术，生成真实多样的场景，专门针对动物健康监测的数据约束环境。

Result: 初步实验表明，使用增强数据集在动物检测任务上表现优于基线模型，证明该方法能有效提升检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过生成领域特定数据，该方法能够在数据稀缺场景下实现实时动物健康监测，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过增强token感知和分解复杂感知问题，显著提升大型视觉语言模型的视觉感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时缩放技术在视觉感知任务中效果有限，因为当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对底层感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS将DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过增加感知相关token和提升对图像token的关注度，有效解决了LVLMs在视觉感知任务中的精度限制问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，从而提高可解释性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，这种对先验的过度依赖会降低下游任务（如手势和活动识别）的性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加额外的关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测的可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置中超过115,000个信号帧的评估显示，mmJoints描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模姿态估计中的偏差，提高了可解释性和下游任务性能，为毫米波姿态估计提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法准确率有限，现有多向量检索方法仍存在准确率和效率不足的问题，忽视了查询与不同图像对象的对齐以及冗余的细粒度图像分割

Method: 1) 引入分层范式，使用多个中间粒度来处理不同图像对象以增强对齐；2) 利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性最小化冗余检索；3) 为每个数据集自动配置参数

Result: HiMIR不仅显著提高了准确性，而且相比现有MVR系统减少了高达3.5倍的计算量

Conclusion: HiMIR框架通过分层设计和冗余优化，有效解决了图像检索中的准确性和效率问题，适用于多样化场景

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）的细节生成上仍存在结构扭曲和不真实纹理的问题，而手部区域质量评估被忽视，限制了相关下游任务的性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（包含48k高质量和低质量手部图像对），开发基于多模态大语言模型和手部关键点先验知识的HandEval质量评估模型，并构建人工标注测试集进行验证。

Result: HandEval在质量评估上与人类判断的一致性优于现有最先进方法，在图像生成和AIGC检测应用中显著提升了生成手部真实感和检测准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了生成手部质量评估的空白，提出的HandEval模型在下游应用中具有普遍有效性，为提升文本到图像模型的手部生成质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI着色技术虽然能生成逼真的彩色图像，但存在未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售的版权侵权风险，目前缺乏有效的防御方法。

Method: 提出Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可感知的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的首个防御范式，为生成媒体中的版权保护防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序的token-by-token解码过程，推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传播才能生成单张图像。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，使用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能通过减少模型前向传播次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归模型推理效率低的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了大视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器来抑制不确定视觉标记的影响，是缓解物体幻觉的有效策略

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略能够同时改善自回归图像生成的质量和效率，为AR图像生成提供了有效的采样优化方案。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化问题，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，通过强分支和弱分支实现特征一致性，在三个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常存在噪声，这些噪声在领域转移下会被放大，威胁系统可靠性。虽然图像中的噪声标签学习已有研究，但在3D LiDAR分割领域泛化中的应用仍未被探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为带噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Result: 在817名急性缺血性卒中患者数据集上评估，该方法在从CT灌注扫描合成DWI和ADC图像时，提升了整体图像质量和病灶轮廓精度，优于现有图像转换模型。

Conclusion: 该后训练策略易于适配预训练模型，在多种医学图像转换任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过多模态知识训练单模态3D-CNN的方法，用于动态手势识别，通过特征对齐和正则化避免负迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，但本文旨在将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升。

Method: 为每个模态分配独立网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)对齐不同网络的特征内容，并使用焦点正则化参数避免负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功地将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，实现了性能提升，为动态手势识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不够充分。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过改进的局部几何建模能力，显著提升了点云法向量估计的性能。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了小目标检测和轨迹连续性等关键问题。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将密集的Diffusion Transformer转换为混合专家结构，通过激活更少的参数来减少推理开销，同时保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformer参数规模大导致推理开销高，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，并提出混合块选择性激活机制，采用多步蒸馏流程进行优化

Result: 在FLUX.1等大型扩散Transformer上，激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，优于剪枝方法

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个基于对象中心组合策略的简单可扩展数据合成流水线，通过在图像中粘贴高质量合成对象片段，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组任务需要大量标注数据，但真实数据标注成本高、存在偏差且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 采用对象中心组合策略，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，结合结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力，增强LVIS和COCO数据集可带来跨真实数据尺度的强大性能，在极有限真实数据下增益更大。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Motivation: 计算病理学中标注数据稀缺，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态的细胞，手动标注成本高昂，需要一种成本效益高的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型，通过细胞核形态图（水平和垂直图）、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测指标元数据来条件化生成过程，通过多头交叉注意力整合异构模态。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入具有低Wasserstein距离。合成样本显著提高了柱状细胞分割模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略能有效提高细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性障碍，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法（如Zernike和伪Zernike矩）存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性的问题，特别是在大阶数时。这些方法需要耦合的径向-角度处理，无法进行高效分解。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角度基，实现完全核分解，使径向和角度处理独立。这种可分离设计将计算复杂度降至O(N² log N)，内存需求降至O(N²)。

Result: PSepT表现出正交性、完备性、能量守恒和旋转协变性。实验结果显示更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和在结构化数据集上的竞争性分类性能，同时保持精确重建。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得以前用经典方法不可行的高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责性。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或影响训练样本，作者认为这两种视角应该联合研究。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因能提供细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法无法暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法为深度模型提供了新的解释视角，能够揭示传统方法无法发现的模型内部工作机制。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Motivation: 当前支气管镜导航技术依赖患者CT扫描和额外传感器，需要额外设置、扫描和培训。准确的度量定位并非总是必要，拓扑定位通常足以辅助外科医生导航。

Method: 开发了基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅使用模型数据进行训练，无需真实患者CT扫描，避免了高昂的真实数据标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的图像基支气管镜拓扑定位方法为支气管镜手术提供了有效的导航辅助，无需患者特定CT扫描，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，这种细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了ILR在现实世界中的跨领域应用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化对象实例，在不同条件和背景下形成大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像，然后对基础视觉模型进行微调。

Result: 在七个跨多个领域的ILR基准测试中，该方法显著提高了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模数据收集和整理提供了高效有效的替代方案，引入了一种新的ILR范式，仅需目标领域名称作为输入，为现实世界应用开辟了广阔前景。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知mAP上均取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: TARO框架成功地将未知物体分类到语义层次中的粗粒度类别，为安全关键应用提供了更细粒度的未知物体信息。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim Küchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，解决了VDA只能批处理的问题，在精度和VRAM使用上优于现有在线方法，并在边缘设备上实现实时运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Depth Anything (VDA) 在长视频序列中表现出色，但依赖批处理，无法用于在线场景。需要开发能够在在线设置中工作的视频深度估计方法。

Method: 采用大型语言模型(LLM)的技术：在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时对帧进行掩码处理，实现在线视频深度估计。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上都优于所有竞争在线视频深度估计方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功实现了高效的在线视频深度估计，特别适合在低功耗硬件上部署，将发布代码和编译脚本以促进实际应用。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的驾驶员意图预测框架VCBM，通过DAAD-X数据集提供层次化文本解释，无需后处理技术就能生成时空一致的解释，并证明基于transformer的模型比CNN更具可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。需要理解环境表示和驾驶任务的底层表示，这在基于深度学习的系统中仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 提出了Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，能够无需后处理技术就生成时空一致的解释。使用了基于驾驶员眼动和自车视角的多模态数据集DAAD-X，提供层次化高层文本解释作为驾驶员决策的因果推理。

Result: 在DAAD-X数据集上的广泛评估表明，基于transformer的模型比传统CNN模型表现出更好的可解释性。还引入了多标签t-SNE可视化技术来展示多个解释之间的解缠和因果相关性。

Conclusion: VCBM框架为驾驶员意图预测提供了有效的可解释性解决方案，transformer架构在可解释性方面优于CNN，多模态数据和层次化解释有助于理解驾驶决策过程。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP模型的多模态深度学习框架，通过语义线索改进牛只行为识别性能，在监督学习下达到96.1%的准确率，并在少样本场景中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和福祉的重要指标。现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务上表现不足，需要开发能够利用有限数据实现准确识别的解决方案。

Method: 基于CLIP大模型构建多模态框架，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门设计的文本提示，以弥合预训练模型与真实监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习达到96.1%总体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%。在少样本场景下也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架能够有效解决数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别问题。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

### [59] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能。该架构包含专门为时空瞬态测量设计的注意力机制，包括时空自注意力编码器和时空交叉注意力解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在光子效率成像任务中，由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下，3D重建面临挑战。现有方法在处理低维时空瞬态数据时效果有限。

Method: 设计了TRT架构，包含两个关键组件：时空自注意力编码器通过分割或下采样输入特征到不同尺度来探索瞬态数据的局部和全局相关性；时空交叉注意力解码器在token空间中整合局部和全局特征，生成具有高表示能力的深度特征。

Result: 在合成数据和不同成像系统捕获的真实数据上，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个具体实现都显著优于现有方法。同时贡献了一个大规模高分辨率合成LOS数据集和一组真实NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构通过专门设计的时空注意力机制，有效提升了光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，为LOS和NLOS成像提供了通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI是一种能够生成无限长度视频的方法，通过错误回收微调技术解决自回归生成中的误差累积问题，实现高时间一致性和可控的故事流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减轻误差累积，但仍局限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。核心挑战在于训练假设（使用干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（依赖自生成、易出错输出）之间的根本差异。

Method: 提出错误回收微调技术，通过闭环回收将DiT自生成错误转化为监督提示，让模型主动识别和纠正自身错误。具体包括：注入历史错误干预干净输入、一步双向积分近似预测、动态将错误存入重放记忆库。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨骼、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限时长视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件设置方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: 提出了TEMA-LLM框架，通过大语言模型生成语义标签，结合多注意力机制来改进跨域序列推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域的用户行为模式，以提供个性化消费体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与物品标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的物品表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制来联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力整合为面向消费者的推荐系统带来了显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能、用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病的早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 使用消费级设备拍摄的视频作为诊断基础，提出HMVDx框架，将动作理解和疾病诊断分别由两个MLLM完成，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可用性指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLM在医疗应用中的潜力，为MLLM在医疗视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文通过建立零样本基准测试，系统评估了视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测任务中的表现，发现尽管VLMs资源消耗大，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专门化的小型模型，但在图像扰动鲁棒性方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用的大型视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专门构建模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估前3名开源VLMs，使用任务对齐提示，并与现有的视觉专用和多模态方法进行对比分析。

Result: VLMs虽然参数多、推理慢、资源密集，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于专门化的小型模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专门化模型，但在鲁棒性方面具有优势，需要进一步优化才能充分发挥其潜力。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射影像问答中容易产生幻觉的问题，提高诊断答案的可靠性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，通过温度1.0生成15次回答，计算DSE来量化语义不一致性，过滤高熵问题。

Result: 过滤高熵问题(DSE > 0.3)后，GPT-4o准确率从51.7%提升到76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升到63.8%，效果显著。

Conclusion: DSE能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，显著提高诊断准确性，为临床VLM应用提供有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的视觉感知策略优化方法VPPO，通过分析token级别的视觉依赖性来改进多模态强化学习，在8个基准测试中显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态推理方法在RLVR优化过程中忽视了视觉感知的关键作用，本文从token感知的新视角探索多模态RLVR，旨在更有效地提升模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出视觉感知策略优化VPPO算法，通过双重机制：基于整体视觉依赖性重新加权轨迹优势，并仅对感知关键token进行策略更新。

Result: 在8个感知和推理基准测试中，VPPO相比领先的开源RL调优模型取得了显著提升，在7B和32B模型规模上均验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为分析多模态RLVR建立了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种新颖有效的优化策略，显著增强了LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，表明视觉信息搜索具有最优效率。通过CNN模型可以从图像结构预测注视热点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态在注意力建模和视觉界面中有广泛应用。

Method: 进行大规模人类被试实验，40名参与者观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。分析注视轨迹统计特性，并训练CNN从图像输入预测注视热图。

Result: 分析显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建了CapGeo-Bench数据集来评估几何描述模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本形式描述，将视觉内容转换为文本描述是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过几何图形描述辅助推理，将视觉内容转换为文本描述来桥接视觉和文本模态。同时提出了CapGeo-Bench数据集和基于关键点的评估指标来系统评估几何描述模型。

Result: 实验显示使用描述后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。提出的关键点评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述可以有效解决几何推理的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该技术为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来增强自监督单目深度估计，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更充分的上下文信息来提升深度估计质量。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上集成相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例级一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，取得了优越性能

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: PPFN方法有效解决了热红外图像增强中的耦合退化问题，建立了高质量的多场景红外基准数据集，在复杂退化场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个以视觉为中心的推理基准，专注于挑战性的感知任务，要求模型仅从视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，需要细粒度观察和分析推理。


<details>

Method: BLINK-Twice包含三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型测试视觉推理能力、自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容、带注释的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程。

Result: 评估了20个领先的MLLMs，包括12个基础模型和8个推理增强模型。BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成了显著挑战，现有语言空间的推理策略虽然能提高性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。

Conclusion: 重复图像观察能提高模型性能，像o3这样的主动视觉交互模型表明需要新的视觉推理范式。数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市场景中，由于观察视锥体不重叠，往往导致点覆盖不均匀和不完整，从而产生失真和伪影。

Method: 1. 通过体素化可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构
2. 使用多样性感知视图选择策略选取信息丰富的支持视图
3. 基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构

Conclusion: VAD-GS框架能够在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元，为挑战性城市场景的几何恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务中推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在目标检测等任务中。本文旨在利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2) MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS方法实现了85-95%的激活稀疏度，在保持甚至提高性能的同时显著减少了计算量。

Conclusion: MGS提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在无需完整模型重新训练的情况下实现预训练视觉transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的文本驱动4D场景编辑框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景中语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: DWTA-Net是一个两阶段低光视频增强框架，通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索来抑制噪声和伪影，在真实低光视频中实现卓越的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在真实低光场景中仍难以处理严重噪声，主要原因是无法有效利用时间信息。

Method: 第一阶段使用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入基于动态权重的时间聚合循环细化模块，通过光流引导自适应平衡静态和动态区域。

Result: 在真实低光视频上的实验表明，DWTA-Net能有效抑制噪声和伪影。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期时间线索，在低光视频增强方面优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于森林环境中的树木实例分割和物种分类，包含1476棵树木、24个物种，在五个生物气候区域收集。基准测试显示树木分割相对容易，但物种分类仍然具有挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林管理机器人面临复杂自然环境感知的挑战，现有数据集主要关注城市环境或物种数量有限，无法满足精确林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候区域收集林冠下图像，由林业专家标注1476棵树木的24个物种，创建SilvaScenes数据集，并使用现代深度学习方法进行实例分割基准测试。

Result: 树木分割表现良好，最高平均精度(mAP)达67.65%，但物种分类仍然困难，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境感知数据集的空白，展示了树木分割相对可行而物种分类仍需改进，为森林管理机器人的发展提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比式视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差

Method: 采用维度熵最大化，将文本特征分布正则化趋向均匀分布，以减少对主导维度的依赖

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中的校准性能退化，为实际部署场景中视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化方法能有效改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的校准性能，增强模型在现实部署中的可靠性

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 解决动画和游戏行业需要从少量参考角色生成大量新角色，同时保持艺术风格一致性的问题。

Method: 基于DreamBooth框架，采用多token策略（为单个角色和集体风格分配独立token），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机token和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上评估，通过定量指标和人工评估证明能够生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了少样本角色生成问题，在保持艺术风格一致性的同时实现了无限角色创作，具有在动画和游戏领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代多模态大语言模型在具身AI中利用其广泛常识进行高级规划，但它们对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的视觉问答数据集，评估三个难度级别：工具识别（识别工具主要功能）、工具理解（理解工具操作原理）、工具创造（在缺乏传统工具时用周围物体创造新工具）。

Result: 对32个多模态大语言模型的全面评估显示，这些模型在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，包括专有模型、开源模型、专用具身模型和VLA骨干模型。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在物理工具理解方面存在明显不足，需要进一步研究和改进，作者提供了深入分析和初步解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中的对角线伪影对PRNU相机源验证的影响，以及这些伪影在法证应用中的潜在价值。

Method: 分析多个三星手机型号的图像，比较普通模式和PRO模式RAW图像的差异，研究伪影对PRNU验证的影响。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列型号存在共同的伪影模式，导致指纹碰撞；支持RAW捕获的设备仍可进行可靠PRNU验证；伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位肖像模式中的合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但RAW图像可规避此问题；这些伪影在法证应用中具有实用价值，可用于图像分析和区域定位。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测因像素表示有限导致特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节往往偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含渐进细化颈部（PRN）通过骨干网重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐，以及增强切片采样（ESSamp）通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的大量实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法，实现了优越的精度-效率权衡。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功解决了航拍图像小目标检测中的信息退化问题，在保持实时性的同时提升了检测精度。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行变形建模时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且难以有效对齐特征。

Method: 将变形重新定义为微分向量流的构造过程，将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像变形、高斯溅射变形等多种应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，并具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FLOWING通过流中心方法实现了原则性和稳定的变换，能够准确且保持结构地进行2D图像和3D形状变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型方法，通过超网络动态生成LoRA适配器来调节模型权重，实现基于时间和用户条件的动态控制，相比静态激活修改方法显著提升了生成质量和空间条件遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可控扩散模型使用固定的架构和静态条件策略来修改中间激活，无法适应多阶段去噪过程中从粗到细的动态变化，限制了模型根据生成阶段调整响应的能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络根据时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接调节冻结骨干网络的权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据领域的实验中，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过更深层的权重功能适配来修改模型的条件策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的根本性约束，现有方法通常孤立处理这些任务，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，通过原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级Transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、基于对齐的分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于先前的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在少样本和开放集场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了推理时的灵活性，支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应而无需重新训练，为生物医学目标检测提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

TL;DR: 提出基于蒸馏的框架，通过从预训练的小型动作模型转移知识，为视觉语言模型赋予动作执行能力，显著降低训练成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型训练成本高昂，需要更高效的方法来为预训练视觉语言模型添加动作能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先进行轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；然后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%），真实世界实验中达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法能有效让视觉语言模型生成精确动作，同时大幅减少训练成本，性能优于教师模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时理解无限视觉输入而设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练与流式推理框架，在保持紧凑KV缓存的同时实现稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用激增的问题，需要一种能够实时理解长视频的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一框架对齐训练与流式推理，在推理时维护包含注意力sink状态、近期视觉token短窗口和近期文本token长窗口的紧凑KV缓存，通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM通过创新的流式推理框架和训练策略，成功解决了长视频理解中的计算和延迟问题，同时提升了通用视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioNER任务中的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略来改善基因和化学实体分类错误，在开发集上F1分数从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测集上效果未泛化。

Motivation: 解决生物医学命名实体识别中相似实体类型（如基因和化学物质）难以区分的问题，提升模型性能。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理策略在开发集上显著提升性能（F1从0.79到0.83），但在盲测集上表现不佳（F1从0.79降至0.77），存在过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化方法对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但需解决开发数据过拟合问题，确保模型在真实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时缩放（TTS）方法存在一个未被识别的安全漏洞：当候选响应多样性受限时，TTS更容易产生不安全输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中关于候选响应多样性假设的安全隐患，证明多样性受限会导致安全风险显著增加。

Method: 提出RefDiv诊断攻击协议，通过参考引导的多样性减少来压力测试TTS管道，在四个开源模型和两种TTS策略上进行实验验证。

Result: 多样性受限显著提高TTS产生不安全结果的概率，效果甚至超过高对抗意图的提示，且该现象在不同TTS策略和闭源模型中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 现有安全防护措施对多样性驱动的失效模式防护有限，需要设计更鲁棒的TTS策略来抵御此类攻击。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC架构，通过跨注意力整合多层自监督学习特征，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，在语音抑郁检测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法通常只使用SSL模型的最后一层或寻找单一最佳层，容易过拟合特定数据集，无法充分利用层次结构来检测细微且持续的抑郁信号。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含两个关键模块：层次自适应聚类模块将SSL特征重组为互补嵌入，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系，结合CTC目标实现对齐感知训练。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的macro F1分数，在标准数据划分和五折交叉验证两种设置下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层SSL特征和CTC损失，能够更好地捕捉抑郁语音中的稀疏、异质时间模式，在语音抑郁检测任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 解决人工智能领域关于机器学习模型数学理解程度的核心问题，超越标准基准测试来诊断具体失败点。

Method: 首先让GPT-3.5-turbo在GSM8K数据集上生成结构化、逐步推理，然后用更强大的GPT-4o-mini模型对错误进行分类，并通过无监督聚类识别出现的"推理模式"。

Result: 揭示了模型认知特征的显著非人类脆弱性：在顺序计算等程序性模式上准确率接近完美，但在需要组合推理和限制条件的模式上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 通过识别和量化这些不同推理技能的可靠性，为评估数学理解提供了更细粒度的方法，并为开发新能力和更可靠的未来应用提供了精确路线图。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无参考指标如自困惑度对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要更公平的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布中推导出置信度评分(CS)，在99个创意提示上对比CS与传统流畅度指标的表现。

Result: CS在19%情况下偏好新颖回答，而传统指标为0%，差异具有统计显著性(95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%])。CS能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: 置信度评分减轻了传统指标对创造力的偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供更平衡的评估。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化如量化、剪枝、格式转换等可能导致语言模型性能下降，现有研究主要关注量化恢复，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的源中恢复模型精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小型语言模型上，Recover-LoRA将模型精度恢复了5-17%，适用于MHA和GQA注意力架构。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA能有效恢复因各种原因退化的模型精度，是一种通用的精度恢复方法。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一个受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的大语言模型设计，通过图结构存储、记忆过滤和概率召回机制，在医疗对话场景中显著优于传统检索增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，无法在资源受限的边缘设备上有效处理长期记忆，特别是在医疗等需要处理时间序列相似对话的场景中。

Method: 采用图结构存储，包含模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于时间衰减和刷新过程的概率召回机制，还引入了浓缩的"核心摘要"来捕捉用户个性和长期细节。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话实验中，Mnemosyne在盲测人类评估中获得65.8%的最高胜率（基线RAG为31.1%），在LoCoMo基准测试中在时间推理和单跳检索方面达到当前最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI等常用方法。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne证明了通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以显著改善事实召回、增强时间推理能力，并生成更自然的用户响应。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为离群检测问题能够显著提高模型的泛化能力，该方法在各种复杂场景下都表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在病理学等高门槛领域仍存在幻觉问题。现有方法依赖领域微调，但无法扩展知识边界或强制证据约束。

Method: 构建了覆盖28个子领域、153万段落的病理学向量数据库，开发了YpathRAG框架，包含双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块。

Result: 在YpathR基准上，Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M的300个最具挑战性问题集上，通用和医疗LLM的准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: YpathRAG显著改善了检索质量和事实可靠性，为面向病理学的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感热点的统一模型，通过检测文本、音频和视频中的情感热点，使用热点门控融合和路由混合对齐器来改善多模态情感识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的情感识别困难，因为判别性证据稀疏、局部化且跨模态异步。需要关注情感热点来改善识别效果。

Method: 检测每个话语在文本、音频和视频中的情感热点，通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征融合，使用路由混合对齐器对齐模态，并通过跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中表现优于强基线模型，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的贡献。

Conclusion: 基于情感热点的视角可以为未来多模态学习提供参考，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA框架评估LLMs在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识，包含27,000个多语言多模态问题，79%需要基于文化背景的多步推理，是首个在文本、图像和语音三种模态输入对齐的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在西方高资源环境外的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要评估其在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识。

Method: 构建多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集，包含五维评估协议，使用文化意识基础验证模块检测捷径学习，并通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和视觉消融前缀重放方法分析模型差异。

Result: 提出了首个在文本、图像和语音三种模态输入对齐的数据集，能够直接测试跨模态迁移，并建立了系统的文化意识评估框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建文化可靠的多模态LLMs提供了可操作的见解，揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间差异的原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphGhost是一个统一框架，将神经元激活及其信号传播表示为图，用于分析LLMs如何从序列输入中捕获结构语义并通过结构一致机制生成输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 采用基于图的视角，将神经元激活和信号传播建模为图结构，并应用PageRank等图算法来表征LLMs的特性。

Result: 揭示了不同数据集中共享和模型特定的推理行为，通过结构干预发现编辑关键神经元节点会导致推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和最终理解LLMs推理结构基础的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中对患者性别相关性的判断存在不一致性，特别是在性别相关性评估方面，这可能导致临床实践中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用日益广泛，但其对性别偏见的敏感性可能影响临床决策的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛的案例研究，为多个开源和专有LLM分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估其在诊断和患者性别相关性判断方面的一致性。

Result: 大多数模型在诊断方面相对一致，但在患者性别相关性和必要性判断方面，所有模型都表现出显著的不一致性，特别是在相关性判断方面，某些模型甚至显示出系统性的性别差异。

Conclusion: 这种未被充分探索的偏见可能削弱LLM在临床实践中的可靠性，强调需要定期检查与LLM交互时的身份分配一致性，以确保可靠和公平的AI支持临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用大语言模型自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，该框架能保持原问题的解决方案不变，大大减少了人工生成干扰条件的成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，缺乏有干扰条件的问题。虽然研究表明大语言模型在面对干扰条件时性能会显著下降，但现有的干扰条件数据集难度低、表达不自然，导致干扰条件容易被检测和忽略，降低了基准测试的可信度。

Method: 设计了一个迭代框架，利用大语言模型从多个视角和认知层次自动生成干扰条件。通过特定的提示词设计，引导模型创建有意义的干扰条件，同时确保原始问题的解决方案保持不变，无需重新编写答案。

Result: 该框架高效且易于部署，显著减少了生成带干扰条件的数学应用题所需的工作量，同时保持了高质量的数据生成。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够自动生成具有挑战性的干扰条件，解决了现有数据集在干扰条件设计上的不足，为大语言模型在数学推理能力评估方面提供了更可靠的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

### [111] [LLMs Show Surface-Form Brittleness Under Paraphrase Stress Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08616)
*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现来探测LLM泛化能力的简单协议，发现改写会导致准确率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项目或其近似重复项而被夸大，需要检测模型是否真正理解而非依赖表面形式捷径。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上比较原始问题和改写问题的准确率差距，采用控制解码、强制多选输出格式和鲁棒的改写清理步骤。

Result: 改写会导致非平凡的准确率下降（原始vs改写），这与之前关于污染和脆弱的表面形式捷径的担忧一致。

Conclusion: 基准测试可能存在污染问题，模型可能过度依赖表面形式而非真正理解，需要更严格的评估方法来检测泛化能力。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从较小的英语模型扩展参数空间，专门集成泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能侵蚀模型原有的知识。需要一种既能保留通用智能又能有效集成泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从高性能英语开源LLM出发，扩展参数空间，利用新增容量系统集成泰语知识。预训练使用1.5T令牌（含300B+泰语令牌），随后进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）上表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了上扩增和知识集成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: JAI-1的上扩增方法成功保留了原始模型的通用智能，同时建立了独特的架构，为未来可扩展增强奠定了基础。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Motivation: 随着智能对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟器研究来优化有效的对话策略。

Method: 开发了一个销售导向的对话代理，根据用户的年龄、性别和职业调整对话策略，特别关注职业对对话意图的影响。

Result: 年龄和性别影响整体性能，但职业对对话意图产生最显著差异。基于职业的轻量级策略能缩短对话并提高成功率。

Conclusion: 丰富的用户模拟器配置和基于个人信息的简单策略可以显著提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: Text2Stories是一个用于评估软件需求生成任务中文本与故事对齐度的框架，通过正确性和完整性指标量化用户故事是否忠实反映利益相关者需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否准确反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工。需要一种可量化的方法来评估需求生成的质量。

Method: 将访谈记录分割成文本块，将文本与故事的对齐问题建模为块与故事之间的匹配问题。使用基于LLM的匹配器和嵌入模型来实现对齐评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏观F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型的性能较差但可用于有效的块筛选。

Conclusion: Text2Stories提供了一个可扩展的、忠实于源文本的补充方法，能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成与自动生成）的质量，为现有用户故事质量标准提供了有价值的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升了从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将JSON模式视为静态合约，导致提取性能不佳、幻觉频繁和代理行为不可靠，特别是在模式包含模糊或不完整规范时。

Method: 开发PARSE系统，包含ARCHITECT（自动优化JSON模式）和SCOPE（基于反射的提取与防护机制）两个协同组件。

Result: 在SWDE数据集上提取准确率提升64.7%，综合框架改进达10%，首次重试减少92%的提取错误，同时保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为可解释和改进的自然语言理解合约，显著提升了结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现评估导向的提示会夸大LLM性能，增加推理长度但未必提升准确率，建议采用中性措辞和双重框架检查来确保基准测试反映实际部署能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查评估导向的提示是否会夸大LLM性能而不带来相应能力提升，因为实际部署需要简洁、契约约束的答案而非冗长的推理过程。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型进行六组A/B测试，固定任务内容和解码，仅改变框架（评估导向vs实际世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确率、答案合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理长度（数百到1000+字符），降低答案合规性，准确率提升有限或不一致。激励措辞会改变错误构成，多语言标题会重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 需要采用中性措辞、双重框架检查、契约感知评分等方法来确保基准测试收益反映可部署能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: PULSE框架使用小型语言模型生成推理文本作为主要学习信号，替代大型语言模型的高成本推理，在多领域推荐任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理成本高，小型语言模型推理能力未被充分探索，现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理文本作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的推理文本作为直接学习信号，与交互历史共同监督，联合建模用户行为及其语义驱动因素。

Result: PULSE在多个基准数据集上优于主流ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的顺序推荐模型，在跨领域推荐和推理问答任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: PULSE通过将推理文本作为一等学习信号，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入表示，为高效推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: ExPO-HM提出了一种新的仇恨表情包检测方法，通过解释-检测策略优化，结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵，在三个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为二元预测，缺乏上下文和解释，无法满足实际审核需求。现有的解释-检测方法性能不如简单SFT基线，存在关键政策相关线索未被假设和二元奖励信号不足的问题。

Method: ExPO-HM结合SFT预热、GRPO课程学习和条件决策熵(CDE)作为推理质量的度量和奖励，模仿人类标注者的训练和评估过程。

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面达到最先进性能，相比GRPO和DPO基线分别提升15%和17%的F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供了准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO

binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

TL;DR: HDLM是一种新颖的分层扩散语言模型，通过分层词汇表实现从粗粒度到细粒度的语义生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型在语言建模中缺乏层次化语义表示，HDLM旨在通过分层词汇结构实现更有效的语义尺度预测。

Method: 使用分层词汇表，前向过程将token扰动到更高层次的抽象语义，反向过程逐步预测更详细的语义，实现时间变化的语义尺度预测。

Result: 实验验证HDLM在文本生成中表现出更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HDLM为语言建模提供了一种通用的分层扩散框架，能够有效建模语义层次结构，并在生成质量上取得显著提升。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效的推理框架，通过前期思想嵌入实现CoT压缩，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少推理长度，在GSM8K数据集上可减少50%的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长链式思维(CoT)在大型语言模型中计算成本高、延迟大的问题，避免现有方法需要繁琐的手动提示设计或牺牲关键推理细节的缺点。

Method: 采用小模型(压缩器)和大模型(执行器)的协作工作流：第一阶段训练压缩器生成富含推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化执行器利用这些嵌入以简短推理得出正确答案。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT将Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型的token使用量减少50%，性能比最先进方法提高3.08%。

Conclusion: UCoT框架有效实现了CoT压缩，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升了效率，为大型语言模型的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析个人叙事风格的正式框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，自动提取语言特征来分析作者表达主观体验时的语言选择模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事是作者构建意义的故事，风格对传达主观体验至关重要，但目前缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析语言选择模式。

Result: 在数百个梦境叙事中应用该框架，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 本研究利用LLM处理定性文本数据，结合传统评分量表创建增强型心理测试，在抑郁症评估中显著提高了测量精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息，需要开发能整合定性数据的新方法。

Method: 开发了一个结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的新框架，在真实世界高中生样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)上进行验证，基于项目信息计算经验性地选择最有信息量的LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计显著改进。LLM项目的信息增益相当于在原始19项测试中增加了6.3(真实数据)至16.0(合成数据)个项目。

Conclusion: 该框架为利用日益增长的转录文本流增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展方法，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值，代表了绕过传统自动化评分瓶颈的概念转变。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个高效可扩展的扩散大语言模型推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归模型的替代方案具有并行生成优势，但缺乏标准化高效推理框架限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件（模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略、KV缓存管理器），结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval基准测试达到1100+ tokens/s，六个基准平均800+ tokens/s；相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer为扩散大语言模型提供了高效推理解决方案，显著提升了推理速度而不损失模型性能，推动了dLLM的实际应用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

TL;DR: 首次对代码LLM的缩放规律进行大规模实证研究，发现代码比自然语言更数据饥渴，需要更高的数据-参数比，且代码-NL混合训练在资源受限时有益但在高计算预算时有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放规律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言在严格语法等方面存在根本差异，需要研究代码LLM的缩放规律。

Method: 进行117次实验运行，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合Chinchilla和Farsser定律。

Result: Farsser定律更准确；代码LLM随模型规模有效缩放；代码比自然语言需要更高数据-参数比；代码-NL混合训练在资源受限时有益但在高计算预算时有害。

Conclusion: 代码LLM的缩放规律与自然语言不同，需要专门优化训练策略，特别是在数据使用和代码-NL混合训练方面。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在复杂、细致的法律案例推理中的能力，特别是类比和区分先例的能力，这在法律实践中至关重要。

Method: 提出一个正式框架，将案例区分过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，组织成法律知识层次结构，并定义可验证的规则来识别区分、分析论证支持和评估重要性。

Result: 现代推理大语言模型在表面推理（任务1）上准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上性能显著下降。模型在错误回答上消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法学，揭示了必须解决的基本限制，以实现稳健和可信赖的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Motivation: 现有基准存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误而非关键故障的问题，需要找到最小错误代码集和测试用例集来准确评估LLM生成的测试用例。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为矩阵秩问题，提出WrongSelect近似算法选择最大多样性的错误代码，基于数百万竞赛编程提交构建TC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗膨胀的基准，有效评估测试用例生成方法的诊断能力。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中传统基准测试耗时耗成本的问题，探究微基准测试能否替代完整基准测试来一致性地排名模型。

Method: 引入元评估方法，分析微基准测试在不同模型性能差异下的排名一致性，比较不同样本大小和选择方法的效果。

Result: 微基准测试无法可靠地区分MMLU-Pro上3.5分或BIG-bench Hard上4分性能差异的模型对，需要250个样本才能获得可靠排名，此时随机采样与现有方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在效率和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要更多样本才能获得一致排名，为微基准测试用户和开发者提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic

this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional

reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别的响应，并改进这些领域。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention机制，通过概率性、分层token选择在全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，仅保留30-50%的token即可保持95%以上性能，同时显著降低内存消耗并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制随序列长度呈二次方增长O(n²)，限制了长上下文应用，需要解决计算和内存效率问题。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛进行训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，实现可微分且可直接替换标准编码器的token选择机制。

Result: 在分类、抽取式问答和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token就能保持≥95%的完整模型性能，峰值内存降低约35-45%，吞吐量提升高达约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力机制或任务头的情况下，为长上下文应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLMs在中文知识推理方面的不足，检索增强是有效的改进方法，为未来模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

### [133] [The Model's Language Matters: A Comparative Privacy Analysis of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08813)
*Abhishek K. Mishra,Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言结构对LLM隐私泄露的影响，发现意大利语隐私泄露最严重，英语成员推断分离性更高，而法语和西班牙语由于形态复杂性更具韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在多语言应用中部署增加，处理敏感数据时的隐私风险日益突出。现有研究主要针对英语，需要了解语言结构如何影响隐私泄露。

Method: 量化六种语言指标，评估三种攻击向量：提取攻击、反事实记忆和成员推断攻击，在英语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语医疗语料库上训练LLM。

Result: 隐私漏洞与语言冗余和分词粒度相关：意大利语泄露最严重，英语成员推断分离性更高，法语和西班牙语因形态复杂性更抗攻击。

Conclusion: 首次提供量化证据表明语言在隐私泄露中起重要作用，强调在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-on-Graph (SoG)框架通过迭代式图导航解决LLM在知识图谱问答中的局限性，无需预规划路径或检索大子图，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型多跳问题上不可靠，会遗漏长尾事实、产生幻觉且知识滞后；现有KGQA方法面临查询编译困难、子图检索噪声大和搜索空间指数级扩张等问题。

Method: 提出SoG框架，采用"观察-然后导航"原则，让LLM在每一步检查当前实体的可用关系后再决定下一跳，使用单一Search函数实现迭代式图导航。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，无需微调，在Wikidata基准上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase基准上也有持续改进。

Conclusion: SoG框架通过简单有效的迭代图导航方法，成功解决了LLM在KGQA中的关键挑战，展示了在不同知识图谱模式上的良好适应性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PE-CoA框架，使用五种对话模式构建多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10种危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模型特定的脆弱性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，不同对话模式与模型脆弱性之间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 提出Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA)框架，包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建有效的多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10种危害类别上评估，达到最先进性能，发现模型具有特定的脆弱性模式，对一种对话模式的鲁棒性不能泛化到其他模式，模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了文档级翻译中的质量估计重排序方法，发现使用SLIDE和GEMBA-DA等质量估计指标，在仅使用2-32个候选翻译的情况下，能显著提升BLEURT-20分数，证明文档级质量估计重排序具有实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，需要探索其在文档级翻译中的表现。

Method: 使用各种学习型和基于大语言模型的质量估计指标（如SLIDE和GEMBA-DA），在文档级翻译任务中对生成的翻译候选进行评分和选择。

Result: 使用最佳学习型指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20分数在2个候选翻译下提升+2.00，在32个候选翻译下提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，分别提升+1.63和+4.30。即使在最长文档（512-1024源标记）上，使用32个候选翻译仍能获得+2.34（SLIDE）和+1.40（GEMBA-DA）的提升。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，仅需最小的运行时开销即可显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing是首个针对财务审计任务的基准测试，评估LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档上的推理能力，包含三个子任务：语义一致性、关系一致性和数值一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使财务审计难以自动化和验证，而LLM在结构化财务文档推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 从真实的US-GAAP合规XBRL申报文件中构建FinAuditing基准，定义三个互补子任务，并提出统一的评估框架整合检索、分类和推理指标。

Result: 对13个最先进LLM的零样本实验显示，当前模型在语义、关系和数学维度上表现不一致，在分层多文档结构推理时准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类法的财务推理方面存在系统性限制，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知且符合监管要求的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在强化学习中为不同token类型应用不同温度设置的方法，通过提高推理token的温度来鼓励探索，同时保持知识token的低温以确保事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段明确促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 引入多温度采样方法，对推理token使用较高温度以鼓励探索，对知识token使用较低温度以保持事实正确性，并系统研究多种多温度调度策略。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同token类型应用差异化温度设置，能够有效提升LLM在强化学习环境中的推理能力，该方法是对现有方法的有效补充。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: 提出SAC方法，通过选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免自编码训练，实现更有效的上下文压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自编码任务的上下文压缩方法存在训练目标与下游任务不匹配的问题，削弱了实际使用中的特征有效性。

Method: SAC直接选择原始上下文中的锚点token，通过锚点嵌入和双向注意力修改来聚合上下文信息到KV表示中。

Result: SAC在各种压缩比下均优于现有方法，在MRQA上5倍压缩时EM提升1分，压缩比越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接利用上下文token表示，无需自编码训练，实现了更有效的上下文压缩，在多种场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究LLM内部是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的表示模式，以及这些模式如何影响模型的下游行为。

Method: 使用线性探针在生成的提示上预测基于二维刻板印象内容模型(SCM)的印象，分析隐藏表示中印象的可解码性及其与模型响应的关系。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时不一致地报告印象，但从隐藏表示中能更一致地线性解码印象；人工印象能预测模型响应的质量和使用对冲语言的程度；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM的印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些印象影响模型行为，提示特征会塑造这些印象，为理解LLM的社会偏见提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估大语言模型的指令遵循和决策能力，但在涉及复杂标准操作流程的业务场景中的评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 将SOP任务分为两类：横向根系统（LRS）需要精确选择的宽选项任务，和心根系统（HRS）强调复杂分支深度逻辑推理的任务。

Result: 实验表明几乎所有最先进模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个关键错误类别：流程盲区、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 该系统性研究探索了大语言模型在挑战广度和深度的SOP任务中的表现，为改进模型能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Method: 使用710个项目的配对快照语料库，将文本解析为参与者、规则、行动和对象，通过熵、丰富度和Jensen Shannon散度测量变化。

Result: 项目随时间定义更多角色和行动，且分布更均衡，而规则组成保持稳定。

Conclusion: 治理通过扩展和平衡参与类别而发展，未发生重大规范性转变，为评估AI工作流对权力分配的影响提供基线。

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and support for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的RLVR方法采用静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的动态变化，导致训练过程中对不同难度样本的关注不平衡，从而限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出DARO方法，根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决训练过程中的损失规模问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛速度更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态权重调整机制有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，为增强语言模型的推理能力提供了更有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster

*Yutao Mou,Xiaoling Zhou,Yuxiao Luo,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, with LoRA serving as cost-efficient safety patches that decouple safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions to balance safety and performance, incurring high costs with limited gains.

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training that trains solely on safety data, with LoRA decoupling safety into a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space.

Result: Demonstrates that LoRA enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when trained only on safety data, serving as cost-efficient and plug-and-play safety patches.

Conclusion: LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic capabilities, ensuring safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent model performance.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

*Shengmin Piao,Jieun Lee,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitE-SQL是一个轻量高效的Text-to-SQL框架，使用向量数据库进行模式链接，并通过两阶段微调实现自我修正，在参数减少2-30倍的情况下达到与大型语言模型相当或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的Text-to-SQL方法依赖专有模型，存在部署可行性和数据隐私问题，需要更轻量、隐私友好的解决方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：(1) 模式检索器使用预计算模式嵌入的向量数据库进行高效模式链接；(2) SQL生成器通过监督微调和执行引导的强化学习两阶段微调，实现无需多候选生成的自我修正。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%执行准确率，参数使用量比LLM方法减少2-30倍。

Conclusion: 高质量Text-to-SQL生成可以通过轻量模型实现，为隐私敏感和资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 该研究通过迭代优化评分标准来提升大语言模型在自动作文评分中的表现，在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上分别实现了最高0.19和0.47的QWK提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，研究探索通过优化评分标准来提升自动作文评分效果。

Method: 通过让模型反思自身评分理由与人工评分之间的差异，迭代优化评分标准，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct进行实验。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上分别实现了最高0.19和0.47的QWK提升，即使使用简单初始评分标准也能达到或超过详细人工编写标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代优化评分标准对于基于大语言模型的自动作文评分至关重要，能显著提升与人工评估的一致性。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究为低资源印地语系语言Chakma构建了首个上下文连贯的孟加拉语转写语料库，并通过微调6种多语言和区域transformer模型，证明孟加拉语转写Chakma对迁移学习非常有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma作为一种印地语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性严重不足，需要开发有效的处理方法来支持这种低资源语言。

Method: 从Chakma文学作品中收集语料，由母语者验证，构建孟加拉语转写的Chakma语料库，并在6种编码器型多语言transformer模型上进行掩码语言建模任务的微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在孟加拉语转写Chakma上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的token准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写Chakma对Chakma语言的迁移学习非常有效，同时揭示了数据质量对模型性能的重要影响以及OCR管道在处理形态丰富的印地文字时的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs的内部状态不能可靠地区分事实和幻觉，因为它们只编码知识回忆模式而非真实性信号。当幻觉与主题知识相关时，其内部处理过程与正确回答重叠且难以区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否真的"知道它们不知道什么"，以及内部计算能否可靠区分事实性输出和幻觉输出。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种基于主题知识依赖度的幻觉类型，分析LLMs处理事实查询时的内部状态。

Result: 发现与主题知识相关的幻觉采用与正确回答相同的内部回忆过程，隐藏状态几何重叠；而与主题知识无关的幻觉产生可检测的聚类表示。

Conclusion: LLMs不在内部状态中编码真实性，只编码知识回忆模式，因此"LLMs并不真正知道它们不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct模型，这是一个针对低资源乌尔都语的多语言模型，通过改进的自指导技术生成高质量合成数据集，在100美元预算内显著提升了乌尔都语任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发LLM面临的挑战：高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术生成高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语原生思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B等领先多语言LLM，训练成本低于100美元。

Conclusion: 证明通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言的LLM，同时实现文化对齐。所有数据集、模型和代码已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne训练框架通过监督微调和GRPO优化推理模型的可信度，提升可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，在数学基准测试中显著改善推理轨迹质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长链思维推理研究过于关注答案准确性和token效率，而忽视了可信度这一关键维度。可用的推理系统必须具有可信赖性，包括可解释性、忠实性和可靠性三个属性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，鼓励模型：(i)生成结构化、基于标签的推理轨迹，提高可解释性；(ii)明确披露指导每个解决方案的决定性信息，保持跨部分引用一致性；(iii)提供推导过程合理性和最终答案置信度的自我评估。

Result: 在Qwen3模型(1.7B/4B/8B)上应用ReFIne，在数学基准测试中显示：推理轨迹更清晰结构化(可解释性+44.0%)，更忠实暴露决策过程(忠实性+18.8%)，提供信息丰富的置信度估计(可靠性+42.4%)。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应优化可信度的更广泛维度。ReFIne框架为构建可信赖推理系统提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果语言模型(CLM)的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程和深度度量学习获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型(CLM)在多种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。研究者希望探索CLM在此任务上的潜力，特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的语言如日语。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1) 使用提示工程让CLM输出代表给定情境的框架名称；2) 结合上下文学习(ICL)和深度度量学习(DML)获得更适合框架归纳的嵌入表示；3) 对生成的嵌入进行聚类完成框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的框架归纳方法。特别是对于日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CLM可以成功应用于语义框架归纳任务，FrameEOL方法在资源匮乏的语言上尤其有效，为框架归纳提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速演化的信息或领域特定查询，RAG通过集成外部检索机制来解决这一限制。

Method: 通过综述分析RAG的总体目标、核心组件、关键挑战和局限性，并展示RAG与LLMs结合的应用案例。

Result: 识别了RAG的关键弱点，展示了在LLMs单独表现不佳但结合RAG能显著提升效果的多个应用场景。

Conclusion: 鼓励研究人员重新思考RAG的角色，并激发下一代RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

Motivation: 现有翻译基准依赖表层指标，无法捕捉网络小说的独特特征，需要专门评估框架来评估叙事和文化保真度。

Method: 引入DITING评估框架，包含六个维度评估；提出AgentEval多智能体评估框架模拟专家审议；开发MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 中文训练的LLM超越更大的国外模型，DeepSeek-V3提供最忠实和风格一致的翻译；AgentEval在七个自动指标中与人类判断相关性最高。

Conclusion: 为探索基于LLM的网络小说翻译建立了新范式，并提供公共资源推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Motivation: 为了更准确地建模文本聊天中个体的性格特征，研究者希望通过思维话语来增强对话数据，使LLM能更好地模仿说话者的人格特质。

Method: 使用思维话语增强对话数据来训练人格LLM，思维话语是指说话者在表达前对其想法的言语化。通过Big Five人格框架评估训练后LLM的人格特征。

Result: 使用思维话语增强数据训练的LLM在Big Five人格特质中的宜人性和神经质方面与说话者更接近，且增强质量影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 思维话语增强能有效提升LLM对说话者人格特质的模拟能力，特别是在宜人性和神经质维度，且增强质量是关键因素。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以有效评估其保护个人身份信息的能力，需要通过反向的重识别攻击来测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 探索PII跨度重识别顺序的重要性，通过聚合多个顺序的预测来改进结果；2. 使用推理模型提升重识别性能，特别是在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识的情况下。

Result: 两种策略都能显著提升重识别攻击的效果，推理模型在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识时表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 通过优化重识别顺序和使用推理模型，可以构建更强大的重识别攻击来更准确地评估文本去标识化方法的有效性。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，翻译增强模型又缺乏推理能力。需要一种方法能同时兼顾翻译和推理能力。

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据对特定层进行选择性调优，提出了Qwen3-XPlus模型。

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上都取得显著提升，低资源语言达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet，同时在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可及性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型(SLMs)对大型语言模型(LLMs)的输出进行思维链修正，解决LLMs在推理任务中忽视输出格式要求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽视详细的输出格式要求，而直接微调LLMs成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: DICE采用两阶段方法构建结构化思维链适应数据集，然后通过双调优策略微调SLMs，以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明DICE将LLM输出的格式准确性和内容正确性分别提高了35.4%和29.4%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保持LLMs广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

*Tao Feng,Lizhen Qu,Niket Tandon,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS是一个实时因果发现框架，通过结合统计算法和LLM方法自动收集文档、提取变量并发现已知和新型因果关系，无需预存数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现方法面临数据收集成本高、已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等挑战，而现有LLM方法只能发现已知关系无法发现新型关系。

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量集开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量，采用统计算法和LLM混合方法进行因果发现，并通过缺失变量提议组件扩展因果图。

Result: IRIS能够实时发现已知和新型因果关系，无需预存数据集，通过迭代检索和集成系统实现完整的因果发现流程。

Conclusion: IRIS框架成功解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，实现了从初始变量集开始的实时、全面的因果发现，能够发现已知和新型因果关系。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

*Giacomo Gonella,Gian Maria Campedelli,Stefano Menini,Marco Guerini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrisiText数据集，这是首个大规模危机预警消息生成数据集，包含13种危机场景下的40多万条预警消息，用于研究NLG技术在危机应对中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害或暴力袭击等危机情况下，及时生成预警消息对保护民众安全至关重要。虽然AI已用于辅助人类应对危机，但NLP技术的应用仍有限，主要集中在分类任务上，而利用NLG架构生成及时预警消息的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 从现有危机描述出发，创建与场景相关的事件链，每个事件配对一条预警消息。消息生成遵循专家指南以确保术语准确性和事实性。数据集还包含三种次优预警类型，用于研究不同NLG方法。实验比较了监督微调、偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法。

Result: 构建了包含40多万条预警消息的大规模数据集，覆盖13种危机场景和近18,000个危机情境。实验评估了不同NLG方法的性能，包括分布外场景下的表现和自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机预警消息生成领域的空白，为研究NLG技术在危机应对中的应用提供了重要资源，展示了及时预警消息生成的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤来增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在多个QA基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强LLM主动搜索外部知识的能力对于复杂现实任务至关重要，现有方法要么依赖提示激发模型内在能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能上限和崩溃问题。

Method: 提出动态过滤序列级策略优化(DSPO)，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤进行稳健的智能体训练，纯RL训练实现多轮搜索和推理的交错，无需监督演示数据。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，DSPO训练的7B模型比同类先前工作提升34.1%，在复杂多跳QA如HotpotQA上甚至比先前工作的14B模型相对提升近9%，且保持出色的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: DSPO算法能够有效挖掘LLM的智能体潜力，在复杂知识搜索任务中实现显著性能提升和稳定的训练过程。

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-Critique方法，首次系统研究RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测问题，通过检测模型输出熵分布崩溃来识别污染样本，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RL后训练在LLM推理能力提升中的重要性增加，现有污染检测方法主要针对预训练和SFT阶段，而RL阶段的专门检测方法存在研究空白，这构成了关键漏洞。

Method: 提出Self-Critique方法，基于RL后训练导致模型输出熵分布崩溃到特定稀疏模式的观察，通过探测底层策略崩溃（模型收敛到狭窄推理路径）来检测污染。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上的广泛实验表明，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，而现有方法对RL阶段污染接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: Self-Critique使得RL后训练阶段的数据污染检测成为可能，填补了该领域的重要空白，为可靠评估LLM性能提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，评估多模态检索增强生成模型在视频理解中的表现，发现现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面有限，主要关注单模态或有限模态任务，缺乏对细粒度多模态信息的评估。

Method: 构建CFVBench基准测试，包含599个公开视频和5,360个开放式问答对；提出自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架，通过自适应增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来提升细粒度理解。

Result: 评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLM，发现即使是GPT5或Gemini等先进模型也难以捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节；AVR框架在所有评估的MLLM中都能持续提升细粒度多模态理解和性能。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在细粒度多模态细节理解方面存在显著瓶颈，提出的AVR框架能有效缓解这一问题，为提升视频MRAG系统的性能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的新病例，引入干扰因素和多样化表达方式，在准确性之外还评估真实性、帮助性和一致性，揭示了当前LLM与真实临床实践之间的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要依赖静态医学考试基准，高估模型性能且忽略真实临床实践中病例的模糊性和多样性，与真实临床实践存在根本性不匹配。

Method: 提出DyReMe动态基准，生成新鲜咨询式病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰项，变化表达风格模拟真实查询习惯，评估准确性、真实性、帮助性和一致性四个维度。

Result: 实验表明动态方法产生更具挑战性和真实性的评估，揭示了最先进LLM性能与真实临床实践之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为更真实的LLM医疗能力评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: CLARity是一个成本效益高的强化学习框架，使用小型通用LLM提升专家模型在稀缺数据领域的推理质量，通过一致性感知奖励机制和两阶段训练流程，显著改善推理一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖多选题。但标准的基于结果的强化学习虽然可能提高准确性，却常常损害推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有监督推理的解决方案（如大规模过程奖励模型）成本过高。

Method: 提出CLARity框架：集成一致性感知奖励机制与两阶段精炼-监控训练流程来增强推理一致性，以及动态数据重构策略以更好地利用有限数据。

Result: 实验表明CLARity相比基线方法将响应一致性提高了16.5%，准确性提高了7.5%。人工评估进一步确认了连贯性和专业性的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个可泛化的解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法为每个句子只分配单一向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，另一个表示隐式语义，在共享空间中共同存在。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能有效编码显式和隐式语义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 双嵌入方法能够克服传统单向量表示的局限性，更好地捕捉句子语义，提高下游任务效果。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，这掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了模型进展的可靠评估

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计），对抗参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性

Result: 实验表明MaP能显著平滑性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和真实的视角，为LLM研究奠定了重要实证基础

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成法院观点可能限制性能表现。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练了专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成上达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏观F1分数。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large

construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个针对扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的训练无关缓存驱逐框架，通过掩码查询引导的评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，显著减少内存占用并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有并行解码优势，但其双向注意力机制导致巨大的内存开销，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有的缓存驱逐策略专为自回归模型设计，不适用于dLLMs。

Method: 1) 掩码查询引导的评分机制：利用注意力权重识别并驱逐每个注意力头中不太重要的提示词元；2) 自适应缓存预算策略：减少中间层的缓存分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，仅使用256对KV缓存（少于5%的词元）就能在LongBench上保持94%的全缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了dLLMs的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境下的长上下文处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路推理验证(CRV)的白盒方法，通过分析正确与错误推理步骤在计算图结构上的差异来验证推理正确性，相比黑盒和灰盒方法能提供更深入的错误原因分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法基于输出或激活值，对计算失败原因提供有限洞察。需要一种能深入理解推理错误根源的方法。

Method: 将正确CoT步骤的归因图视为潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，训练分类器识别这些图的结构特征差异，从而检测推理错误。

Result: 1) 错误的结构特征具有高度预测性；2) 不同推理任务的错误特征具有领域特异性；3) 通过针对性干预可成功纠正错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过审视模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型参数量巨大，难以在资源受限硬件上部署。现有低秩压缩方法采用统一压缩率会导致性能显著下降，且在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: FLRC方法：1）为每层高效确定最优秩分配；2）结合渐进低秩解码来保持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC相比最先进的低秩压缩方法在摘要任务上ROUGE-L指标提升高达17%，建立了更稳健高效的LLM推理框架。

Conclusion: FLRC通过细粒度秩分配和渐进解码策略，显著提升了低秩压缩的效果，为大语言模型在资源受限环境中的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Motivation: 解决C2C平台上个体卖家在二手产品定价时面临的挑战，传统静态回归模型泛化能力差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: 使用LLM框架，首先检索相似产品，然后通过监督微调(SFT)和组相对策略优化(GRPO)两阶段优化，结合置信度过滤机制。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著超越了现有定价方法，具有良好的泛化能力，成功解决了二手产品动态定价问题。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ReTraceQA基准，用于评估常识推理任务的过程级质量，发现SLMs在14-24%的情况下虽然给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷，表明仅关注最终答案的评估方法高估了SLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小型语言模型(SLMs)的评估主要依赖最终答案的准确性，忽视了推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对模型能力的错误估计。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准，使用专家标注的数据集进行过程级评估，并采用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自动评判员进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现SLMs在14-24%的情况下提供正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用LLMs进行推理感知评估时，SLMs在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，得分最多降低25%。

Conclusion: 仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估SLMs的能力，过程级评估对于准确评估模型推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

TL;DR: ThinkLogit是一种无需训练的解码时方法，通过logit算术利用小推理模型引导大模型进行长推理，ThinkLogit-DPO进一步通过偏好优化训练引导模型，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否能在无需额外训练的情况下激发大模型的链式推理能力，如回溯和自我修正，这些能力通常需要专门训练。

Method: 提出ThinkLogit方法，使用logit算术将小推理模型作为引导器来调整目标大模型的推理；进一步开发ThinkLogit-DPO，通过偏好优化训练引导模型。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO分别实现平均准确率相对提升24.5%和29.1%，使用21倍小的引导模型有效提升大模型性能。

Conclusion: ThinkLogit方法有效且与模型家族无关，可与小模型的后训练方法正交使用，为无需昂贵后训练即可解锁大模型长推理能力提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了NL2GenSym框架，将大语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了SOAR手动编码规则的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，效率低下。大语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但缺乏实验验证。

Method: 采用执行驱动的生成器-批评器机制：LLM生成器基于检索增强生成访问自演进知识库提出规则，在SOAR环境中执行验证，批评器根据执行反馈迭代优化规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，生成规则成功率超过86%，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。小参数模型也能获得更好性能。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架有效实现了从自然语言到符号规则的自动生成，显著提升了SOAR系统的实用性和效率。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了医学领域大语言模型的微调机制，发现微调仅改变表示空间的子集，提出tuning vectors框架来捕捉参数变化方向，这些向量对提升指令遵循和生成质量至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，而对领域专业化LLM的微调机制理解不足，特别是医学领域大语言模型的微调如何重塑参数空间尚不明确。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架（受task vectors启发），显式捕捉微调引起的参数方向性变化，分析这些向量在不同模型层中的行为模式。

Result: 发现微调仅修改表示空间的子集，保持预训练模型表示；tuning vectors能提升指令遵循和生成质量，跨领域组合可改善泛化能力；这些向量主要在MLP层写入新方向信息，在注意力头中放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应提供了新见解，并为分析大语言模型专业化提供了通用可解释框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法面临链式思维中稀疏token奖励的挑战，当前方法依赖无差别的token级熵调整，常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃

Method: 提出TEPO框架，通过马尔可夫似然（序列似然）将组级奖励与token通过token级聚合关联

Result: TEPO在关键指标（包括@k和准确率）上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新SOTA并显著提升训练稳定性

Conclusion: TEPO框架有效解决了token级奖励稀疏性问题，为语言模型推理能力提升提供了更稳定的训练方法

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Motivation: 建立共享目标是人机通信的基础步骤，但自然语言歧义会导致看似正确但不符合说话者意图的输出，特别是在数据可视化领域。

Method: 开发了歧义类型分类法并提出量化指标，使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题验证，并探索了基于Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论和问题讨论框架的多轮对话策略。

Result: 歧义指标比不确定性基线更好地与人工标注相关，多轮对话能显著减少歧义并提高代码准确性。

Conclusion: 多轮对话在代码生成中具有重要价值，能有效减少歧义并更好地匹配用户目标。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

TL;DR: 提出了多尺度图思维链（MSGCOT）提示框架，将多尺度结构信息融入图提示学习，通过从粗到细的粒度动态整合多尺度信息，在少样本场景下显著优于现有单粒度图提示调优方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图提示调优方法局限于单粒度（节点级或子图级）提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性。

Method: 设计轻量级低秩粗化网络高效捕获多尺度结构特征作为分层基向量，模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程，在每个推理步骤动态整合多尺度信息，形成渐进式粗到细提示链。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 将多尺度信息整合到图提示学习中能有效提升模型性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，证明了多尺度图提示框架的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

TL;DR: LLM SELECTOR是首个用于大语言模型主动选择的框架，通过自适应选择少量信息量大的查询进行标注，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法需要完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂，需要开发更高效的模型选择方法。

Method: 使用自适应查询选择策略，结合基于评判者的标注模型，选择对模型区分最有信息量的查询进行标注。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，该方法在选择最佳和接近最佳模型时，标注成本降低高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR框架能有效降低LLM选择的标注成本，为实际应用提供了实用的模型选择方案。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLMs隐藏状态的各种实体表示中一致生成多标记提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多标记提及。

Result: LLMs开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多标记实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: 为研究LLMs内部实体表示提供了新证据和新方法，表明LLMs具有表示和操作多标记实体的能力。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Result: 完整口语对话输入在相似规模模型中性能最高，显著超越先前方法；注意力池化压缩方法在保持竞争力的准确性的同时减少了上下文大小。

Conclusion: 改进源于更有效的上下文利用，完整口语历史提供最佳性能，压缩方法提供了良好的权衡方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for
end-to-end Spoken Dialog State Tracking using Speech-LLMs. We systematically
evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模数据索引提供了实用方法，促进了向绿色计算的转型，并实现了以前无法实现的与越狱无关的LLM安全。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，通过神经和符号组件的协同交互实现稳健高效的推理。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 提出了多模态策略内化（MPI）任务，通过TriMPI三阶段训练框架将复杂多模态策略内化到模型参数中，实现无需推理时包含策略的强策略遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代对话系统依赖预定义策略，但随着系统扩展，这些策略变得复杂冗长，导致遵循困难且计算成本高。多模态策略管理仍未被充分研究。

Method: 提出TriMPI三阶段框架：1）通过持续预训练注入策略知识；2）监督微调；3）PolicyRollout强化学习扩展，在rollout中增强策略感知响应以进行基础探索。

Result: TriMPI在端到端准确性、泛化能力和抗遗忘鲁棒性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个关于多模态策略内化的工作，提供了数据集、训练方法和全面评估，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注数学和逻辑推理，而统计学作为一个独特且综合的学科在基准测试中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 设计了可扩展的多智能体流水线，结合人工验证，自动化大规模问题提取、重写和质量控制，确保学术严谨性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了无标签情况下估计NLP模型性能的方法，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据漂移或零样本基线方法能产生更可靠和一致的性能排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化时，无标签估计模型性能是一个重要目标，但现有方法在跨域性能排名可靠性方面仍不明确。

Method: 使用四类基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集的15个领域上进行两步评估实验。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型错误预测器与真实准确率的相关性更强且更一致，排名可靠性在领域间性能差异较大时更高，且错误模型预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时效果更好。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了性能估计方法何时可信，为跨域模型评估提供了使用指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过口音分类、掩码关键区域和数据增强来提高ASR模型对不同口音的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的基于transformer的ASR模型对英语和波斯语等语言中的口音和方言变化敏感，导致词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别并掩码对分类预测最关键的区域，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 在英语和波斯语实验中，该方法显著降低了Whisper模型的词错误率，并创建了首个波斯语多区域口音数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多语言ASR系统对口音和方言多样性的鲁棒性，为低资源语言研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset
are publicly available at: https://github.com/MH-Sameti/Accent_invariant_ASR

TL;DR: 提出了Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP)方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡大型推理模型的效率和准确性，解决过度思考问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法在减少token消耗时往往损害模型性能，因为token级监督过于简单，需要更细粒度的监督来平衡效率和准确性。

Method: 设计了GRSP方法，基于推理步骤段进行惩罚，采用长度感知的权重机制跨段簇进行监督，利用推理段与token消耗和模型性能的强相关性。

Result: 实验表明GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提升token效率，特别是在困难问题上优势明显，同时稳定了RL训练并在不同模型规模上有效扩展。

Conclusion: GRSP通过步骤级监督有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在效率和准确性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了18个开源LLM在5个下游任务中的抗错能力，发现拼写错误会显著降低模型性能，特别是在生成性和推理任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设输入干净，而真实应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，LLM在多语言环境下的抗错鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 开发了基于语言特定键盘布局和打字行为的MulTypo多语言拼写错误生成算法，评估了3个模型家族的18个开源LLM在语言推理、多选问答、数学推理和机器翻译等5个任务上的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，生成性任务和推理任务受影响最严重；指令调优提高了干净输入性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒；从英语翻译比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究强调了噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估的必要性，并公开了代码和数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型因其并行解码能力而成为自回归模型的高效替代品，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务奖励的对齐。现有方法使用ELBO等替代目标会引入显著的策略梯度偏差。

Method: 提出Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比基于ELBO或一步估计的基线方法更加准确。

Result: SPG在多个任务上显著优于基线方法：在GSM8K上准确率提升3.6%，MATH500提升2.6%，Countdown提升18.4%，Sudoku提升27.0%。

Conclusion: SPG方法通过使用对数似然的上下界，有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个推理任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 扩散大语言模型(DLLMs)在并行解码时面临并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)，导致其在复杂推理任务中回归自回归行为，限制了推理深度和自反思维能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DLLMs在并行解码和因果推理顺序之间的内在冲突，识别并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过行为分析研究DLLMs在不同难度任务中的表现，引入三个扩展维度(并行、扩散、顺序)，并提出缓解策略。

Result: DLLMs仅在可直接判定的输出中展现真正并行性；任务难度增加时回归自回归行为；自回归提示使解码步骤几乎翻倍但质量未提升。

Conclusion: PSC限制了DLLMs的自我反思、推理深度和探索广度，建议采用并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

Motivation: 解决多语言医学视频档案中检索相关教学视频的挑战，现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗糙嵌入，要么细粒度匹配成本过高，需要平衡检索精度和效率。

Method: 将视频字幕分为语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建层次化树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入。查询时进行粗到细树搜索剪枝，仅对排名靠前的块用轻量级LLM重评分。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进性能，消融研究证实知识图谱增强、层次化索引和针对性LLM重排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型越来越多地使用思维链推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间步骤（即思维轨迹）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究评估了三个维度：1) 测量语言遵从性、答案准确性和一致性；2) 通过跨语言交换思维轨迹评估一致性；3) 使用截断和错误注入等扰动技术探测思维轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 研究发现模型对语言有强烈偏好，不同语言间性能差异明显；思维轨迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对思维轨迹的依赖程度各不相同。

Conclusion: 多语言思维链推理在不同语言间存在显著差异，模型的推理轨迹质量和有效性受到提示语言的强烈影响，这为未来多语言推理研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI代理在数学和编程领域表现出色，但在长时程交互任务中表现不佳，需要像人类认知中的"替代性试错"能力来模拟未来可能情况。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1) ReSim通过环境交互构建搜索树，训练代理生成结构化推理轨迹；2) Dyna-GRPO使用在线强化学习，结合结果奖励和中间状态反馈来增强模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld基准测试中，ReSim有效提升了代理的模拟能力，Dyna-GRPO能够学习到更好的长时程规划策略。

Conclusion: 模拟能力对于AI代理在复杂环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动具有核心作用。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Method: 构建了包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估了17个不同规模和训练方式的语言模型在新实体推理任务中的表现。

Result: 调整语言模型以显示推理行为能显著提升大多数连接词类型的表现，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上表现都较差。

Conclusion: 话语连接词可以作为语言模型理解世界知识的重要线索，为深入研究语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS)框架，通过双脑架构实现实时口语语言模型的高保真推理，显著降低延迟同时保持推理质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时口语语言模型无法有效利用链式思维推理的问题，因为顺序生成整个思维过程会产生不可接受的延迟

Method: 采用受大脑启发的双脑方法："构思大脑"负责高层推理来引导"表达大脑"进行流畅语音生成，消除模式切换

Result: 在数学推理任务Spoken-MQA上达到92.8%准确率，在语音对话任务URO-Bench上获得82.5分，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，实现了类似人类"边思考边说话"的能力

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

*Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-TTS是一种推理时数据增强策略，仅使用90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变指令提示强度来合成多样化的推理轨迹上下文，从而增强LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量人工标注的推理数据集，成本高昂且资源密集。P-TTS旨在通过最小化标注开销来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用仅90个手动选择的推理实例，通过系统化改变指令提示强度在测试时合成多样化的推理轨迹上下文，然后对Qwen-2.5模型进行微调。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，P-TTS-7B和32B模型显著优于现有基线，在AIME'24和AIME'25上分别获得最高+30.00%和+26.63%的绝对准确率提升，并在零样本泛化测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: P-TTS提供了一种实用、低成本的解决方案，有效探索推理模式的潜在空间，在资源受限或快速发展的领域中释放LLM的推理潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AScience框架和ASCollab系统，使用LLM研究代理进行大规模科学假设探索，通过社交网络动态积累高质量、多样化的发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无约束的探索性发现创造了机会，但传统方法难以有效处理这种假设空间的累积搜索过程。

Method: 开发AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验表明这种社交动态能够在多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路以及提出新的治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验证明，具有社交结构的代理网络能够大规模持续进行探索性假设搜索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型(LLMs)来评估车辆路径规划(VRP)生成的配送路线，以解决印度电商物流中地址不规范、地图不完整等问题，提高配送效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在真实场景中因地址不规范、地图不完整和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发了一个框架，利用LLMs根据政策标准对VRP生成的路线进行批判性评估，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。

Result: 开源LLMs识别路由问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高可达86%。LLM评估VRP路线可超越传统的距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的VRP路线评估是一种有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM是一个统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉预测和导航规划整合到单一多模态自回归主干中，显著提升了视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架确保预测与控制紧密对齐。

Method: 提出UniWM统一模型，集成视觉预测和规划于单一多模态自回归主干，采用分层记忆机制结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文。

Result: 在四个基准测试中导航成功率提升高达30%，显著减少轨迹误差，并在未见的TartanDrive数据集上展示出色的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要步骤，证明了统一世界模型在视觉导航中的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法，最差性能提升约28倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的启发式设计方法存在性能不稳定的问题，需要更系统的方法来提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 采用三种简单策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间特定区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch具有约28倍的最差性能提升，平均性能也有所改进，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地向LLM提供反馈和专门化设计，可以有效提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决LLM智能体在长时程任务中上下文管理的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务中，LLM智能体的小错误会累积，且模型容易产生幻觉或失去连贯性。上下文管理成为核心瓶颈，导致智能体忽略关键证据或被无关信息干扰，无法重新规划或从错误中反思。

Method: COMPASS框架包含三个专门组件：(1)主智能体执行推理和工具使用；(2)元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预；(3)上下文管理器为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个挑战性基准测试中，COMPASS相比单智能体和多智能体基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了LLM智能体在长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练流程进一步提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [209] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI在评估文学风格时都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在，表明AI在训练中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是测量评估者之间的归因偏见。

Method: 采用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验。研究1比较人类参与者（N=556）和AI模型（N=13）在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注三种条件下评估文学段落。研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者间的泛化性。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。研究2证实这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点）。归因标签导致评估者颠倒评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的偏见倾向。这是首次在美学判断中对人类和人工评估者归因偏见进行的对照比较。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行整个操作循环中的表现，覆盖各种失败模式。

Method: 基于目标-计划-行动循环构建评估框架，包含目标实现、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循5个指标，使用LLM评判器进行自动评估。

Result: 在TRAIL/GAIA和内部数据集上测试，能覆盖所有智能体错误，LLM评判器与人工标注一致性达80%-95%，错误定位一致性达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统方法，能有效识别和定位各种失败模式，支持智能体性能的针对性改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接受/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同行评审存在不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，需要AI辅助来提供系统性和一致的评估。

Method: 开发了ReviewerToo框架，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可以部分或完全集成到真实会议工作流程中，使用gpt-oss-120b模型进行实验。

Result: AI评审员在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有困难；AI生成的评审在质量上高于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家。

Conclusion: AI可以增强同行评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家；提出了将AI集成到同行评审流程的指南，为混合评审系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的对齐中，通过构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励来优化模型与用户的交互，提高推理效率和答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中模型可能过度解释或生成冗长推理，导致用户不满。这类似于囚徒困境，需要一种互利决策机制。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还包含基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign在多样化任务中显著提升了推理效率、答案质量和互惠福利，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的互惠问题，实现了模型与用户的双赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能表现。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同角色以确保公平比较，通过解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步动作。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可重现且客观的评估框架，能够评估LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和吸引力的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

TL;DR: RADAR框架通过机制可解释性检测LLM数据污染，区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应，准确率达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不可靠，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高性能。

Method: 提取37个特征（表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性），使用集成分类器训练这些特征来区分记忆与推理。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例完美表现，挑战性模糊案例76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有潜力推动LLM评估超越传统表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

*Samuel Hildebrand,Curtis Taylor,Sean Oesch,James M Ghawaly Jr,Amir Sadovnik,Ryan Shivers,Brandon Schreiber,Kevin Kurian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估RAG管道的基准，包含93个多模态问题，评估管道的文本、表格、图像处理能力，并引入了短语级召回指标和幻觉检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是多模态信息的处理能力。

Method: 创建包含文本、表格、图像的多模态数据集，使用短语级召回指标评估正确性，采用最近邻嵌入分类器检测幻觉，比较开源和闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上表现差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的整体能力，闭源模型在多模态信息处理方面具有明显优势，提出的评估指标与人类判断有良好一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据减少94%的token消耗，使用多跳关联检索和动态关系推理，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制。

Method: 索引阶段仅提取存储核心实体和元数据；检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，将平均精确匹配分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 验证了实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

*Jinxin Shi,Zongsheng Cao,Runmin Ma,Yusong Hu,Jie Zhou,Xin Li,Lei Bai,Liang He,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。每个图都有层原生相关性函数，并通过熵门控规则在日志空间中融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上表现优异，使用InternAgent日志文件时，HLE准确率提升7.7%，GPQA提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重建答案，作为深度研究系统的补充具有良好效果。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取知识图谱的语义条件，并自适应地融合到文本嵌入中，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如prefix-tuning只是简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的关系语义，并给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用GNN从局部图邻域提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应地调制文本嵌入。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

*Qixiang Yin,Huanjin Yao,Jianghao Chen,Jiaxing Huang,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级的3B多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快推理和更高准确率，统一了多任务多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型规模大、过度思考、轻量场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，优先简洁高质量响应；第二阶段提出AMM模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化减少冲突。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试中表现出色，涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力等多个领域。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V使轻量级模型能够在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色，解决了现有MLLMs的推理效率问题。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Yincen Qu,Huan Xiao,Feng Li,Hui Zhou,Xiangying Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的旅行规划基准，通过单一奖励整合细粒度标准，支持强化学习集成，并在大规模数据集上验证了RL方法在提升行程可行性方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估旅行规划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力方面存在不足，需要更全面的评估框架来直接比较规划质量和支持强化学习。

Method: 开发了包含4,870个查询的大规模数据集，构建了统一的奖励评估器，并测试了多种方法包括测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家标注达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM作为评判的基线。强化学习方法在基础模型上普遍提高了行程可行性，获得了更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，强化学习方法在提升规划可行性方面表现优异，为旅行规划系统的开发提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在证明评分方面的能力，发现模型能可靠识别错误证明但存在部分分数分配校准问题，提出了基于代理工作流的自动评分方法，显著提高了与人工评分的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在奥林匹克数学问题解决方面的显著进步，需要评估这些模型在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平分数分配，而不仅仅是二元正确性判断。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解决方案集，引入代理工作流来提取和分析参考解决方案，自动推导问题特定的评分标准，实现多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误（包括细微错误）解决方案，但在部分分数分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流在注释语料库和MathArena上实现了更高的人类评分一致性和更一致的部分分数处理。

Conclusion: 代理工作流方法显著提高了证明评分的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，结合符号方法和LLM来修复正则表达式ReDoS漏洞，解决了现有方法在精度和泛化性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但存在ReDoS漏洞。现有修复方法面临权衡：符号方法精确但无法处理复杂模式，LLM泛化性好但可靠性不足。

Method: 采用混合框架LRR：首先用符号模块定位漏洞子模式，然后调用LLM生成语义等效的修复方案，实现问题识别与修复过程的解耦。

Result: 该框架成功解决了规则方法无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比现有最优方法提高了15.4%。

Conclusion: LRR提供了一种经过验证的方法论，有效结合了符号方法的可靠性和LLM的泛化能力，为自动化修复问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，通过VLM编码GUI轨迹为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留细粒度视觉信息，在长序列任务和分布偏移下提升GUI代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本token，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨界面和长序列任务的泛化能力。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长序列和分布偏移下持续提升成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理的泛化能力，通过低成本数据收集和仅微调记忆编码器（1.2%参数）即可实现显著性能提升，为GUI自动化提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种整合精神分析和MBTI人格理论的方法来构建人工智能意识系统，开发了三种人工意识（自我意识、无意识、前意识）和16种MBTI人格角色，通过多种评估方法验证了模型模拟人类认知的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然在各领域取得显著进展，但由于存在幻觉问题，难以真正模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合心理学理论来构建更接近人类认知的人工智能系统。

Method: 基于精神分析理论开发三种人工意识模块，结合MBTI人格类型设计16种不同性格的角色，创建10种情境测试模型在情感理解、逻辑思维等7个属性上的表现，采用问卷调查、ChatGPT分类和定性评估三种方法进行分析。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明模型能够较好地模拟人类意识，尽管不同角色和意识类型之间的响应差异不够显著。

Conclusion: 整合精神分析和人格理论元素开发的模型能够构建更直观、适应性更强的人工智能系统，为改善AI在复杂认知情境中的交互能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: 提出了MEC³O多专家共识系统，通过将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，结合加权共识机制来预测代码时间复杂度，在CodeComplex数据集上显著优于开源基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在代码时间复杂度预测任务中，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，不同模型在不同类别上各有优势。

Method: MEC³O多专家共识系统：基于模型性能将LLMs分配到不同复杂度类别，提供类别专业化指令使其成为专家；专家参与结构化辩论，通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%；在macro-F1分数上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini达到竞争性水平。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，使基于流的文本到图像模型具有多样性感知能力，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来提升生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩散，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，这种扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束允许在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下提升变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持图像质量和对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法理论上显示单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，这为生成质量稳健保持提供了原理性解释。该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Method: 引入动态超图学习捕获复杂网络中的高阶非成对关系；提出物理数据双驱动动态预测模块，结合Koopman算子理论将非线性动力学微分方程转化为线性系统求解，并利用物理信息神经微分方程确保动态演化符合物理规律。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建产业链网络数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法具有良好的预测准确性和长期预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态超图学习和双驱动预测模块，有效解决了复杂网络动态预测中高阶关系建模和可解释性问题，实现了准确且可解释的长期动态预测。

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出强化学习框架训练LLM智能体在社交推理游戏中优化说服性沟通，通过将对话建模为Stackelberg竞争来影响其他玩家的信念和响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注信息处理和策略选择，忽视了说服性沟通在影响其他玩家信念和响应方面的重要性。在社交推理游戏中，成功不仅取决于正确推理，还需要说服他人按照自己的意图行动。

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者的响应。基于此理论框架，提出强化学习框架训练智能体优化话语以获得说服效果。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行全面实验，证明该方法显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

TL;DR: 提出PAC推理方法，通过置信上界控制性能损失，在用户指定的性能损失容忍度内动态切换思考与非思考模式以节省计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂问题解决中表现出色，但部署时计算成本高。现有的动态切换方法存在额外推理错误且缺乏性能损失统计保证，不适合高风险应用。

Method: 构建性能损失的单调置信上界函数，基于不确定性评分确定切换阈值，在分布无关情况下确保有界性能损失。

Result: 在推理基准测试中，该方法能节省计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失。

Conclusion: PAC推理方法为高效推理提供了统计保证，在高风险应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在生成医疗建议时存在系统性偏见，不同社会群体（特别是原住民和双性人患者）收到的建议可读性较差且更复杂，这种趋势在交叉群体中更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否考虑医疗的社会性质，特别是健康差异和社会偏见如何影响LLM生成的医疗建议。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）询问一系列医学问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异趋势更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对这些模型的信任度增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保公平的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但PSPACE完全问题能更严格地评估计算能力，因为其解决方案需要探索巨大的搜索空间。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建了包含超过100万个正则表达式实例的标注数据集，并使用严格过滤过程建立基准，对6个LLM和5个LRM进行了广泛评估。

Result: 评估揭示了模型在PSPACE完全正则表达式问题上的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，表明当前模型在空间计算能力方面存在显著限制。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对LLM和LRM的空间计算限制进行了实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过整合感知、推理、记忆和执行系统，可以构建能够模仿人类认知过程、具备自主智能行为的智能体，有效提升大语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，通过可调节的局部性参数在训练和推理时动态控制语言模型的内部表示，从局部化（可解释、基于规则）到分布式（泛化性强、高效）编码之间连续调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在需要透明度和能力的受监管领域中，难以同时满足可解释性和高性能的问题。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚注意力机制、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过数学证明建立明确的阈值条件。

Result: 证明当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型解决逻辑推理问题的内部机制，目前这些机制在很大程度上尚未被研究。

Method: 使用小型语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，特别关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现归纳头在逻辑推理所需的规则补全和规则链接步骤中发挥核心作用。

Conclusion: 语言模型可以通过学习底层规则而非统计模式来解决逻辑推理问题，归纳头是实现这一能力的关键机制。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Motivation: 传统约束编程中基于后继变量的模型无法有效处理可选访问和插入启发式算法，这限制了在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，实现了底层数据结构，并设计了专门用于序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Conclusion: 序列变量为约束编程中的车辆路径问题提供了更直观和灵活的建模框架，能够有效处理可选访问和插入启发式算法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的智能体系统为放射学工作流程自动化提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要进一步研究解决实际部署中的技术和管理挑战。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,

and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱，解决了神经符号AI的可扩展性和可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号AI框架难以扩展，神经方法的隐式表示和近似推理限制了可解释性和可信度。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠的知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个微小的图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱，形成模块化的神经符号堆栈。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实分数和68.8%的有效性分数，显著优于32B参数LLM基线的40.2%事实分数和43.0%有效性分数。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在缺乏高难度问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API限制可访问性等问题，需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 从72个不同地区的官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的题目，每个题目配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，表现强劲但仍不及顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位），而开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位，显示与前沿闭源模型存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先进行精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for
controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation.
However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming,
computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a
significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid
simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN).
We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem
and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates.
The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both
geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach
replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense
grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%,
leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross
modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage
overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework
for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by
textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based
on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape
features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with
parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a
corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original
surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of
parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer
Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369,
with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is
particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.

TL;DR: 该课程探讨了MCMC方法在生成式AI和基于物理的渲染中的重要作用，旨在建立一个统一框架来连接这两个研究领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在视觉语言模型方面取得了前所未有的进展，但缺乏一个连接基于物理的渲染和扩散生成模型的统一框架。MCMC方法在这两个领域都发挥着关键作用，可以作为桥梁连接这些相关研究领域。

Method: 通过课程形式，提供必要的理论和实践工具，包括Jupyter笔记本演示，帮助学生、研究人员和从业者理解MCMC在生成式AI和基于物理的渲染中的应用。

Result: 开发了一个教程课程，展示了MCMC如何作为桥梁连接生成式AI和基于物理的渲染，提供了相关演示材料和资源。

Conclusion: MCMC方法有潜力成为连接生成式AI和基于物理的渲染的关键桥梁，该课程为这一目标提供了初步的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in
vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process,
new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional
distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly
effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions.
This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring
accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The
update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update
depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter
space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based
optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important
role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise
quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples
(images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven
manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still
missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of
these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge,
linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide
necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and
practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

*Bram Kraaijeveld,Andrei C. Jalba,Anna Vilanova,Maxime Chamberland*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于体素的实时光线追踪框架，用于渲染大规模动态线集，支持环境光遮蔽和物理精确的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态线集的实时渲染在许多可视化任务中很重要，但高质量的全局光照和透明度在交互速率下仍然难以实现。

Method: 开发了支持体素锥追踪和光线追踪加速结构的高效体素化算法，以及基于体素的剔除方法限制加速结构构建到相机可见的体素。

Result: 该方法在渲染（半）不透明动态线集时，在质量和性能上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了大规模动态线集的高质量实时渲染，具有物理精确的透明度效果。

Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization
tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter
reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global
illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure
of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We
propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large
dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The
framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient
construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray
tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a
voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction
to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality,
real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate
transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art
in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段高斯泼溅框架，通过显式分离和优化前景与背景区域，提升户外场景重建质量，特别改善了低细节背景区域的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外场景重建面临挑战，因为前景纹理丰富区域与低细节、光照不均的远距离背景形成鲜明对比，传统方法难以同时处理好这两类区域。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段在球形壳内初始化背景基元，使用结合背景光度损失和几何正则化的损失函数进行优化；第二阶段初始化前景高斯，使用标准渲染损失进行细化，背景保持固定。

Result: 在多样化户外数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了背景伪影，提高了感知质量，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式的背景分离支持自动、无物体的环境图估计，为逼真的户外渲染和混合现实应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast
between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low
detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian
Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions,
yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background
primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss
that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric
regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and
another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground
Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added
and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains
fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse
outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves
perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the
explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map
estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and
mixed-reality applications.

*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Energy-Driven Steering (EDS)框架，通过基于能量的模型在推理时动态引导LLM隐藏状态，在保持安全性的同时显著降低错误拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往过度谨慎，导致对良性提示的错误拒绝。需要同时提升安全性和减少错误拒绝。

Method: 训练轻量级外部能量模型，在推理时根据LLM内部激活映射到能量景观，通过能量梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域。

Result: 在ORB-H基准上，将合规率从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效范式，可构建同时具有低错误拒绝率和高安全性的LLM。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个轻量级诊断工具包，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的输出不稳定性问题，如RAG重排序、微调、提示路径等导致的答案翻转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在输出不稳定问题：RAG输出随段落重排序而翻转、微调削弱预训练学到的恒定性、辩论或思维链提示的路径依赖性等。这些违反预期不变性的问题会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON通过简单的循环和重排序检查内部表示来生成系统信号，结合无逆曲率映射（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）和激活级交换子来标记重排序风险。

Result: WILSON信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，可输出阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用，帮助防护RAG的顺序效应、捕获微调回归、稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文。

Conclusion: WILSON能够预测故障并批准安全优化，使可靠性和吞吐量在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下共同提升。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

TL;DR: RareNet是一种基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据即可识别最可能的致病基因，为罕见遗传病诊断提供可解释的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，特别是在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别致病基因，并检索相关的患者子图用于临床调查。该方法可作为独立工具或与其他候选基因优先级排序方法结合使用。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的弱势群体提供了可及性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Result: 该框架通过有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，在动态环境中提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的边缘资源管理框架能够应对边缘环境中的资源约束和干扰，实现可靠的3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，导致分布偏移问题。现有实例归一化方法未能解决单个实例内部的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出两种点级方法：LD通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入输出分布来消除内部差异；LCD利用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，这两种方法与各种骨干模型结合都表现出色，验证了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的内部实例分布偏移问题，为处理非平稳时间序列提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert是首个针对语言赋能基础模型的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器，有效解决了中毒攻击问题，为实际应用提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标（标准化应力和KL散度）对尺度变化的敏感性，提出了使这些指标尺度不变的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中，二维散点图是常用方法，但评估这些投影图的准确性具有挑战性。常用的质量指标如标准化应力和KL散度对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质性改变投影的性质。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度对应力和KL散度的影响，引入简单技术使这两个指标尺度不变，并在小型基准测试中验证其有效性。

Result: 研究表明应力和KL散度值会因尺度变化而显著改变，这影响了降维技术的评估。提出的尺度不变方法在基准测试中准确捕捉了预期行为。

Conclusion: 现有的可视化质量指标对尺度变化过于敏感，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估降维投影的质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，分别处理低频和高频特征，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现低频分量具有高相似性但连续性差，高频分量具有强连续性但相似性差，这启发了针对不同频率分量采用不同缓存策略。

Method: 提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)：直接重用低频分量特征（基于相似性），使用二阶Hermite插值器预测高频分量（基于连续性）。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)而非所有层特征，减少99%内存占用。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit等数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法在生成和编辑任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: FreqCa通过频域分析和针对性缓存策略，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.

*Yunzhen Feng,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn,Yaqi Duan,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法，通过置信度加权的惩罚机制利用负样本组，改进GRPO在强化学习中的效率问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在负样本组（无正确响应的组）中产生零优势，浪费计算资源，需要找到利用这些负样本的方法

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改后价值函数的策略梯度，为错误响应添加置信度加权的惩罚

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，LENS方法在Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-3B上持续优于GRPO基线，在困难项目上表现更佳

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性和实用的方法来'拯救'负样本组，提高了RLVR的效率和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳问题的理论研究和实际应用。本文旨在探索ICL在时变信道均衡中的潜力，为下一代无线基础模型提供更强的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效注意力机制，从自适应信号处理算法中汲取灵感，推导出基于LMS算法、LRMS公式和多步梯度更新的新型注意力变体。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，基于经典自适应算法的注意力机制显著提升了动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，基于自适应算法的注意力机制设计为开发具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的下一代无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance

TL;DR: 提出了反事实公平的共形预测方法，在保持边际覆盖率的同时确保预测集的反事实公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注点预测的反事实公平性，而预测集的公平性研究不足；共形预测虽然能提供有效的预测集，但不保证反事实公平性

Method: 通过对称化受保护属性干预的符合度分数，开发了反事实公平共形预测方法

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，达到目标覆盖率，且预测集大小仅有最小增加

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的路径来实现反事实公平的不确定性量化

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术虽然有效，但多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些向量和矩阵干预技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将该理论推广到深层多块Transformer，推导出将提示信息压缩为独立于token的思维向量和思维矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 提出的思维向量和思维矩阵为现有的向量和矩阵模型编辑技术提供了理论解释，并提供了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的计算方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为语言模型推理时干预技术建立了理论基础，揭示了文本输入与权重更新之间的数学联系，为更原则性的模型控制方法提供了指导。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据关系，但缺乏可解释性，使其在高风险场景中不可靠。需要开发能够解释模型预测过程的方法。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，将获得相同预测且预测原因相似的样本分组。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了该方法的有效性，展示了不同样本获得相同预测的多种路径。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类提供了一种有效的方式来解释黑盒模型的预测过程，增强了模型的可信度和在高风险应用中的适用性。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖AutoML系统生成的复杂集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性

Method: 1) 训练LightGBM代理模型模拟AutoGluon预测，实现SHAP特征归因；2) 集成频谱可预测性分析，量化序列固有可预测性

Result: 在M5数据集上验证，频谱可预测性越高，预测精度和代理模型忠实度越高；逐项归一化对生成有意义的SHAP解释至关重要

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进集成预测提供可解释的实例级解释，同时提供可预测性指标作为预测和解释的可靠性指示器

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子设计中上下文学习效果有限的问题，利用ChEMBL等数据库中的分子属性数据，但每个属性的标记数据稀缺。

Method: 开发演示条件扩散模型，使用少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成目标属性分子；采用节点对编码的分子分词器，节点数减少5.5倍；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练7亿参数模型。

Result: 在6个类别的33个设计任务中，DemoDiff匹配或超越大100-1000倍的语言模型，平均排名为3.63，优于领域特定方法的5.25-10.20。

Conclusion: DemoDiff可作为分子设计的上下文学习基础模型，在分子生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Motivation: 现有方法在处理混合类型表格数据时存在语义信息丢失和缺乏可解释性的问题，在网络安全、金融欺诈检测和医疗等高风险领域需要更有效的异常检测方案。

Method: 将异常检测重构为特征条件重建问题，为每个特征训练专门的随机森林模型，结合调整后的Gower距离进行单元级评分，并使用不确定性加权平均聚合为行级异常分数。

Conclusion: RFOD框架成功解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测中的语义保持和可解释性问题，在多个关键领域具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Result: 方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池储能操作中的金融风险应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能，同时保持可证明的风险保证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别适用于对尾部风险敏感的高风险应用，通过端到端训练显著优于传统后处理方法。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的更微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出了一个量化FL中客户端内和客户端间记忆化的框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量方法，并研究了影响记忆化的关键因素。

Result: 发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化程度受训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: 联邦学习存在记忆化风险，特别是客户端内数据更容易被记忆，需要关注训练和推理策略对记忆化的影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化目标优化具有挑战性，因为量化器是分段常数函数，梯度在大部分区域为零，在量化阈值处未定义。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 采用Nesterov平滑思想，用连续损失面近似量化损失面。LOTION框架通过无偏随机舍入噪声的期望替换原始量化损失，使用随机舍入噪声时能保持原始量化损失的全局最小值。

Result: 在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上的实验表明，该方法优于标准QAT方法。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的平滑框架，能有效解决量化优化问题，并在实际任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、空气污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个而忽略另一个。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用带有空间先验的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学领域的真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder持续改进了效应估计，扩展了空间混杂基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了将虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合用于CT协议管理的潜力，具有灵活性，可适应不同的图像质量目标。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

*Francisco Pascoa,Ian Lalonde,Alexandre Girard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于白金汉π定理的零样本迁移方法，通过无量纲缩放实现强化学习策略在不同机器人、任务和环境间的泛化，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习策略在面临新的机器人、任务或具有不同物理参数的环境时往往难以泛化，这限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 利用白金汉π定理，将预训练策略的输入（观测）和输出（动作）通过无量纲空间进行缩放，实现零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中验证：模拟钟摆、物理钟摆（sim-to-real验证）和高维HalfCheetah。缩放迁移在动态相似情境下无性能损失，在非相似情境下始终优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强强化学习策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大而实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

*Shikun Liu,Haoyu Wang,Mufei Li,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在LLM内部编码过程中直接整合结构信息的新范式，通过顺序拼接和并行缓存两种方法生成结构感知的文本嵌入，在多个任务中优于纯文本和后处理基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了超链接、引用等丰富的结构信息，而这些结构在许多现实数据集中提供了关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种内部处理方法：顺序拼接和并行缓存。还引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线。顺序拼接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种将LLM生成的动作建议通过增强观察空间提供给RL代理的框架，允许代理学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升RL训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL代理在稀疏奖励环境中难以发现有效动作序列，而LLM具备程序性知识和推理能力，可以指导RL探索，但现有方法存在刚性依赖问题。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，让RL代理学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中，LLM指导的效益随任务难度增加而提升。在最复杂环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍，且无需修改现有RL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，展示了LLM指导在稀疏奖励RL问题中的实用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三大挑战：(i)每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后将学习到的参数用于初始化复杂目标函数的网络。引入域映射机制将任意域输入变换到参考域，保持与预训练模型的结构对应性。

Result: 在一维和二维设置下的广泛数值实验显示，在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经网络函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能根据公共次优性差距自适应调整探索策略，数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的物理信息深度算子框架，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子，相比PI-DeepONet在Burgers方程上减少了约48%的平均相对L2误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，并允许在训练后对参数化时间相关PDE进行快速预测的框架。

Method: 采用DeepONet风格的分支-主干架构，其子网络实例化为有理KAN模块，并通过PDE残差（PINN风格）损失来强制物理一致性。

Result: 在ν=0.01的Burgers方程上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet减少了约48%的平均相对L2误差，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中达到了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN在具有挑战性的基准问题上展示了准确的算子学习能力，结果与高保真解高度匹配。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Result: 提供了TAPAS数据集的创建文档，建立了攻击性能基准，并为未来工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集填补了AI研究LWE攻击的数据空白，有望加速该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略并假设模态输入始终可靠，这在真实学习环境中很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法来处理缺失或噪声模态。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块用于动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步的模态分配置信度权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测确保时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI教育子集上评估，针对困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧情绪，达到最先进性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情绪转换并自适应优先处理可靠信号，非常适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 需要开发更稳健、公平的预后模型，采用整体性方法针对所有形式的偏见，特别是在分布偏移情况下。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)与负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐关系，证明在共享随机性的条件下，两者的表示相似性矩阵保持接近，而参数空间则可能发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但缺乏对两者在表示层面是否对齐的研究。本文旨在回答CL和NSCL是否在训练过程中保持表示对齐这一开放性问题。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析其表示相似性矩阵的接近程度，并提供关于CKA和RSA等对齐度量的高概率保证。同时证明参数空间耦合的不稳定性。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，CL和NSCL的表示对齐随着类别数增加、温度升高而增强，但参数空间可能随时间呈指数级发散。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的理论桥梁，CL-NSCL表示对齐随规模扩展而增强，这为理解自监督学习提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为

Method: ATM方法动态调整特征选择，跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Result: 发现各视觉通路具有不同的成分响应特征：腹侧通路对脸、地点、身体、文字和食物敏感；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含运动和手部动作敏感；背侧通路包含一些难以解释的成分。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧和外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法能够以更高分辨率揭示大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐差异，提供对系统潜在神经调谐轴敏感的测量方法。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的CNN框架在多模态子空间聚类中表现优异，不同融合策略各有优势，为多模态数据分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Conclusion: BPMI在固定计算预算下实现了更高的预测精度，为多保真度模拟预算分配提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Dig-DEC，一种基于信息增益的无模型决策估计系数，用于解决结构化观测决策问题。该方法消除了乐观主义，在对抗性环境中表现更好，并在混合MDP中获得了首个无模型遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境，且存在遗憾界差距。需要一种更通用的方法来处理对抗性奖励和随机转移的混合环境。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，无需乐观主义。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个无模型遗憾界。改进了估计器，将遗憾界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线策略），从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线策略）。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，将遗憾界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC提供了一种更通用和高效的决策方法，能够处理对抗性环境，填补了现有方法的空白，并在多个场景中实现了与乐观方法相匹配的性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励方法在平衡探索与利用方面存在困难，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能

Method: 引入基于归因的贡献策略优化(ACPO)框架，包含轨迹语义分割、基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，以及因子化奖励系统来精确量化每个推理步骤的层次贡献

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等挑战性基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索和利用的平衡，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖的频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，证明了UCB算法中的置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时间域和累积遗憾角度出发，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好地理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，其不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器，并证明UCB算法在频域中的等价性。

Result: 证明了置信区间项在频域中等效于时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界限。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Motivation: 解决车联网中半持续调度(SPS)因数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关的信道不确定性导致的信息年龄(AoI)恶化问题。

Method: 建立了受车辆速度、车辆密度和资源预留间隔(RRI)影响的AoI计算模型，设计了双路径优化方案：DDPG通过状态空间和奖励函数进行指导，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后能实现更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的双路径优化方法能有效解决车联网中的AoI问题，LLM具有快速部署优势，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对小型地球数据的时空预测方法，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型，在不同场景下实现准确预测，优于传统深度学习和基础模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型虽然无需特定训练，但存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差。小型地球数据具有有限的短期监测变异性和时空相关性，需要更稳健的预测方法。

Method: 通过表征和量化小型地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨不同场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三个典型场景的比较结果显示，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更优越的准确性和更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为时空相关的小型地球数据预测提供了一种简单而稳健的解决方案，能够有效克服传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题和复杂偏微分方程时的局限性，特别是静态域分解方法需要大量超参数调优且容易陷入局部最优的问题。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态调整域分解：现有子域自适应调整以捕捉解的特征，同时在残差损失高的区域引入新的子域，为难以表示的解区域提供额外的表达能力。

Result: 综合数值结果表明，AB-PINNs在解决各种复杂多尺度偏微分方程方面表现出色，能够有效捕捉不同尺度的解特征。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适合多尺度问题，能够防止收敛到不希望的局部最小值，并减少对超参数调优的需求。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段优化，忽视了推理阶段的优化机会。不常见的特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出

Method: 使用分层概率哈希方法估计特征组合的出现频率作为置信度分数，以置信度为采样概率生成多个实例特定的推理路径，聚合多个路径的预测分数进行鲁棒预测

Result: 广泛的离线实验和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化显著提升预测性能

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统证据深度学习方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布中适应性不足，导致高风险决策任务中的校准和泛化性能较差。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数，外层通过策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果显示MPC显著提高了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，在不确定性校准、预测准确性和基于置信度的样本剔除后性能保持方面均有改进。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态调整不确定性建模参数，有效提升了模型在动态环境中的适应性和可靠性，优于传统的固定先验方法。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，展示了其作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Conclusion: 数据为中心的质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索学习优化器是否能够学习正则化效果，而不是依赖显式正则化技术来提升泛化能力和收敛性。

Method: 通过标准基准测试（MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR数据集和MLP、MLP-Relu、CNN网络）进行广泛实验，比较有/无显式正则化的学习优化器性能。

Result: 正则化学习优化器在测试准确率和泛化能力方面始终优于未正则化版本，并能将正则化效果保留并迁移到新的优化任务中。

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够固有地学习正则化属性，挑战了显式优化目标正则化的传统必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

TL;DR: 本文提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型和自适应奖励插值与轨迹选择，解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签样本上实现了稳定的性能扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法受限于有限的标注样本，而RLIR方法虽然能在无标签设置下持续扩展，但存在性能不稳定和系统偏差问题，特别是模型倾向于高估其高置信度轨迹，导致奖励估计偏差和不稳定训练。

Method: 提出RLER方法：1）使用集成模型聚合多样性；2）自适应奖励插值；3）轨迹选择策略。通过三个偏差指标（ρ_noise、ρ_selfbias、ρ_symbias）来表征系统偏差。

Result: 实验显示RLER相比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定的性能扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效缓解了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签设置下接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: FedL2T是一个个性化的联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中数据异构性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量标记EEG数据，但数据获取困难且涉及隐私问题。现有联邦学习方法在异构客户端设置下性能不佳，需要解决跨患者变异性的挑战。

Method: 提出FedL2T框架，采用双教师知识蒸馏策略：每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习；使用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和中间特征表示；引入近端正则化项增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T持续优于最先进的FL方法，特别是在低标签条件下表现突出。模型收敛快速稳定，减少了通信轮次和相关开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了一个可靠且个性化的解决方案，在保护数据隐私的同时显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Constraints-of-Thought框架，通过将推理步骤表示为(意图,约束)对来引导蒙特卡洛树搜索，在复杂多步领域实现更高效、约束对齐的规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保计划与用户意图对齐并满足符号约束。

Method: 使用(意图,约束)对的结构化先验来压缩搜索空间并强制有效性，将Const-o-T集成到MCTS中，通过约束修剪不可行分支并引导探索。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域中，该方法优于基线，产生更高准确率和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-of-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLM能够进行更高效、约束对齐且领域适应性强的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

TL;DR: PlatformX是一个完全自动化的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，通过集成能量驱动的搜索空间、可迁移的核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统，显著降低了搜索开销，在移动平台上实现了比MobileNet-V2更优的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和跨不同硬件平台的可扩展性差，在实际部署中不实用。PlatformX旨在克服这些限制，实现完全自动化和可迁移的硬件感知神经架构搜索。

Method: PlatformX集成了四个关键组件：(1) 能量驱动的搜索空间，扩展了传统NAS设计；(2) 跨设备可迁移的核级能量预测器；(3) 平衡能量和准确性的帕累托多目标搜索算法；(4) 使用外部监控器自动进行高分辨率运行时能量分析的系统。

Conclusion: PlatformX提供了一个实用的硬件感知神经架构搜索解决方案，通过完全自动化和可迁移的设计，解决了现有方法在真实世界部署中的局限性，为边缘设备设计高效深度神经网络提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法单独使用权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不理想，需要统一框架同时优化两种压缩技术

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，采用高斯混合模型建模量化权重，实现低比特精度

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比现有方法获得更高压缩率且性能下降相当

Conclusion: SQS框架通过贝叶斯变分学习统一剪枝和量化，实现了更优的神经网络压缩效果

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在噪声遗忘数据集下的大语言模型遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号得以保留，遗忘过程仍能保持稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、经过合成重写或带有水印的，而现有遗忘方法假设访问干净、明确定义的遗忘数据样本，这引发了遗忘可靠性的质疑。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释来分析遗忘的稳健性。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动表现出惊人的稳健性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。关键语义组件在表面形式发生显著变化时仍保持一致的遗忘驱动作用。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了遗忘在噪声数据下的稳健性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端token现象（如注意力汇聚和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题的根源在于注意力与近零值状态token之间的相互强化机制。

Method: VGA引入基于值向量的数据依赖门控机制，直接调节注意力输出。通过理论梯度分析证明，用值状态自身函数进行门控比先前基于输入嵌入的方法更有效，能解耦值和注意力分数的更新。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇聚的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提升了模型性能、量化鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与值状态之间的循环，有效解决了Transformer中的极端token问题。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器来协调可瘦身模型的分布式推理，在异构硬件和动态运行时条件下实现效率与吞吐量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型优化，忽视了适应异构硬件和波动运行时条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器负责批处理兼容请求和管理实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例和批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比纯随机任务分配基线，Slim Scheduler可实现多种准确性和延迟权衡：在最瘦模型（70.3%准确率）下，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在更高准确率下也能实现平均延迟和能耗的总体减少。

Conclusion: 该混合调度框架有效平衡了效率和吞吐量，减少了特定硬件的过拟合，为动态神经网络调度提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型性能提升，计算需求激增导致能耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估硬件、算法和碳优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算近十年来著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的生命周期分析，考虑能源消耗和生产过程的影响。

Result: 显卡生产影响持续增加，模型训练能耗呈指数增长，即使采用位置转移等减排策略也无法抵消环境影响，存在明显的回弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模、质疑资源密集型训练的频次，并考虑硬件全生命周期影响而非仅使用阶段。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，通常使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法进行评估，无法真实反映防御的实际效果。

Method: 通过系统调整和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）来创建自适应攻击策略。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原始报告显示这些防御的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文所述的自适应攻击，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Motivation: 基于深度神经网络训练中各种优化器往往能找到接近全局最优解的实证观察，从收敛到任意点的假设出发，研究不同优化器的内在行为特性。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理进行理论分析，适用于一般半代数C²函数，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出两种增强特征值过滤的新算法。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出IGCARL方法，通过战略对抗攻击和约束强化学习提升自动驾驶系统的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习自动驾驶方法存在三个关键问题：对抗短视攻击、难以引发真正安全关键事件、训练不稳定和政策漂移

Method: IGCARL包含战略目标对抗器和鲁棒驾驶代理，对抗器执行战略协调多步攻击，代理在约束条件下学习鲁棒策略

Result: 实验显示IGCARL比现有方法成功率提高至少27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性

Conclusion: IGCARL能有效提升DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，解决现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 交通是温室气体排放的主要来源，需要向可持续替代方案如电动汽车转型。但充电基础设施的空间分布不均和利用率不规则对电网稳定性和投资规划构成挑战。

Method: 结合图卷积网络和时序架构的TW-GCN框架，利用真实交通流量、天气条件和美国最大EV基础设施公司提供的专有数据，捕捉空间依赖性和时间动态。

Result: 实验表明3小时中期预测在响应性和稳定性之间达到最佳平衡，1DCNN始终优于其他时序模型。区域分析显示东、中、西田纳西州的预测准确性存在差异，反映了站点密度、人口和本地需求变化对模型性能的影响。

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了将时间序列分割技术与异构集成方法结合，用于工业生产的异常检测。通过使用ChangeFinder等变点检测算法进行预分割，结合随机森林和XGBoost的异构集成，显著提升了异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业生产环境中，准确检测异常状态变化对预防故障至关重要。传统方法在时间序列数据中存在时间不确定性，需要改进异常检测的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 采用变点检测（特别是ChangeFinder算法）作为预分割步骤，然后使用异构集成方法（随机森林和XGBoost）进行异常检测。

Result: 通过分割预处理，AUC-ROC指标从0.8599（PCA和LSTM集成）显著提升至0.9760（随机森林和XGBoost集成），证明了分割技术减少时间模糊性的有效性。

Conclusion: 时间序列分割作为预处理步骤能有效提升异构集成方法的异常检测性能，未来将研究结合变点分析的特征加权来进一步优化早期异常检测。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

TL;DR: FLToP CTC是一种基于帧级token剪枝的CTC解码算法，通过动态剪除低概率token来显著降低计算和内存需求，同时保持WER性能几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC解码器在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，需要消耗高达90%的处理时间，效率低下。

Method: 采用帧级token剪枝策略，基于相对概率阈值动态消除每帧中的低概率token。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上实现10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。现有方法难以有效解码和解释生物信号，特别是在低资源设置下。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Conclusion: BioCodec提供了一个通用的生物信号标记化解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，适用于多种生物信号类型，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型训练中，动量被广泛使用但存储动量存在内存挑战，需要开发内存高效的优化器。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不需要完整动量，通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减轻性能损失。

Result: 经验验证表明，该方法在动量方面减少超过90%内存，同时保持从60M到1.5B各种语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF的效率和性能。结合二阶统计量的内存高效技术，可进一步减少优化器状态内存达95%，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省超过30%GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM是一种有效的内存高效优化器，能在显著减少内存占用的同时保持模型训练性能。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往牺牲了在干净数据上的准确性，需要一种能平衡自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性的方法。

Method: MemLoss利用先前训练周期生成的对抗样本（记忆对抗样本），在后续训练中重复使用这些样本来增强模型训练，实现自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性的平衡提升。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确性，同时保持了强大的对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemLoss通过有效利用历史对抗样本，成功实现了模型在自然准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的平衡改进，为对抗训练提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要基于数据记录的平均隐私风险来评估组隐私风险，这可能低估组隐私风险及其差异。同时，当前评估最坏情况隐私风险的方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入新的成员推断游戏来高效审计近似最坏情况隐私风险；改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地评估组隐私风险差异，并通过改进的DP-SGD算法有效提升差分隐私机器学习中的隐私保护公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Motivation: 研究在对抗性延迟反馈下的上下文多臂老虎机问题，因为现实世界中反馈往往不是即时到达的，而是存在各种延迟。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类；对于一般函数逼近，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机，并提出基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的新稳定性分析。

Result: 有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾界O(√(KTlog|Π|) + √(Dlog|Π|))；一般函数逼近下获得O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_maxDβ))，其中β≤log|F|时进一步简化为O(√(KTlog|F|) + √(d_maxDlog|F|))。

Conclusion: 论文为延迟反馈CMAB问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在一般函数逼近设置下获得的遗憾界与下界相差√d_max因子，为未来改进留下空间。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Conclusion: 证明了信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量是共线的，通过位置相关的温度调节场连接，并给出了该场的解析公式和估计方法。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时减少通用能力遗忘，并降低40%以上的训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在领域适应中的权衡问题：提升专业领域能力往往以牺牲通用能力为代价。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K token子集（包含黄金标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。MoClip优化器限制梯度动量旋转并应用arctan2重缩放。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

Result: 在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在QA任务中表现出更高的准确性和知识覆盖度

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识增强LLMs的覆盖和时效性问题，为动态知识管理提供了新思路

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准测试，比较了EHR数据表示方法（多变量时间序列、事件流、文本事件流），发现事件流模型表现最佳，并揭示了不同临床场景下特征选择策略的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于评估实践不一致，电子健康记录（EHR）中患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要系统性的基准测试来比较不同表示方法。

Method: 在两个临床数据集（MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT）上标准化数据整理和评估流程，评估了多种建模方法：时间序列的Transformers、MLP、LSTM、Retain；事件流的CLMBR和计数模型；文本流的8-200亿参数LLM，并分析基于数据缺失的特征剪枝影响。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最强，预训练模型CLMBR在少样本设置中样本效率高，而简单计数模型在数据充足时具有竞争力。特征选择策略需适应临床场景：剪枝稀疏特征改善ICU预测，保留稀疏特征对纵向任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床背景和数据制度选择EHR表示提供了实用指导，事件流是最有效的表示方法。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在树莓派5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了设备端训练的内存和计算瓶颈问题，为在资源受限设备上部署Transformer模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入研究Git Re-Basin这一新颖的模型合并方法，探索其实际效果和局限性。

Method: 提出分层模型合并方案，与标准MergeMany算法进行比较实验。

Result: 分层合并显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强对抗鲁棒性且参与模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原作者报告更严重。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin在增强鲁棒性方面有潜力，但实际性能损失需要更谨慎评估。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

TL;DR: 提出GCM框架，通过全局约束学习功能脑网络的高阶结构，在5个数据集上相比基线方法提升30.6%准确率并减少96.3%计算时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，无法捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担大且启发式，难以端到端学习网络结构

Method: GCM框架整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签），支持4个建模分辨率（样本/被试/组/项目）的功能脑网络结构学习

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个SOTA方法，相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%

Conclusion: 为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定基础

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中非确定性和不可重现性导致跨运行和平台的结果不一致，主要源于随机数生成和浮点计算。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致问题仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来确保浮点计算的确定性。

Result: RepDL实现了跨不同计算环境的确定性深度学习训练和推理，确保位级可重现性。

Conclusion: RepDL成功解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致问题，为研究社区提供了可靠的可重现性工具。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习旨在实现类似人类的持续学习能力，但其核心挑战灾难性遗忘的深层原因尚未被充分理解。本文旨在揭示灾难性遗忘的对抗性本质。

Method: 通过理论分析发现新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，这种对抗性对齐源于训练的低秩偏差。提出backGP方法来减少由反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法在梯度投影方法基础上平均减少10.8%的遗忘，提高12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘的本质是新任务训练对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，而backGP方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的提示优化方法仅限于文本领域，无法充分发挥多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出了多模态提示优化器(MPO)，通过保持对齐的联合优化更新，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频、分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: Flow Matching在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索能力，在未见场景中泛化能力差。在线优化FM策略存在梯度不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 使用简单的MLP学生策略进行环境探索和在线RL更新，通过基于教师FM模型的奖励模型提供专家分布信息，并用同一教师模型正则化学生策略行为。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过将FM的表达能力与简单MLP策略的在线学习优势结合，成功克服了FM策略在线交互的局限性，实现了高效稳定的策略学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Result: 初步实验表明该方法能保守地捕捉真实解释，包含冗余但一致捕获预测反应可行性所需的关键分子属性

Conclusion: 该方法为化学反应预测提供了有效的解释机制，能识别对预测结果至关重要的分子特征

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实证验证了方法的特性，展示了时间感知激励的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的时间感知数据共享框架能够公平奖励早期参与者，促进协作数据共享和机器学习。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会导致仿真效率低下，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种能保持精度同时显著加速仿真的方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，直接在损失函数中利用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，并解决了多解收敛问题。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差信息化的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时保证计算精度，为解决复杂系统仿真问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Conclusion: 该框架为快速发展的LLM生态系统提供了可访问的安全对齐解决方案，特别适合第三方利益相关者。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Method: 提出BBQ方法，使用贝叶斯Bradley-Terry模型显式建模评分者质量，通过期望最大化算法实现单调似然收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

TL;DR: 本文通过应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理到150M参数的Transformer模型，建立了迭代复杂度的实用上界，发现完整GN更新比现有优化器显著减少训练迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在加速LLM预训练过程中，使用计算效率高的二阶结构近似方法会损失多少性能，为大规模训练提供性能基准。

Method: 应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理到Transformer模型，并与精确的逐层GN预条件器进行比较。

Result: 完整GN更新比SOAP和Muon等强基线减少5.4倍训练迭代次数，逐层GN预条件器性能接近完整GN方法。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，逐层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益，当前近似方法与理想逐层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

TL;DR: 该论文通过动力学系统框架分析softmax、norm和线性注意力机制，将其表示为动力学系统并与状态空间模型(SSMs)进行频谱比较，发现特征值对序列模型性能有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然softmax注意力在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方案如SSMs的效率更高，但它们在信息处理方面的根本差异尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 使用动力学系统框架将不同注意力机制表示为动力学系统，通过分析特征值谱进行系统比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长程依赖建模的关键方面，揭示了与任务需求相符的频谱特征；架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能有对应影响。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解和改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性的度量标准。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法在情感识别中通常依赖启发式、数据驱动或模型驱动的难度定义，忽略了人类感知难度这一主观任务中的关键因素。

Method: CHUCKLE框架基于众包数据集中标注者的一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型也同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示，CHUCKLE使LSTM相对平均准确率提升6.56%，Transformer提升1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE框架通过感知驱动的课程学习，有效提升了情感识别模型的训练效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Motivation: 现有RL方法在任务难度超过模型能力时会出现奖励稀疏和训练低效问题，先前工作使用离策略数据但往往误导策略更新，核心问题是训练亲和力低。

Method: 引入Affinity指标监控探索效率和训练稳定性，提出HINT自适应提示框架，提供启发式提示而非直接答案来引导模型发现解决方案。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的广泛实验表明，HINT始终优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上实现最先进结果，同时展示更稳定的学习和更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过改善训练亲和力，有效解决了RL在复杂推理任务中的挑战，为增强LLM的长链推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计的经验成功，还为系统设计新序列模型架构提供了指导原则，连接了近期文献中的多个洞察和观察。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了权重初始化对神经网络训练的影响，包括ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer，发现了稳定的初始化标准差范围，验证了Kaiming初始化的优越性，并揭示了transformer中不同深度的权重方差演变规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化在训练开始时控制信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度至关重要。需要系统研究不同初始化方法在不同网络架构下的表现，特别是连接经典初始化理论与现代transformer行为。

Method: 1. 对初始标准差进行对数扫描，识别消失和爆炸区域；2. 在ReLU网络中对Kaiming和Xavier初始化进行对比；3. 在12层GPT-2风格模型中追踪Q/K/V权重方差在预训练过程中的演变。

Result: 1. 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定的初始化区域；2. Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中比Xavier收敛更快更稳定；3. Transformer中浅层权重方差快速扩展，深层变化更平缓，最终达到窄带平衡。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原则与现代transformer行为，为鲁棒训练提供了简单实用的初始化方案，强调了深度依赖的权重方差平衡机制的重要性。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力机制，发现当查询输入与交叉注意力输出正交时，模型性能显著提升。正交对齐无需显式约束即可自然产生。

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向，交叉注意力的双重对齐机制共同提升了推荐系统性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常在原始或固定窗口序列上操作，将所有时间步视为同等信息量，这导致在长序列或噪声序列中效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则在多个时间分辨率上检测变化点，然后使用简单函数（如均值）或生成模型（如GMM）总结每个段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够实现85-90%的全模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本，在噪声下提高鲁棒性并保留判别结构。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一个原则性的通用解决方案，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USF等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提供了更好的训练稳定性和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测存在两种主要范式：深度单类分类（如Deep SVDD）和密度估计（如标准化流），但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在揭示这两种方法的内在联系。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）作为连接桥梁，证明通过最大似然训练USF可简化为Deep SVDD目标，并引入防止表示崩溃的正则化。

Result: USFs在多个基准测试和模型骨干上实现了性能提升和训练稳定性改善，适用于图像级和像素级异常检测。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要异常检测范式，既保持了流的密度忠实性，又继承了单类方法的距离推理能力，可作为非USFs的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Motivation: 现有的AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。当不受信任的模型了解协议和监控模型时，可以发起自适应攻击。

Method: 作者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，针对两个主要AI控制基准测试进行攻击。

Result: 前沿模型能够一致地规避各种监控器并完成恶意任务。攻击对当前所有依赖监控器的协议都有效，最近的Defer-to-Resample协议甚至会产生反效果。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应该成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding
within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an
initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing
transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: CRPS-LAM是一种基于CRPS目标训练的LAM概率天气预报模型，通过注入单个潜在噪声向量实现单次前向传播生成集合成员，采样速度比扩散模型快39倍，在MEPS区域数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在LAM中表现出色但采样时计算成本高，需要更高效的集合预报方法。

Method: 基于CRPS目标训练LAM预报模型，通过采样和注入单个潜在噪声向量在单次前向传播中生成集合成员。

Result: 采样速度比扩散模型快39倍，在MEPS区域数据集上匹配扩散模型的低误差，同时保留精细尺度预报细节。

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率区域天气预报的有效方法，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

TL;DR: 论文研究了注意力机制中归一化的局限性，分析了softmax缩放下token向量的距离界限和分离标准，并通过GPT-2实验验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对softmax注意力机制的理解存在局限，需要深入分析其归一化过程对token选择能力的影响，特别是随着选择token数量增加时的性能变化。

Method: 建立理论框架分析注意力机制的选择能力和几何分离特性，通过预训练GPT-2模型进行实证验证，分析距离界限和分离标准。

Result: 随着选择token数量增加，模型区分信息性token的能力下降，趋向均匀选择模式；softmax归一化在低温设置下存在梯度敏感性问题。

Conclusion: softmax注意力机制存在选择能力下降和梯度敏感性问题，需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来改进未来注意力架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究在局部差分隐私(LDP)约束下从分布中采样的局部极小极大风险问题，发现局部最优采样器在固定分布P0附近优于全局极小极大采样器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注全局极小极大最优性，本文从局部视角出发，研究固定分布P0邻域内的极小极大风险，这更符合实际应用中存在公共数据分布的场景。

Method: 将先前纯LDP工作扩展到泛函LDP框架，证明当分布类限制在P0邻域时，全局最优泛函LDP采样器产生局部最优采样器，并推导出局部极小极大最优采样器的闭式表达式。

Result: 确定了局部极小极大风险的确切值，该值依赖于P0和隐私级别，并发现局部最优采样器在实证比较中始终优于全局极小极大采样器。

Conclusion: 局部框架自然地模拟了具有公共数据的私有采样场景，局部最优采样器在P0邻域内比全局方法表现更好，且其表达式不依赖于f-散度的选择。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线对抗模仿学习（AIL），提出了一种基于模型的AIL算法（MB-AIL），在一般函数逼近下建立了无视野依赖的二阶样本复杂度保证，并在理论和实验上验证了其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线对抗模仿学习虽然在实际应用中表现出色，但其在线交互的益处和随机性影响尚未得到充分理解。现有方法缺乏对样本复杂度的理论分析，特别是在随机环境下的性能保证。

Method: 提出基于模型的对抗模仿学习算法（MB-AIL），使用离线专家演示和在线无奖励环境交互，在一般函数逼近框架下进行分析。

Result: MB-AIL实现了无视野依赖的二阶样本复杂度保证，该界限与相关策略下回报的方差相关，在系统趋于确定性时会更加紧密。算法在在线交互样本复杂度上达到极小极大最优（对数因子内），且在专家演示依赖方面与下界匹配。

Conclusion: MB-AIL在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能，验证了在线交互在模仿学习中的重要性，并为随机环境下的AIL提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理和数据驱动模型由于数据异质性和有限观测样本，难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，这限制了环境生态系统的可持续管理。

Method: 提出地理感知嵌入，利用地理信息显式捕捉跨空间区域和尺度的共享原则和模式，并将其集成到门控时空图神经网络中。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

Conclusion: MODE特别适用于处理噪声模式转换，能够预测细胞何时确定其最终命运，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

TL;DR: 提出BaNEL算法，仅使用失败样本进行后训练，最小化奖励评估次数，在稀疏奖励任务中显著提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和密集奖励信号，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：(1)基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号；(2)奖励评估成本高昂

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似已知失败，并引导生成远离这些失败

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中无需观察成功样本即可提升性能，成功率比现有新颖性奖励方法高出数个数量级，且使用更少的奖励评估

Conclusion: BaNEL算法能够有效解决稀疏奖励环境下的学习挑战，仅通过失败样本实现模型改进

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.
