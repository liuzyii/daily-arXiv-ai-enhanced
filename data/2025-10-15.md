### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩引起的视差图噪声来提升高程精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，对高质量3D月球地图的需求日益迫切，特别是像NASA Endurance任务这样需要长距离穿越的任务。Kaguya TC图像虽然全球覆盖，但存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的高程不准确问题。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性的视差噪声模式（特别是在暗区），提出减少压缩图像视差图中残余噪声的方法来增强3D地图质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了高程噪声，提高了地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著改善从Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据支持。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过控制实验比较CLIP和DINO作为视觉编码器的表现，发现CLIP在文本密集型任务上表现更好，而DINO在视觉中心任务上略有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是更大的训练数据。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，然后分析嵌入特征并集成到视觉语言模型中进行评估。

Result: CLIP捕获高层语义（如对象类别、文本），DINO对低层特征（如颜色、风格）更敏感；CLIP在文本密集型VQA任务上表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务上略胜一筹。

Conclusion: 语言监督的变体带来的增益有限，研究为视觉编码器设计及其对VLM性能影响提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一个用于乳腺X线摄影的自监督学习框架，在140万张乳腺图像上预训练，通过乳腺组织感知数据增强和跨切片对比学习，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功训练视觉编码器，但在医学影像中应用有限，主要受限于数据不足和领域特定偏差。

Method: 提出乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器进行图像级和补丁级监督，以及利用3D数字乳腺断层合成结构的跨切片对比学习目标，将3D结构融入2D预训练。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为乳腺X线摄影的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具提供了可扩展、无需标注的基础，有助于减轻放射科医生工作量并提高乳腺癌筛查的诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

### [4] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过估计每个高斯的时间变化不确定性并构建时空图来提升4D重建质量，解决了遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了它们是否被良好观测。这导致在遮挡情况下出现运动漂移，以及在未见视角下合成质量下降。

Method: 提出不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，估计每个高斯的时间变化不确定性，并利用这些不确定性构建时空图进行优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在多样化的真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅至关重要，能够有效提升4D场景重建的稳定性和合成质量，特别是在遮挡和极端视角等挑战性情况下。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [5] [Task-Specific Dual-Model Framework for Comprehensive Traffic Safety Video Description and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11907)
*Blessing Agyei Kyem,Neema Jakisa Owor,Andrews Danyo,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Eugene Denteh,Tanner Muturi,Anthony Dontoh,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双模型框架，分别优化VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL在交通视频分析中的captioning和VQA任务，通过分离训练减少任务干扰，在AI City Challenge中取得第10名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安分析需要复杂的视频理解来捕捉细粒度行为模式并生成全面描述以预防事故，但现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，VideoLLaMA专门用于captioning任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门用于VQA任务，通过任务分离训练策略减少干扰。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上表现优异（CIDEr=1.1001），Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解上表现突出（VQA准确率60.80%），在AI City Challenge中S2得分45.7572，排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略优于联合训练，VQA准确率提升8.6%同时保持captioning质量，证明了任务专业化的重要性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [6] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D是一个基于预训练视频扩散模型的系统，能够从单张参考图像生成可动画化的多视角数字人视频，并蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟形象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人虚拟形象的过程成本高、耗时长，需要大型相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家。现有单图像生成方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角约束，导致视角偏离参考图像时质量下降。

Method: 基于最先进的预训练视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情同时生成数百帧的多视角视频（视角变化可达360度），然后将输出蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D虚拟形象。

Result: 相比先前方法，显著提高了生成虚拟形象的逼真度、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: MVP4D方法有效解决了单图像生成虚拟形象在多视角下的质量问题，实现了高质量、可实时渲染的数字人虚拟形象生成。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [7] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanoTPS-Net模型，通过CNN和薄板样条变换从单张全景图估计3D房间布局，能处理立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在计算机视觉中至关重要，可应用于机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先用CNN提取特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后用TPS变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值分别达到85.49(PanoContext)、86.16(Stanford-2D3D)、81.76(Matterport3DLayout)和91.98(ZInD)。

Conclusion: 该方法在房间布局估计中准确有效，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，能鲁棒处理各种布局类型。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于仓库环境空间推理的专用框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3中获得第四名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在大规模3D仓库环境中面临场景杂乱、遮挡和精确空间理解需求等挑战，缺乏显式空间基础，泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）直接嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别进行任务特定监督的微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案。

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得73.0606的最终分数，排名第四。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers虽然性能优异，但其复杂的注意力机制对可解释性构成挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer在不同医学影像任务中的可解释性，包括外周血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类。

Result: DINO与Grad-CAM组合在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类别区分性强且空间精确的热力图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键的医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下图像退化（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装带来的检测挑战，传统图像增强技术和陆地场景的COD方法难以适应水下环境。

Method: 采用孪生网络架构，结合MSRCR算法进行数据增强生成光照不变图像，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制分层融合位置和边界先验。

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在广泛使用的评估指标上优于15种最先进方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效解决了水下伪装物体检测的关键挑战，在检测精度和鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Method: 通过利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习通用运动表示，生成保持原始运动但允许结构和语义灵活性的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估都表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3成功解决了运动保持视频编辑中的关键挑战，为创作者提供了更好的灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Conclusion: 领域自适应是解决计算机视觉中数据稀缺问题的有效方法，能够使模型在不同领域间进行知识迁移和应用。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [15] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包含EG-Restormer用于严重模糊QR码恢复和LENet用于轻度模糊快速处理，通过边缘引导注意力块显式利用QR码的结构先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码高度结构化模式和锐利边缘的先验知识，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此构建EG-Restormer用于严重模糊恢复；设计轻量高效网络(LENet)用于轻度模糊快速处理；最后集成到自适应双网络(ADNet)中根据输入模糊程度动态选择合适网络。

Result: 大量实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重模糊QR码的解码率方面达到最先进性能，同时保持有竞争力的处理速度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码的结构先验和自适应网络选择机制，在资源受限的移动设备上实现了高效的QR码去模糊和解码。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Conclusion: 准确几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提；提出的方法通过几何指导显著提升了重建质量，特别是在未观察区域，并展示了良好的泛化能力和实际应用前景。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DRL框架解决非排练类增量学习中的三大挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、局部优化与全局推理不一致。通过轻量级适配器和解耦锚点监督实现高效增量学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在类增量学习中面临的三个核心问题：模型规模不断增长、增量阶段间表示空间变化不连续、阶段优化与全局推理目标不一致。

Method: 使用增量并行适配器(IPA)网络，在预训练模型基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现表示能力的继承和传播。设计了解耦锚点监督(DAS)来对齐不同阶段的特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的实验表明，DRL在整个类增量学习过程中持续优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架通过轻量级适配器和解耦监督机制，有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了高效且性能优越的增量学习。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影和人脸颜色问题。

Method: 利用弱引导下预训练扩散模型生成伪参考人脸，通过人脸解析图和划痕掩码进行选择性修复，采用分阶段监督：结构引导贯穿去噪过程，颜色细化在后期步骤。

Result: 在构建的300张真实老照片基准数据集VintageFace上，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导机制有效解决了老照片人脸修复中的局部退化问题，实现了高质量的修复效果。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: ImageSentinel是一个保护视觉数据集在检索增强图像生成系统中免遭未经授权使用的框架，通过生成视觉一致的哨兵图像来检测数据集滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着检索增强图像生成的广泛采用，保护私人图像数据集免遭未经授权使用成为一个重要挑战，传统数字水印方法在该系统中存在局限性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型生成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，这些图像包含随机生成的字符序列作为检索键，用于验证保护。

Result: 实验结果表明，ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一个有效的解决方案，能够在检测滥用行为的同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束优化的编码函数设计方法，用于压缩单光子3D成像，在硬件限制下显著优于传统编码设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、激光功率、传感器数据速率等），压缩直方图虽然解决了数据速率问题，但在实际照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵（编码函数），确保符合硬件约束条件。

Result: 通过广泛仿真验证，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限的系统中优势更明显。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应任意参数化的脉冲响应，在真实世界系统中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为未来多模态研究提供了强大且成本效益高的视觉描述解决方案，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达的生理参数估计中，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构数据分布和标签分布偏差问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法用于持续测试时适应，通过知识融合与分裂机制动态管理类感知域知识，解决现有方法中新知识学习不足和历史知识干扰的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降。

Method: 设计域知识分裂模块自适应分离新域知识，减轻旧域负知识影响；设计域知识融合模块以最小成本合并新知识到现有知识池，采用贪心知识动态合并策略保持计算效率。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过知识融合与分裂机制，能够动态积累判别性历史知识，在持续测试时适应任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的单次医学图像分割方法因使用确定性平均特征而无法捕捉类内多样性，导致原型表示脆弱，难以应对患者间显著的解剖变异。

Method: DPL包含三个核心创新：扩散原型增强模块、空间感知条件机制和保守融合策略，通过前向-反向扩散过程生成多样化原型变体。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验显示，DPL显著提升了单次医学图像分割性能，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程进行特征空间探索，有效解决了单次医学图像分割中原型表示的局限性问题。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但序列压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕捉视频的空间和时间上下文信息，限制了空间信息在帧内和时间信息在帧间的有效传播。

Method: 设计了一个帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及一个帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补地传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了SSP方法显著优于现有的SOTA方法，平均提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，标注成本高昂。边界框标注虽然更易获取，但在重叠区域存在模糊性问题。现有两阶段方法增加了训练复杂性和时间。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均更新。引入基于实例中心的查询细化来增强位置查询定位，并设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效且有效的端到端解决方案，能够在减少标注成本的同时实现高质量的3D实例分割。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法难以有效传递教师MLLM的丰富视觉感知能力到学生模型，主要原因是师生视觉注意力不匹配。

Method: 提出CompoDistill框架，显式对齐学生与教师的视觉注意力，增强学生的视觉感知能力。

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过视觉注意力对齐有效解决了MLLM知识蒸馏中的视觉感知能力传递问题，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂和标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法往往忽视微表情不同时间阶段的独特特征，需要更精细的相位建模。

Method: DIANet双流框架：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段，每个流使用专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了改进的视觉语言推理数据集构建策略，通过系统分析数据构建原则，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，并为推理数据集研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行标记预测效率的同时，显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频两种模态

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中面临的跨域分布偏移和异方差噪声扰动的双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中性能下降明显。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 小波引导的跨域合成生成与目标域对齐的训练样本；2) 真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声问题，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性和优越性能。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性，支持多尺度结构表达和可控的外观编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示严重依赖不稳定的像素级匹配和跟踪，跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动会破坏视觉对象表示，需要更鲁棒的表达方法。

Method: 使用层次化代理节点表示多尺度视觉对象结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频时空先验，解耦形状和纹理表示以实现可控编辑。

Result: 实验表明该方法以更少参数实现高视频重建精度，支持视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑等复杂任务。

Conclusion: 代理节点表示能够稳定表达多尺度视觉结构，有效处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，提供鲁棒的视频表示和编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高而面临数据稀缺问题，传统的交叉熵和Dice损失加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失进一步引入置信度驱动的指数缩放机制，强调困难样本的学习。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优后的加法损失和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制，能够在具有挑战性的数据限制下实现鲁棒的分割性能。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要收集辅助OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 基于卷积局部不变性，从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟OOD视觉表示，通过优化降低这些背景特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，能够显著缓解模型在OOD数据上的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在细节缺失、亮度不均的问题，且梯度损失只关注梯度幅度而忽略方向信息。

Method: 设计跨模态互补掩码模块、细粒度参考图像合成策略（结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化）、角度感知损失（同时约束梯度幅度和方向）。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的综合实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度幅度和方向，能够更好地保留纹理强度和正确的边缘方向，在可见光-红外图像融合任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因为它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同资源。

Method: 提出两个核心贡献：(1)语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，使用混合重要性度量简化非关键场景元素；(2)优先级驱动的渲染管线，通过基于优先级的深度预传递剔除被遮挡基元。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间并将渲染速度提升至超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知语义优先级，成功解决了3D城市场景重建中保真度与计算效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

Conclusion: 提出的DL-DKD++框架通过知识蒸馏和动态软目标机制，有效解决了部分相关视频检索的挑战，在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型中的logo幻觉问题，即模型在没有可见文字的logo图像中错误生成品牌名称或文本内容。通过系统测试发现幻觉问题普遍存在，且与投影器特定维度相关，通过针对性消融可显著减少错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生幻觉输出，即输出内容缺乏视觉证据支持。本文特别关注logo幻觉这一被忽视的问题，旨在系统测量和分析该现象。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文本logo的精选数据集，以及Hard-60挑战子集，系统测量领先VLM的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对LLaVA进行嵌入级分析以识别幻觉相关维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉问题在各种扰动下持续存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融可大幅减少错误，同时保持OCR准确性。模型往往依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知。

Conclusion: 投影器子空间在幻觉失败模式中起决定性作用，特别是对于标志性圆形logo。投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Motivation: 解决街景新视角合成挑战，从训练轨迹的车载帧生成不同轨迹（如不同车道或行驶方向）的渲染图像。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先使用高斯泼溅进行3D场景重建并渲染目标相机视角，然后通过单步扩散模型增强图像质量。

Result: 在测试集上获得综合得分0.432，排名第二。通过PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标验证了模型性能。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合3D重建和生成式增强在街景新视角合成任务中表现优异，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow是一个用于语义场景完成的3D语义占用预测框架，通过光流时间对齐和课程引导深度融合，在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了16.9 mIoU的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SSC方法依赖时间堆叠或深度投影，缺乏明确的运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 使用多级融合策略通过预训练光流对齐跨帧的分割、视觉和深度特征；采用课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度逐步过渡到密集立体深度；利用SAM提供类别无关的语义先验。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了16.9 mIoU的最先进性能，验证了运动引导和课程感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过光流时间对齐和课程深度融合，显著提升了相机基3D语义场景完成的性能，特别是在时间一致性和动态物体理解方面表现优异。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的动态采样机制，在3D医学影像和超声视频分类任务中减少计算复杂度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法虽然解决了不可微问题，但缺乏输入自适应性。

Method: 提出注意力引导的采样模块，该模块在推理过程中也能适应不同输入，克服了传统方法只能任务适应而不能输入适应的局限性。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集（包括一个真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了动态自适应采样，在深度神经网络模型中带来了性能提升并降低了复杂度，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: STORM-PSR是一个双流框架，通过结合空间和时间特征来改进程序步骤识别，特别针对部分遮挡情况下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧图像中的装配物体状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致在物体部分遮挡时模型鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 提出双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流包含空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器，通过弱监督预训练捕获空间表示和时间关系。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，相比先前方法，平均延迟分别减少11.2%和26.1%。时空流不依赖无遮挡视图即可推断完成步骤。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过利用时空特征显著提升了程序步骤识别的性能，特别是在遮挡情况下，证明了时空特征的重要性。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCR模型针对单个场景训练，当训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时模型会退化，需要引入先验知识来提升重建质量。

Method: 将SCR训练重新解释为概率问题，引入从简单深度分布到基于大规模室内扫描训练的3D点云扩散模型等多种先验，在训练过程中将预测的3D场景点推向合理几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，该方法学习到更好的场景表示，产生更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过概率重解释和引入重建先验，能够有效改善SCR模型在约束不足情况下的性能，提升场景重建质量和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型为城市监控提供了有前景的技术方案，能够以类似市民视觉感知的方式评估基础设施状况，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

TL;DR: 提出基于条件流匹配(CFM)的图像质量迁移框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场级图像，在减少参数的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI(LF-MRI)具有经济便携的优势，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 使用条件流匹配(CFM)框架，通过直接回归最优速度场，学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM不仅实现了最先进的性能，还能稳健地泛化到分布内和分布外数据，同时使用的参数显著少于竞争性深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大且可扩展工具，特别适用于资源有限的临床环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统在长视频理解中面临两个主要挑战：无法有效捕捉连续帧的时序上下文，以及稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 提出分层记忆结构，从粗到细定义不同层次的记忆细节和时序范围，通过智能体迭代回溯机制系统挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，性能甚至超过GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy框架通过深度记忆回溯有效解决了长视频理解中的时序建模和细节保留问题，并引入了新的评估基准EgoMem。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 为推进这一新兴领域奠定了基础，概述了未来发展的有前景方向，旨在为研究人员提供系统化的模型设计框架。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 针对深度伪造检测器在黑盒设置下生成可转移且视觉不可感知的对抗样本，解决现有方法在可转移性和不可感知性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦于视觉显著区域的扰动；第二阶段使用度量感知选择模块，基于黑盒模型成功率和结构相似性(SSIM)评估候选样本。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段框架有效平衡了对抗样本的可转移性和不可感知性，在黑盒深度伪造检测攻击中表现出色。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够从运动模糊图像中准确重建3D场景，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Method: 使用Voronoi辅助扩散方法：首先基于两个Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量，然后扩散对齐的法向量形成近似UDF梯度场，最后积分得到最终UDF。

Result: VAD方法能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何体，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效且稳定的UDF计算方法，能够处理各种复杂几何结构，优于现有的神经方法。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，仅采用特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状，避免缓慢的关节后处理形状恢复。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，证明了简单理论驱动设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过逐步构建方法并为每个组件提供明确理论动机，证明了精心设计的扩散模型无需复杂辅助策略就能实现高质量人体运动生成。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出竞争性双策略框架CoIRL-AD，让IL和RL智能体在训练中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上碰撞率降低18%，在长尾场景中表现出更强的泛化能力和改进性能。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合了IL和RL的优势，超越了传统的两阶段训练范式，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含大规模数据集和新颖的多光谱定向感知跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机多目标跟踪中因小目标、严重遮挡和杂乱背景导致的挑战，现有RGB跟踪算法依赖的空间外观线索在航拍视角下容易退化，而多光谱图像能提供增强目标区分度的光谱反射信息。

Method: 提出多光谱定向感知MOT方案：1) 轻量级Spectral 3D-Stem集成光谱特征同时保持RGB预训练兼容性；2) 定向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；3) 端到端定向自适应transformer。

Result: 在代表性跟踪器上的广泛实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集包装物体的跟踪效果改善明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的多光谱定向感知跟踪方案将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关数据集、代码和基准已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但这种方法主要捕捉全局交互，难以保持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现时间对齐的运动生成。

Result: 在多种人体运动任务上的实验表明，模型在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: Temporally Conditional Mamba模型能够有效解决时间依赖输入信号下人体运动生成的时间对齐问题。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业图像分割中数据标注瓶颈问题，利用现有植物专用模型来避免收集和标注新数据集的需求。

Method: 利用Plantnet的植物专用表示识别植物区域生成粗分割掩码，然后通过SAM进行精细化分割。

Result: 在四个不同复杂度的公开数据集上评估，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在IoU指标上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提高生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与学习到的表示相关，外部指导可以加速训练。但作者重新思考这一范式，提出利用模型自身不同层表示质量的差异，让语义丰富的表示指导较弱的表示。

Method: LayerSync是一种即插即用的正则化方法，通过同步扩散模型不同层的中间表示，让语义丰富的层指导较弱的层，无需外部监督、预训练模型或额外数据。

Result: 在图像生成任务上广泛评估，并扩展到音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。显著提高训练效率（如基于流的transformer在ImageNet上训练速度提升8.75倍）和生成质量（提升23.6%）。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种自给自足、领域无关的正则化方法，能一致地提高扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率，无需额外资源。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at
https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

Motivation: 解决像素空间生成模型训练困难、性能不如潜在空间模型的问题，缩小两者之间的性能和效率差距。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义，并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，端到端微调完整模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型FID达到2.04（75 NFE），ImageNet-512上FID 2.35；一致性模型单步采样FID 8.82，大幅超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功缩小了像素空间与潜在空间生成模型的性能差距，首次实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型训练。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高

Method: IVT-LR在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息，每个推理步骤由潜在文本和潜在视觉组成，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，准确率平均提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法有效解决了多模态推理中的标注负担和推理效率问题

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法能够有效处理真实世界的复杂噪声，无需噪声分布假设，具有高效和优越的去噪性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的人体网格恢复方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高昂。作者发现分层视觉基础模型的中间阶段能产生与非分层模型相当或更高分辨率的特征图，这为构建轻量级模型提供了机会。

Method: 构建了三种轻量级HMR2.0变体，并提出利用Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer和VMamba等分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段（仅前2-3阶段）作为编码器。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层视觉基础模型的HMR和HPE模型，发现仅使用前2-3阶段的模型性能与完整阶段模型相当，且在准确性和计算效率之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人体网格恢复和姿态估计任务，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为轻量级模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication

Result: 实验表明EReLiFM在OSDG-NL任务上优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配有效解决了带噪声标签的开放集域泛化问题。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合解释引导学习框架H-EGL，结合自监督和人工引导约束来增强注意力对齐，提高医学图像分类的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学成像中表现优异，但容易学习虚假相关性导致偏见和泛化能力有限。人工-AI注意力对齐可以缓解这些问题，但依赖昂贵的监督标注。

Method: H-EGL框架包含自监督组件，利用类别区分性注意力而不依赖限制性先验，促进鲁棒性和灵活性。在胸部X光分类中使用Vision Transformer进行验证。

Result: H-EGL在胸部X光分类任务中优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，展现出更好的分类准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: H-EGL能够产生与人类专家知识更好对齐的注意力图，有效提升医学图像分类的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型在"与图像思考"范式下能力的基准测试，包含1,204个跨5个领域的视觉任务，显示当前模型在整合视觉和通用工具方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要遵循"关于图像思考"的范式，将图像视为静态输入，而现实场景中用户提供的图像往往不完美，需要主动的图像操作来发现关键视觉线索。

Method: 引入IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个具有挑战性的开放视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，每个任务都配有详细评分标准。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现不佳，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率。不同模型表现出不同的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于"与图像思考"范式的基准测试，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过正交LoRA适配器分离通用知识和客户端特定知识，使每个客户端能充分利用自身和其他客户端的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用广泛，但需要针对特定任务进行微调。由于患者隐私保护限制，难以共享和聚合不同来源的数据进行训练。联邦学习可以解决这个问题，但需要更好的个性化微调方法。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，在多个参与客户端（如医院、诊所）上进行联邦微调。

Result: 在真实世界的联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 所提出的个性化联邦微调方法能够有效利用各客户端数据，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、局部约束稀疏注意力和微型条件解码器实现17 FPS的高效性能，在A100 GPU上处理768x1408视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在真实世界视频超分辨率中面临的高延迟、计算量大和超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，使扩散基VSR技术实用化。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率，使用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算并弥合训练-测试分辨率差距，设计微型条件解码器加速重建。

Result: 在A100 GPU上达到约17 FPS处理768x1408视频，相比之前的一步扩散VSR模型提速12倍，在超高分辨率下可靠扩展并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FlashVSR通过效率、可扩展性和实时性能使扩散基VSR实用化，将发布代码、预训练模型和VSR-120K数据集促进高效扩散基VSR研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

TL;DR: SPORTS是一个集成视频全景分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染的统一框架，通过注意力机制融合多模态特征，提升场景感知、理解和模拟能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏性和视角限制方面的问题，为具身AI代理提供更全面的场景理解能力。

Method: 采用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征，结合姿态、深度和光流模态；通过后匹配策略改进身份跟踪；将全景分割结果与光流图结合提升动态物体置信度估计；基于学习的范式生成完整深度图；使用点云渲染将稀疏点云转换为神经场。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成VPS、VO和SR任务，实现了更准确和完整的场景理解与模拟，为具身AI提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VQArt-Bench，一个用于文化遗产领域的大规模视觉问答基准，通过多智能体管道生成多样化问题，评估多模态大语言模型在视觉艺术分析中的深度语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，无法捕捉人类视觉查询的多样性和深度，导致模型利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细致问题，构建沿相关视觉理解维度结构化的基准。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估显示当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench基准揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在深度视觉语义理解方面的不足，特别是在文化遗产领域的复杂视觉分析任务中。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让多模态模型的理解模块评估生成模块，实现自我改进，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型的理解能力与生成能力之间存在显著差距，模型能正确理解图像但无法生成忠实图像。研究探索模型能否通过理解模块奖励生成模块来实现自我改进。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度对象级保真度，创建理解模块评估生成模块的反馈循环。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上性能从82.18提升至88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升至46.75，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型的理解模块能够通过自奖励来指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为E-MoFlow的无监督框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，在事件相机数据上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计作为独立任务处理，但在事件相机中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，单独解决这两个问题变得不适定。现有方法存在偏差、计算开销大或容易陷入局部最优的问题。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；引入微分几何约束整合结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计但保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法适用于一般6-DoF运动场景，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法相竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中联合估计的挑战。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和交叉注意力的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，用于从3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件运动跟踪设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑PET成像中会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确，而基于硬件的运动跟踪在临床实践中应用有限。

Method: 使用深度学习监督训练方法，利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动跟踪的金标准运动测量数据，通过交叉注意力机制预测头部运动。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种放射性示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，生成的运动校正图像与金标准硬件跟踪结果难以区分，标准摄取值差异比HRRT为1.2±0.5%，mCT为0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除硬件运动跟踪的负担，使运动校正技术能够在临床环境中广泛应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Motivation: 解决现有基于学习的特征上采样方法需要为每个特征提取器重新训练的问题，无法在推理时泛化到不同特征类型。

Method: 提出推理时的特征无关上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，可应用于各种特征类型。

Result: 在特征上采样方面达到新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，无法有效表示场景动态的多模态特性和不确定性，需要能直接预测局部运动分布的方法。

Method: 使用Flow Poke Transformer框架，基于稀疏交互（pokes）直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示。

Result: 在密集人脸运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务中，经过微调后在关节物体运动估计上显著优于域内方法；在移动部件分割任务中取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示，在多个任务中展现出优越性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过层间注意力池化机制提取文本和视觉token的语义和细节信息，并提出了VERIFI方法增强推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。现有解决方案需要大量计算资源和数据，限制了可访问性。

Method: 使用冻结的VLM作为统一编码器，提出层间注意力池化(LAP)机制提取多层级信息，并提出VERIFI方法在推理时仅使用VLM生成的文本token进行条件生成。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构，能够忠实传递视觉信息。微调编辑任务不仅改善了生成对齐，还展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计实现了有效的跨模态知识迁移，在单图像编辑训练后能够零样本泛化到多图像参考，验证了该设计的有效性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO是一种新的训练算法，通过视觉一致性学习让多模态大语言模型根据图像语义复杂度自适应调整视觉token数量，减少推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型由于图像输入引入的额外视觉token导致推理成本增加

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同连接器响应间的KL散度，推理时通过视觉分辨率路由器自动选择合适压缩率

Result: 实验结果表明该方法可将视觉token数量减少50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于开发更高效的多模态大语言模型，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持久性（CMP）集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持久性，在医学影像和计算机视觉任务中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多过滤结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。CuMPerLay旨在解决这些挑战，将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，联合学习双过滤函数，并确保可微性以集成到Swin Transformer等先进架构中。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上的实验显示，CuMPerLay在分类和分割任务中提升性能，特别是在数据有限的情况下。理论分析证明了在广义Wasserstein度量下的稳定性保证。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为在结构化图像分析中将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像来解决VLA模型的监督不足问题，使用自回归和扩散两种世界模型架构，结合轻量级动作专家实现实时部署，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型面临的"监督不足"问题，即模型的大容量仅由稀疏的低维动作监督，导致表示能力未充分利用。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，使用世界建模预测未来图像，生成密集的自监督信号；为两种主要VLA架构分别实现自回归世界模型（离散视觉标记）和扩散世界模型（连续视觉特征）；引入轻量级动作专家解决推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上显著超越BEV和VLA基线方法；增强了数据缩放定律，显示随着训练数据集增大，性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模是解决VLA模型监督不足的有效方法，能够充分利用模型表示能力，DriveVLA-W0在自动驾驶任务中展现出优越性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的多模态大语言模型，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当或更优的目标检测性能，并通过特殊任务设计、数据引擎和两阶段训练解决了现有MLLM在目标检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导目标检测领域，而现有的MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题。本文旨在弥合这一差距，开发能够实现最先进目标感知性能的MLLM。

Method: 1) 任务设计：使用特殊token表示0-999的量化坐标；2) 数据引擎：构建高质量的基础、参考和指向数据；3) 训练流程：采用两阶段训练，包括2200万数据的监督微调和基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到与回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）相当或更优的性能，并展现出对象参考、指向、视觉提示、GUI基础、空间参考、OCR和关键点检测等多样化能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，证明了MLLM在目标检测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够执行按需多轮网络搜索、动态构建图像和文本搜索查询的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段训练和创新的数据集解决了现有搜索增强方法的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要开发能够动态适应现实世界变化信息的多模态搜索模型。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。创建了DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪种搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网络搜索，并迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Conclusion: 该研究为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，展示了动态查询构建和迭代搜索策略在多模态信息检索中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题中表现出记忆依赖而非真实推理能力，当谜题稍作修改时性能显著下降，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板来解答逻辑谜题。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准测试，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本，评估11个领先的LLM，并开发自动化逻辑等价判断工具和提示缓解框架。

Result: 模型在未修改谜题上表现接近完美，但在扰动版本上显著低于人类水平，表现出幻影回忆和过度阐述等错误模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文线索变化时往往无法重新推理，突显了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

TL;DR: LLMs作为世界模型在数字环境中增强决策，但存在幻觉和静态知识限制，导致长时程模拟误差累积。R-WoM通过检索外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟，在长时程任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否适合作为世界模型，解决其在模拟未来状态和预测行动结果时因幻觉和静态知识导致的误差累积问题。

Method: 通过三个任务评估LLMs的世界建模能力：下一状态识别、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别。提出检索增强世界模型（R-WoM），通过检索外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟。

Result: LLMs能有效捕捉即时下一状态和识别有意义的状态转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降。R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别实现25.3%和18.1%的性能提升，在长时程模拟中优势明显。

Conclusion: LLMs在长时程世界建模中存在局限性，而R-WoM通过检索增强能有效提升模拟可靠性，特别是在复杂长时程任务中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs对输入变化的敏感性源于其内部知识表示的不稳定性。通过语义保持的扰动测试，发现随着样本偏离预训练分布，真假陈述的可分离性显著下降，表明LLMs学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs性能脆弱性的根本原因，检验这种脆弱性是否源于不稳定的内部知识表示。

Method: 应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重述）将样本推向分布外，在四个LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法上测试表示可分离性的退化情况。

Result: 随着样本呈现形式与预训练数据相似度降低，真假陈述的内部表示可分离性显著下降，LLMs区分真假的能力高度依赖于陈述的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: LLMs可能学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，这解释了基准测试性能的脆弱性，并对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间思考过程对翻译性能的影响，特别是在不同资源水平和设置下的效果。

Method: 使用蒸馏思维链方法微调模型，生成详细的逐步翻译解释作为中间token；同时尝试模块化翻译策略构建中间token。

Result: 单纯的"思考token"不能帮助LRMs更好地执行机器翻译，但通过模块化翻译策略构建的中间token可以带来性能提升。

Conclusion: 中间token在微调过程中的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试，使用教师模型优化目标翻译或扩展平行语料比蒸馏其思维链解释更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Method: MIND通过用户参与的循环事实检查流程，突出显示对文化敏感问题的不同回答，这些回答因地区和背景而异。

Result: 在母婴健康领域的双语问答系统上评估MIND，并发布了标注事实和文化不一致的双语问题数据集。在所有测试案例中，MIND都能可靠地识别不一致性。

Conclusion: MIND支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统。

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码仓库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源，通过将代码分解并重组为结构上类似形式数学语句的模拟数据，显著提升了模型在数学形式化任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上表现不佳，主要受限于大规模非正式与正式数学语句配对语料的稀缺性。虽然现有模型能够从自然语言生成代码，但代码与形式数学之间的结构和语法差异限制了有效的迁移学习。

Method: TopoAlign框架将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装这些组件，生成在结构上镜像形式数学语句的模拟数据。这种方法无需额外的人工标注，即可生成结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math模型上，TopoAlign使BEq@10性能提升17.77%，typecheck@10性能提升68.82%。对于专门的Herald模型，尽管没有引入新的数学知识，BEq@10和typecheck@10分别提升了0.12%和1.09%。

Conclusion: TopoAlign框架证明，通过结构对齐的代码数据进行训练，即使对于专门的数学模型也是有益的，为数学大语言模型的训练提供了新的有效资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

TL;DR: GRAVITY框架通过生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据，减少对人类标注的依赖，实现更可扩展的LLM个性化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM个性化依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，难以扩展且忽略深层用户属性

Method: 整合人口统计、文化和心理学框架，生成捕捉用户兴趣、价值观、信念和人格特质的合成偏好数据对

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述生成任务中，相比基线方法获得超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%情况下更受偏好

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少标注成本，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs方法，用于自动生成不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询的RAG基准测试，显著提升了RAG系统评估的挑战性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实RAG系统面临复杂查询时，相关信息可能缺失或不完整，但现有基准测试无法反映真实任务复杂度，容易被作弊式推理绕过，限制了发现RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了首个自动、难度可控的管道，可生成不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询，适用于任何语料库和领域。

Result: 在两个流行RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验显示相比现有基准，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低高达81.0%。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一种简单方法来增强基准测试的难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [97] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD)方法，利用预训练LLM中不同层次的分工特性，仅使用后期层同时生成多个token，实现2倍加速且性能损失较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中早期层处理输入理解、中间层处理任务特定处理、后期层生成输出的层次分工特性，假设经过前两层处理后得到的隐藏状态已包含足够信息，可直接用后期层同时生成多个token，避免重复遍历早期和中间层。

Method: 提出DMTD推理范式，仅使用预训练模型的后期层同时解码多个token，无需额外参数、辅助程序或后生成验证。通过对Qwen3-4B模型进行有限数据集的微调实现该方法。

Result: 微调后的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型实现了高达2倍的加速，仅带来轻微性能损失。缩放分析表明，使用更大训练数据集可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有效的多token解码方法，无需额外开销即可显著提升推理速度，且随着训练数据规模扩大，性能有望进一步提升。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Context-Folding框架，让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，从而在长视野任务中大幅减少上下文使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受限于上下文长度，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 开发了Context-Folding框架和FoldGRPO强化学习算法，通过过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理，智能体可以分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（Deep Research和SWE）上，折叠智能体性能与ReAct基线相当或更好，同时使用的活动上下文减少了10倍，显著优于基于摘要的上下文管理方法。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，通过主动的上下文管理实现了更高效的任务执行。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出自动形式化需要先进行猜想，现有评估高估了LLMs的自动形式化能力。作者创建了ConjectureBench数据集，设计了Lean-FIRe方法，显著提升了端到端自动形式化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动形式化研究忽视了猜想这一关键前置步骤，导致对LLMs能力的评估存在偏差。需要专门评估和提升LLMs的猜想能力。

Method: 创建ConjectureBench数据集，重新设计评估框架和指标，提出推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想和自动形式化。

Result: 发现当考虑猜想时，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1的自动形式化性能被显著高估。Lean-FIRe方法首次成功实现了13个PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但需要将猜想作为独立任务处理，并研究如何正确整合到自动形式化流程中。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互式智能体评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识（如理想客户画像和业务基础设施）来生成更真实、多样化的交互，能发现更多智能体错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮交互智能体评估方法通常依赖人工评估，而基于模拟用户的替代方法往往建模通用用户，忽视了领域特定原则，无法捕捉真实用户行为。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，整合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），使模拟器能生成反映目标市场用户信息需求和期望的交互。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更加真实和多样化，同时能识别出高达33%更多的智能体错误，显示出其作为评估工具的有效性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过整合业务知识，为多轮交互智能体评估提供了更有效的模拟用户方法，支持错误发现和智能体迭代改进。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭问题日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特问题来防止作弊，同时提供大量练习题目。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，并开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 实验表明生成问题的准确性与教材问题相当，难度也与教材问题相似，验证了系统质量。

Conclusion: 提出的自动问题生成系统能有效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，具有与教材问题相当的准确性和难度。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较神经符号系统和LLM系统在农业领域信息抽取的性能，LLM系统在F1分数上表现更好(69.4 vs 52.7)，但各有优缺点：神经符号系统运行更快、控制性更强，而LLM系统性能更高、部署更易但运行较慢且存在幻觉风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域（猪肉、乳制品、作物）的9个访谈数据上，对比评估神经符号系统和LLM系统的信息抽取能力。

Result: LLM系统在总体F1分数(69.4)和核心信息F1分数(63.0)上均优于神经符号系统(52.7和47.2)。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间取得平衡，不能单纯追求性能指标。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

TL;DR: 提出CPR框架，通过优化模糊提示来减少LLM幻觉，使用微调的小模型清理提示并生成额外任务描述，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常因用户使用结构不良或模糊的提示而生成看似合理但错误的"幻觉"事实，这削弱了信任。

Method: 引入治愈性提示优化框架，使用微调的小语言模型清理不良提示并生成额外信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图。

Result: 应用CPR后，提示的生成质量显著提高，幻觉得到缓解，在无外部知识的情况下胜率超过90%。

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效减少因不良提示导致的LLM幻觉，提高生成质量，且无需外部知识。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但仍面临幻觉问题，其中不规范提示（模糊措辞、语法错误、信息不完整）的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: MPR框架通过多个阶段系统优化不规范提示，每个阶段针对特定错误（标点、拼写、关键词误用），使用微调的小语言模型，并采用自反思机制和排序来优先处理最相关输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式达到85%以上的胜率，有效减少幻觉并提高输出准确性，且能与现有后处理幻觉缓解框架结合使用。

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级、适应性强的解决方案，可在多个领域提升大语言模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Result: 通过对代表性方法的实证研究，展示了不确定性量化在识别不可靠生成和提高可靠性方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化为LLM幻觉检测提供了重要机制，但仍存在局限性，需要进一步研究来完善这一领域。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

TL;DR: 提出了分层对齐方法，针对Transformer架构中不同功能层进行定向优化，避免了传统DPO的统一优化方式带来的对齐税问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐技术将模型视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层的功能专门化特性

Method: 分层对齐方法，将模型层分为局部（语法）、中间（逻辑）和全局（事实性）三个功能块，使用LoRA进行定向微调

Result: 局部层对齐提升语法流畅性，全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是提升逻辑一致性的最有效策略，所有分层策略都避免了传统DPO的对齐税问题

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，展示了从单一优化转向结构感知微调的巨大潜力

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：内存占用随序列长度增加而增长，以及性能随上下文长度增加而下降的ContextRot现象。

Method: APCE方法通过低维语义相似度匹配，选择与当前查询最相关的输入块进行处理，从而减少需要处理的输入序列长度。

Result: 在长上下文摘要任务中，APCE使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到与完整密集基线相当或更优的性能，同时显著提高了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种兼容性强的上下文感知效率解决方案，有望激发更多相关研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中的表现，发现在两个数据集上都优于NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest防护系统，具有更高的敏感性和平衡的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，需要有效的安全过滤器来防止破坏性行为。

Method: 使用Verily精神健康危机数据集(1,800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，进行临床医生标注，并与两个开源内容审核防护系统进行对比分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出高敏感性(0.990)和特异性(0.992)，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上敏感性0.982，准确性0.921。在所有情况下都显著优于对比系统(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF表现出稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化遗漏危机，这是医疗应用的关键特性。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

*Ziliang Qiu,Renfen Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PACE方法，通过让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，该方法能有效避免数据污染问题，并与人类评估结果高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs创造力评估面临数据污染和昂贵人工评估的挑战，受人类创造力评估启发，需要一种高效可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出PACE方法，让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，该方法简单高效且能最小化数据污染风险。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena创意写作排名高度相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLMs达到普通人水平，但专业人士仍优于LLMs；语言分析显示人类和LLMs关联具体性都下降，但人类关联模式更多样。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLMs创造力的有效方法，虽然高性能LLMs在关联创造力上接近普通人水平，但专业人士仍明显优于LLMs，且人类展现出更丰富的关联模式多样性。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言领域适应(ML-DA)中LLMs的学习动态，提出了AdaXEval评估方法，发现在高质量双语语料下跨语言知识转移仍然具有挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言领域适应被广泛用于在LLMs中跨语言学习新领域知识，但多语言知识获取机制（知识如何在语言内学习和跨语言转移）仍未充分探索，导致在低资源设置下性能不佳。

Method: 提出了AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从用于训练的同一双语领域语料构建多项选择QA数据集；通过不同数据配方的持续训练，跟踪LLMs如何获取领域事实，并确定从领域训练数据到知识的转换过程机制。

Result: 在13B英日双语LLM上的实验表明，尽管使用了高质量双语语料，跨语言转移仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 跨语言知识转移在ML-DA中仍然是一个困难的问题，即使使用高质量双语语料，LLMs在多语言领域适应中的学习机制需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了端到端大语音语言模型中的模态鸿沟问题，发现语音和文本输入在深层表示中方向对齐但幅度分离，并提出基于对齐路径评分和关键令牌干预的方法来改善语音输入性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端大语音语言模型在对话生成方面表现出色，但在语义理解基准测试中始终落后于传统流水线系统，需要深入理解语音和文本输入之间的性能差距。

Method: 通过系统实验分析语音和文本表示的粗粒度和细粒度特征，引入对齐路径评分量化令牌级对齐质量，并设计角度投影和长度归一化等干预策略。

Result: 发现语音和文本表示在深层网络中方向相似度增加但欧氏距离扩大，表示相似度与模态鸿沟强相关，提出的干预策略显示出改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统分析了LSLMs中的模态鸿沟和对齐机制，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话比单轮提示更具风险，但现有基准测试未能充分考虑这种情况。

Method: 引入SafeMT基准测试，包含10,000个样本，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法。提出安全指数(SI)评估对话安全性，并设计对话安全调节器检测对话中的恶意意图。

Result: 评估了17个模型，发现有害对话轮次增加时，成功攻击风险上升。实验表明提出的安全调节器比现有防护模型更能有效降低多轮攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 当前模型的安全机制不足以识别对话交互中的危险，提出的对话安全调节器能更有效地保护多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Credal Transformer，通过基于证据理论的Credal Attention Mechanism替代标准注意力机制，生成credal set而非单一注意力向量，直接量化模型不确定性，显著减少幻觉和自信错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型产生幻觉，做出事实错误但自信的断言。这源于Transformer的Softmax函数通过将模糊注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了每层的不确定性信息。

Method: 引入Credal Transformer，用基于证据理论的Credal Attention Mechanism替代标准注意力机制。将注意力分数重新概念化为Dirichlet分布的证据质量，产生credal set（分布集合）而非单一注意力向量。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在无法回答的问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: Credal Transformer提供了一种新的架构来减轻幻觉，以及一个将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范式，为更可靠的AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Conclusion: 并行推理是克服传统序列推理脆弱性的重要方向，本文为初学者提供了路线图，并鼓励更多研究改进并行推理方法。

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了将离散空间的推理缩放技术（多样本生成结合PRM/ORM重排序）应用于连续空间推理的可行性，发现虽然能生成多样化的推理路径，但由于连续思维表示缺乏关键归纳偏置，导致PRM/ORM模型难以有效区分正确和错误推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是将已在离散文本推理中证明有效的推理时缩放技术（多样本生成+PRM/ORM重排序）扩展到连续空间推理中，验证这些成熟技术在连续思维空间中的适应性和有效性。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干模型，通过dropout-based采样生成多样化推理路径，进行Pass@N分析，并探究几何特性和轨迹动态等各个方面来识别PRM/ORM在连续空间中失效的原因。

Result: 研究表明在连续空间中生成多样化推理路径是可行的，但离散空间中的数据生成和PRM/ORM训练方法在连续空间中只能带来边际改进。分析发现当前连续思维表示缺乏关键归纳偏置，阻碍了正确与错误推理的有效区分。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确纳入可在推理时用于区分正确与错误思维的归纳偏置，这是实现连续空间中有效推理缩放的关键。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了真实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验知识，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从大语言模型提取生物医学实体的语义丰富治疗相关文本表示，并用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE中。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入LLM提取的治疗相关知识，显著改善了生物医学概念在知识图谱中的表示，增强了语义理解能力，为药物重定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是模型预测时间戳时存在的系统性偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，分析时间偏差的普遍性、与音频长度的关系以及不同事件类型和位置的差异，并提出了时间偏差指数(TBI)和可视化框架来量化该现象。

Result: 研究发现：(1)时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在；(2)偏差随音频长度增加而累积，在长录音中可达数十秒；(3)偏差因事件类型和位置而异。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位局限性，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一系统性偏差问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型如SHAS虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但仍受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，而这对实时自然翻译至关重要。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的分割框架，通过直接偏好优化训练，使LLM能够预测更符合实时翻译需求的自然分割点。

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库上评估，DPO调优的LLM在分割准确率上超越SHAS，在翻译质量和延迟方面均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推动自适应、人类对齐的实时翻译发展。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出HALF框架，通过考虑伤害严重程度来评估LLM在真实应用场景中的公平性，发现LLM在不同领域的公平性表现不一致，模型大小或性能不能保证公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM公平性评估缺乏真实场景基础，且未考虑不同领域伤害严重程度的差异，比如手术决策偏见与文本摘要风格偏见的危害程度不同。

Method: 开发HALF框架，将9个应用领域分为三个严重等级（严重、中等、轻微），使用五阶段流程评估模型偏见并加权伤害严重程度。

Result: 评估8个LLM发现：(1) LLM在不同领域的公平性不一致；(2) 模型大小或性能不能保证公平性；(3) 推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育领域表现更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与实际部署准备度之间的明显差距，强调了基于伤害严重程度的公平性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德偏见，并研究其具体表现机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重的大语言模型上进行层修补分析，通过将预训练模型的激活修补到微调模型的关键层来研究偏见定位。

Result: 发现Knobe效应不仅在学习过程中被习得，而且被定位在特定层中，仅需修补少数关键层的激活就能消除这种偏见。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，无需重新训练模型，为目标干预提供了新证据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted

### [123] [DSAS: A Universal Plug-and-Play Framework for Attention Optimization in Multi-Document Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12251)
*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DSAS（双阶段自适应锐化）方法来解决LLM在多文档问答任务中的长距离依赖建模和"中间迷失"问题，该方法无需修改架构或额外训练参数，在多个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难（难以关注长文本中的关键信息）和"中间迷失"问题（难以处理长输入中间位置的信息）。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单的解决方案。

Method: DSAS包含两个模块：(1) 上下文门控加权模块通过层间注意力跟踪和位置感知加权来评估段落相关性，缓解"中间迷失"问题；(2) 互斥注意力抑制模块通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换，增强对关键段落的关注，改善长距离依赖建模。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLM（Llama、Qwen、Mistral、Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上的多文档问答任务中平均F1分数提高了4.2%。消融研究证实了两个模块的贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一种即插即用的解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLM在多文档问答中的核心挑战，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

*Blazej Manczak,Eric Lin,Francisco Eiras,James O' Neill,Vaikkunth Mugunthan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了MedQA-Followup框架，评估医学问答中多轮对话的鲁棒性，发现LLMs在受到挑战时准确率大幅下降，间接干预比直接建议更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要针对单轮问答的理想条件，忽略了医学咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂因素，需要系统评估LLMs在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），同时引入间接-直接轴区分上下文框架和明确建议。在MedQA数据集上使用受控干预评估五个最先进的LLMs。

Result: 模型在浅层扰动下表现尚可，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4的准确率从91.2%降至13.5%。间接、基于上下文的干预通常比直接建议更具破坏性。不同模型在重复干预下表现各异，有的进一步下降，有的部分恢复甚至改善。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医学LLMs安全可靠部署的关键但未被充分探索的维度，当前模型在临床部署中存在显著脆弱性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头训练的中文编码器，通过优化词汇表、掩码策略、预训练流程和学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现了Pareto改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer改进主要针对英文，中文在分词和词法结构上差异显著，需要专门优化的中文编码器。

Method: 使用32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码、两阶段预训练扩展上下文长度、阻尼余弦学习率调度，在1.2T中文token上预训练。

Result: 在CLUE基准上与传统中文编码器竞争，长序列吞吐量高，短序列速度快；在SimCLUE上通过对比学习微调达到0.505/0.537相关系数。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT展示了中文编码器的可扩展路径，通过硬件感知设计和数据优化实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的无监督流水线方法，用于大规模语料库的自动化语法标注，在COHA语料库的143,933个句子标注中实现了98%以上的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语料库快速扩张背景下人工标注成为方法论瓶颈的问题，寻求可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流程：提示工程、事前评估、自动化批量处理、事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行标注。

Result: 在60小时内完成了COHA语料库中143,933个句子的标注，在两个复杂标注任务上达到98%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够以最小人工干预完成大规模数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能性，但需要考虑成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反仇恨言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要开发更可信和连贯的生成框架。

Method: 将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，集成RAG管道，构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，覆盖联合国和欧盟等权威来源。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该框架在标准指标和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反言论生成开辟了新途径，适用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐关系可以揭示语言处理的计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测关系这一有争议的研究问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词汇，并利用该方法研究大脑对齐与下一个词预测的关系。

Result: 发现大脑对齐和下一个词预测依赖于不同的词汇子集：下一个词预测表现出近期和首因偏见，关注句法；而大脑对齐优先考虑语义和语篇层面的信息，具有更针对性的近期效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作增进了我们对LLMs与人类语言处理关系的理解，突出了大脑对齐和下一个词预测在特征依赖上的差异，所开发的归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在各种语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制减少不重要token的专家数量来加速推理，同时保持重要token的完整专家以保证模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的稀疏激活机制虽然支持将不活跃专家存储在CPU DRAM中，但受限于CPU-GPU互连带宽。现有的预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果有限。

Method: 提出混合大小专家机制，将不重要token的专家数量减半以加速，同时为重要token保留完整专家；设计了专用的回退和预取机制来在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上评估，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MoBiLE框架有效解决了MoE推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，实现了显著的推理加速且保持模型质量。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，研究其作为审稿人对学术公平的影响，探索LLM在研究和评审双重角色中的潜在风险。

Method: 通过模拟实验，设置研究代理生成和修订论文，评审代理评估提交的论文，并基于模拟结果进行人工标注分析。

Result: 发现LLM审稿人系统性地给LLM撰写的论文打高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文持续低分，存在语言特征偏见和批判陈述厌恶两种主要偏见。

Conclusion: LLM作为审稿人存在公平性风险，需谨慎使用；但LLM指导的修订能提升论文质量，对早期研究者和低质量论文有益。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对200多种语言的大规模跨语言评估显示，当前大语言模型的tokenization存在系统性不平等，拉丁文字语言效率更高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言的token膨胀率高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文使用减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: tokenization差异是人工智能在语言多样性群体中实现公平访问的重要障碍，需要系统量化大语言模型中的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，对200多种语言样本应用一致的预处理和规范化协议，通过tiktoken库进行统一tokenization，收集Tokens Per Sentence (TPS)和Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC)等评估指标。

Result: 拉丁文字语言tokenization效率更高，非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言的token膨胀显著，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用率降低。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势，未来研究应优先开发语言感知的tokenization策略和适应性词汇构建方法，确保更具包容性和计算公平的多语言AI系统。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索，解决了知识超图检索增强生成中的静态规划、非自适应检索和浅层结构利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的RAG方法存在三个主要限制：静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对KH结构和语义的浅层使用，这限制了它们进行有效多跳问答的能力。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：上下文感知规划模块、结构化问题分解过程和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG高出19.73%，生成评估分数高出8.41%，并在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH通过动态规划和推理框架有效克服了现有知识超图RAG方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLEAR框架，通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态来定位知识冲突，并采用冲突感知微调来提升RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆的关键问题。

Method: CLEAR框架：1) 将上下文分解为细粒度句子级知识；2) 使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3) 引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在各种冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过分析LLM内部表示和冲突定位，有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为理解LLM如何整合外部知识提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLM在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能像人类一样处理新词，但准确性主要受训练数据量而非语言复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM的语言能力是否接近人类水平，以及模型表现是受语言结构复杂性还是训练数据量的影响。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语和西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能像人类一样对新词进行形态学泛化，但准确性模式与社区规模和数据可用性更相关，而非结构复杂性。资源丰富的语言（西班牙语、英语）表现更好。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂性的敏感性，其表现仅表面上类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Method: SMEC框架包含三个核心组件：Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning (SMRL) 缓解训练梯度方差，Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) 减少维度剪枝时的信息退化，Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) 增强高低维嵌入间的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上的实验表明，SMEC在显著降低维度的同时保持性能。在BEIR数据集上，将压缩后的LLM2Vec嵌入（256维）性能相比Matryoshka-Adaptor和Search-Adaptor分别提高了1.1和2.7个点。

Conclusion: SMEC框架有效解决了高维嵌入的计算和存储问题，在保持语义信息的同时实现了高效的维度压缩。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了首个个性化机器生成文本检测基准，揭示了现有检测器在个性化设置中的性能下降问题，并提出了一种预测检测器性能变化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成能力的提升，身份冒充风险增加，但现有研究尚未关注个性化机器生成文本检测问题。

Method: 构建了包含文学作品和博客文本及其LLM生成模仿的基准数据集，提出了基于特征反转陷阱的M方法，通过识别潜在特征方向来预测检测器性能变化。

Result: 实验显示在个性化设置中检测器性能存在显著差距，部分先进模型性能大幅下降，提出的M方法能准确预测性能变化方向和幅度，与实际性能差距相关性达85%。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了个性化文本检测的重要性，提出的方法能有效预测检测器在个性化设置中的性能变化，鼓励进一步研究个性化文本检测。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术此前仅限于有可验证正确答案的领域，本研究旨在将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务

Method: 使用三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验

Result: 两个基准方法在LeWiDi任务上持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法无效

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功迁移到LeWiDi任务，分析了这种差距的潜在原因

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

TL;DR: VLMs在典型和异常图像上的概念理解存在权衡，当图像与文本不一致时，概念理解会下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在处理典型和异常实例时如何在语义先验（概念表征）和语用先验（输入一致性）之间进行权衡

Method: 引入VISaGE评估数据集，包含典型和异常图像，进行平衡实验分析VLMs的表现

Result: 当图像与文本不一致时，概念理解明显下降，语用先验的影响强于语义先验

Conclusion: VLMs在处理个体实例时更依赖语用先验，当输入不一致时概念理解会受损

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

*Bryan Eikema,Evgenia Ilia,José G. C. de Souza,Chrysoula Zerva,Wilker Aziz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让LLM忠实表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的响应通常没有或使用了不反映这种变异性的不确定性修饰语，这造成了忠实性差距。

Method: 通过增强模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'、'很可能'）来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，仅需模型和一组提示即可，无需额外监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教导LLM忠实传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法在真实场景中泛化能力有限，容易受到改写攻击，且缺乏解释性，特别是在面对风格多样性或人机混合创作时表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合特征提取器量化风格差异，联合建模离散风格指标和基于语义嵌入的连续风格表示，在统一表示空间中捕捉人类与LLM输出的风格差异。

Result: 在五个不同领域的实验中，StyleDecipher在域内检测准确率上达到最先进水平，在跨域评估中比现有基线高出36.30%，对对抗扰动和混合内容保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model
surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation

Motivation: 大型语言模型对提示设计高度敏感，现有COSTAR框架在大型模型上表现良好，但在小型本地优化模型上输出一致性较差，特别是在需要更指令性或约束性输出的任务中。

Method: 在COSTAR（Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response）框架基础上增加'Answer'组件，形成COSTAR-A框架，并通过一系列受控的提示-输出评估测试其在小型（最多80亿参数）微调模型上的表现。

Result: COSTAR-A能提升本地化LLMs的输出结构和决策性，但其有效性因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型在使用COSTAR-A提示时相比单独使用COSTAR表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: 本文提出PARO框架，通过让LLMs学习任务特定的推理模式来自动生成推理轨迹，从而大幅减少对人类标注的需求，在数值语义匹配任务上达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的SFT+RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，本文旨在研究如何在不损害推理性能的前提下大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 提出PARO框架，识别模式化推理任务，让LLMs学习共享的推理模式，自动生成与任务特定推理模式对齐的推理轨迹，无需人工标注。

Result: 实验表明PARO生成的推理轨迹在SFT+RLVR性能上与10倍规模的人工标注相当，证明大规模人工标注可被有限监督的LLM自动标注替代。

Conclusion: 对于模式化推理任务，推理模式而非标注数量或质量是性能关键，LLM基于推理模式的自动标注可有效替代昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成任务中存在校准问题：创意任务输出过于同质化，事实任务产生多样化但错误的幻觉。这两种失败模式可以通过生成空间大小(GSS)概念统一解决。

Method: 构建GSSBench任务套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，评估不同指标，比较幻觉检测指标与标准多样性指标的表现。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标(特别是EigenScore)始终优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，仅使用模型内部状态即可提供对模型内部任务表示的可解释见解。

Conclusion: GSS概念能够统一处理LLM的两种失败模式，在检测提示歧义、解释推理行为、引导高质量多样化输出等方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上超越所有开源模型，性能媲美Gemini 2.5 Pro；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量细粒度描述，Omni-Cloze为全模态细粒度感知提供了稳定可靠的评估方法，推动了多模态AI的发展。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Motivation: 扩展语言模型对类型学常见语法偏好的研究，从两个角度改进：采用更贴近自然语言的广义范畴语法，并更关注模型对未见长句的泛化能力。

Method: 使用广义范畴语法构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构，评估语言模型对未见长句的处理能力。

Result: 类型学合理的词序更容易被语言模型进行生产性泛化。

Conclusion: 通过改进的人工语言构建和实验范式，更清晰地证明了语言模型对类型学常见语法结构的偏好，合理的词序更易被泛化。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为"自然度"概念主观且缺乏可扩展的定量指标。

Method: 提出DGRC方法：将对话分割为提示，使用语言模型生成子部分续写，重新组合对话和续写，比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续议题内容，指令调优模型此效应更强；当存在相关线索时，模型会降低议题偏好，这种模式反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能减轻语言模型分析中的偏见，系统测试话语敏感行为；指令调优虽未进一步放大调节能力，但模式体现了良好对话动态。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论的LLMs语言学评论过于推测性和无建设性，需要新的理论框架来理解和评估语言模型。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为所有口头和书面表达的总和，强调使用频率作为语言的主要支配原则。

Result: 基于Mańczak框架挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，为语言模型的设计、评估和解释提供了建设性指导。

Conclusion: 经验主义语言学视角能够更有效地理解和评估LLMs，频率原则应成为语言模型设计和分析的核心考量。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

*Ahmed Heakl,Martin Gubri,Salman Khan,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个可改造的动态层路由框架，通过轻量级路由器决定跳过、执行或重复Transformer层，在保持精度的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有Transformer层，导致简单查询计算浪费，复杂查询推理深度不足。现有自适应深度方法依赖昂贵推理时搜索、架构修改或大规模重训练，且往往牺牲精度。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)推导高质量层配置，在计算预算下保持或提高精度。采用窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器等技术处理类别不平衡和长序列。

Result: 在ARC(逻辑)和DART(数学)任务上，精度提升达+3.4%，平均每示例节省5层。路由器泛化到领域外任务，精度仅下降0.85%，同时保持效率，优于先前路由方法达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可以在不改变基础权重的情况下，为冻结的LLM提供预算感知、精度驱动的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Abstract: Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly
understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor.
This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce
high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low
literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language
of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native
proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53
hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of
human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory
conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline
and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles
undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

Motivation: 当前VR中3D内容物理操作技术存在工程密集、几何表示简化等问题，影响视觉保真度和物理准确性。需要更直观高效的交互方法。

Method: 将物体网格与高斯溅射表示直接集成，利用现有3D网格资产，采用物理引擎无关的架构设计。

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Coordinate Condensation方法，在坐标下降法中结合Schur补子空间校正来加速物理仿真，相比现有方法消除了阻尼问题，实现接近牛顿法的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如JGS2使用扰动子空间来考虑全局耦合，但引入了阻尼问题影响收敛速度，需要改进以消除这种阻尼。

Method: 在坐标下降法基础上，通过Schur补子空间校正来增强局部坐标更新，独立求解局部和子空间位移，消除阻尼问题。

Result: 在多种材料刚度和网格分辨率下测试，相比标准坐标下降法和JGS2方法，收敛速度显著提升，在子空间能充分捕捉全局耦合时达到接近牛顿法的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持坐标下降法效率和并行性的同时，显著提升了收敛速度，并分析了子空间坐标方法的适用条件，为未来求解器设计提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that
accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates
with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al.
2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for
global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade
convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace
displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the
subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton
convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate
descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh
resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard
coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based
coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design.

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM4GTA框架，通过保持图与文本表示之间的适当差距来避免过对齐问题，从而提升跨模态表示学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度强调图与文本表示的相似性，导致预训练知识结构被破坏和泛化能力下降。图编码器和文本编码器在几何上不兼容，过对齐会压缩不同的表示空间，造成结构坍塌。

Method: 提出LLM4GTA框架，包含自适应差距保持模块（监控相似性演化防止过对齐）和图空间内模态补偿机制（使用辅助分类器增强判别能力）。

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景下，相比现有方法取得了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 保持表示差距是维持模态特定知识和提升迁移性能的几何必要条件，LLM4GTA框架有效解决了过对齐问题。

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates
structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in
diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to
maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and
text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical
analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction
result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge
structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric
incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological
patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment
compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure
collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding.
We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves
representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific
knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap
preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity
evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative
power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show
significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多层次的草图表示方案和SDGraph深度学习架构，通过三个层次（草图级、笔画级、点级）系统识别和利用草图中的有效信息，在分类、检索和矢量草图生成任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手绘草图具有独特的稀疏性和抽象性，需要不同于图像的学习方法。现有研究对草图中有效信息的定义有限，制约了现有方法的性能。

Method: 首先提出多级草图表示方案，将草图表示分为三个层次。然后开发SDGraph架构，包含稀疏图（以笔画为节点）和稠密图（以点为节点）两个互补模块，通过图卷积和上下采样操作进行编码和解码，并通过信息融合模块增强特征提取。

Result: 在分类任务上比现有最优方法提升1.15%，检索任务提升1.70%，矢量草图生成质量提升36.58%。

Conclusion: 通过系统识别草图中的有效信息并设计相应的深度学习架构，能够显著提升草图相关任务的性能，证明了多级表示方案的有效性。

Abstract: Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating
learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning
methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information
embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes
effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of
existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level
Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective
information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:
sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the
granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine
(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch
information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental
evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the
above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to
exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph
comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as
nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense
Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level
representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with
down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both
encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two
graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of
sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and
1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,
and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor是一个用于ICU死亡率预测的框架，通过原型学习实现内在可解释性，整合了临床病程识别、人口异质性和预后意识三个ICU决策实践的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU死亡率预测不仅需要预测准确性，还需要可解释性来建立临床信任和满足监管标准。现有方法主要关注人口异质性，忽视了临床病程识别和预后意识。

Method: ProtoDoctor包含两个关键创新模块：预后临床病程识别模块（通过原型学习识别临床病程，使用新的正则化机制实现预后意识）和人口异质性识别模块（通过队列特定原型和风险调整建模人口异质性）。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于最先进的基线方法。人工评估进一步证实其解释在临床实践中更具意义、可信度和适用性。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor成功整合了ICU决策实践的三个关键要素，在保持高预测准确性的同时提供了临床上有意义的解释，为ICU死亡率预测提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

TL;DR: GraphShaper是一个几何感知的图基础模型框架，通过多几何专业化增强图编码，解决现有方法在结构边界处性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的图表示学习方法假设所有图结构都可以在单一欧几里得空间中编码，但实际上树结构需要双曲几何来保持层次分支，而循环模式依赖球面几何来保持闭合特性。在结构边界处，节点会经历冲突的几何约束，导致性能下降超过20个百分点。

Method: GraphShaper采用针对不同几何空间的专家网络，动态计算融合权重，根据局部结构特征自适应地整合几何属性。这种自适应融合在文本嵌入对齐之前保持结构完整性。

Result: 在零样本设置下，GraphShaper在引文网络上实现了9.47%的准确率提升，在社交网络上实现了7.63%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GraphShaper通过几何感知的多几何专业化框架，有效解决了图结构边界处的性能退化问题，显著提升了图表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 当前基于固定问题集的强化学习方法训练效率低，难以处理复杂问题。需要一种能够动态调整问题难度以适应求解器能力的方法。

Method: GAR框架：生成对抗强化学习，将问题生成器和求解器在对抗循环中联合训练，引入隐式课程学习机制，使任务难度与证明者能力同步演进。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上，Goedel-Prover-V2-8B和DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B的pass@32平均相对提升4.20%；DeepSeek-Prover-V2在ProofNet-Test上的pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR不仅提升了形式化证明的性能，还建立了一个通用的强化学习范式，适用于可验证环境下的问题生成与求解协同进化。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出H4G框架，通过降低双曲空间中的嵌入半径来解决现有方法在异配图上的过抽象问题，显著提升了零样本图学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本属性图方法在需要细粒度模式识别的任务上表现不佳，特别是在异配图上。通过实证和理论分析发现存在过抽象问题，即当前方法在过大的双曲半径下操作，将多尺度结构信息压缩成统一的高层抽象，导致关键局部模式丢失。

Method: 提出H4G框架，使用可学习的块对角缩放矩阵和Möbius矩阵乘法系统性地降低嵌入半径，在保持全局感知能力的同时恢复对细粒度模式的访问，计算开销最小。

Result: H4G在异配图上实现了12.8%的零样本性能提升，在同配图上实现了8.4%的提升，达到最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 半径减小能够实现忠实的多尺度表示，推动零样本图学习的发展，证明了在双曲空间中保持细粒度结构细节的重要性。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典薛定谔桥问题(SBP)在生成式AI中有重要应用，但其硬终端约束在高维或数据稀缺情况下会导致实现不稳定，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用软约束薛定谔桥问题框架，将终端约束替换为一般惩罚函数，建立更灵活的McKean-Vlasov型随机控制公式。

Result: 证明了所有惩罚水平下最优解的存在性，并证明随着惩罚增加，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP的解。

Conclusion: 软约束方法不仅提供了首个软约束桥的定量收敛保证，还揭示了惩罚正则化如何实现鲁棒的生成建模、微调和迁移学习。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Motivation: 现有测量数据影响的方法在大模型上不实用，要么近似效果差，要么计算成本过高，需要梯度和逆Hessian计算，难以扩展。

Method: 使用零阶近似方法，仅依赖训练和测试数据在中间检查点上的损失值以及检查点本身，无需梯度或Hessian计算。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型提供了可扩展且实用的训练数据分析工具，能够有效理解训练数据如何塑造模型行为。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Boundary Guidance方法，通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其远离安全分类器的决策边界，从而同时提高输出的安全性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被安全分类器过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了误报和漏报。

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成过程远离分类器的决策边界。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM-as-a-Judge评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 在不同模型规模和奖励设计下的全面消融实验证明了该方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一种新颖的扩散模型框架，通过在小波系数上训练来利用时间序列数据的多分辨率结构，在多个真实世界数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列生成模型局限于时域或频域，难以再现真实世界时间序列固有的多尺度结构，而大型高质量时间序列数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 在小波系数上训练扩散模型，结合各分解层的专用transformer和跨层注意力机制，通过自适应门控实现时频尺度间的选择性信息交换，并基于Parseval定理加入能量保持约束。

Result: 在能源、金融和神经科学等六个真实世界数据集上的测试表明，WaveletDiff在五个不同性能指标上始终优于最先进的时域和频域生成方法，判别分数和Context-FID分数平均比第二佳基线小3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff通过利用小波域的多分辨率结构，有效解决了时间序列生成中的多尺度挑战，在多个领域展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Motivation: 语言模型适应新任务时面临基本权衡：既要学习新能力，又要避免灾难性遗忘现有知识。现有研究对计算约束下平衡任务性能和知识保留的最佳重放比例理解不足。

Method: 使用bAbI推理任务作为目标，应用合成数据生成技术，系统评估不同总token预算和重放比例配置，分析它们对任务掌握和通用知识保留的影响。

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的重放比例选择指南，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应能力。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Motivation: 利用开源视觉语言模型的新进展来理解复杂主观的多模态现象（如讽刺），评估模型在零样本、单样本和少样本提示下的讽刺检测和解释生成能力。

Method: 使用7种最先进的视觉语言模型（BLIP2、InstructBLIP、OpenFlamingo、LLaVA、PaliGemma、Gemma3、Qwen-VL），在三个基准讽刺数据集（Muse、MMSD2.0、SarcNet）上进行零样本、单样本和少样本提示评估。

Result: 当前模型在二元讽刺检测方面取得中等成功，但在生成高质量解释方面表现不佳，需要任务特定微调才能生成突出视觉-文本不一致性的解释。

Conclusion: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态讽刺检测方面取得进展，但在生成人类质量水平的解释方面仍有局限，需要进一步的任务特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于流程通常是资源驱动的，理解和纳入参与者行为对于预测至关重要，但现有研究中参与者行为作为时变信号的作用仍然有限。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建包含TT和参与者中心特征的多变量时间序列，包括参与者参与度、继续、中断和交接行为的频率及持续时间，训练并比较多个模型。

Result: 包含参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上始终优于仅包含TT特征的基线模型。

Conclusion: 将参与者行为建模为时间序列并纳入预测模型能够显著提高性能指标预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种将显式负陈述整合到知识嵌入学习中的新方法，使用双模型架构分别训练正负陈述，通过相互评分选择负样本，在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图嵌入方法大多依赖封闭世界假设，将缺失三元组视为假，这与现实世界的开放世界假设不符。显式负陈述能帮助区分假三元组和未知三元组，但很少被包含在知识图中且在嵌入训练中被忽视。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个嵌入模型并行训练：一个在正陈述上训练，另一个在负陈述上训练。训练过程中，每个模型通过破坏正样本生成负样本，并使用另一个模型的评分选择最可能的候选样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图上的广泛实验表明，该方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务中提高了预测性能，优于最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 将有意义负知识整合到嵌入学习中具有价值，能显著提升知识图嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

TL;DR: 提出CART框架，首次增强决策变换器在对抗性随机游戏中的鲁棒性，通过阶段博弈建模和NashQ值条件化，实现对抗鲁棒性和保守性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer已应用于序列决策，但基于序列建模的强化学习方法在对抗鲁棒性方面尚未充分探索，需要解决决策变换器在对抗环境中的脆弱性问题。

Method: 将每个阶段的交互建模为阶段博弈，定义基于后续状态期望最大值的收益函数，通过从阶段博弈推导的NashQ值条件化Transformer策略。

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更精确的最小最大值估计，并在各种环境下持续获得更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART框架成功增强了决策变换器的对抗鲁棒性，通过结合阶段博弈和NashQ值条件化，在对抗环境中表现出色。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒强化学习方法依赖计算昂贵的嵌套min-max优化，导致策略过于保守，需要更高效的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用双层优化：下层在固定秩约束下优化策略，上层自适应调整秩来平衡偏差-方差权衡，将策略参数投影到低秩流形上。

Result: 在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试中，AdaRL不仅优于固定秩基线和最先进的鲁棒RL方法，还能收敛到任务的内在秩。

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示为模型不确定性下的鲁棒强化学习提供了高效且原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有研究通常将个人事件（序列建模）和关系事件（图建模）分开处理，但现实系统需要同时捕获这两种事件类型。缺乏包含两种事件的公共数据集和预测任务。

Method: 引入包含个人和关系事件的数据集集合，提出统一的形式化表示方法，通过实验验证结合两种事件类型的有效性。

Result: 实证结果表明，模型从结合两种事件类型中获益，同时当前方法仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 发布了相关资源以支持统一用户事件建模的进一步研究，鼓励该方向的发展。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法对环境动态、信道传播特性和硬件异构性高度敏感，需要大量人工校准且性能容易退化。

Method: 通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上微调LLM，Locaris学习从原始信号直接映射到设备位置的轻量级通用映射。

Conclusion: 紧凑型LLM可作为室内定位的校准自由回归模型，在大规模部署中提供可扩展和稳健的跨环境性能。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Result: 在多种不同环境中实现了接近最优的实证性能，相比RestartQ-UCB将动态遗憾降低了高达91%

Conclusion: 所提出的三种重启范式能有效解决非平稳强化学习中的重启设计问题，显著提升算法性能

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to

Conclusion: 该工作为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Result: 在合成、图像和生物学数据集上，Y流恢复了层次感知结构，改进了基于流的强基线的分布度量，并以更少的积分步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支机制有效捕捉数据中的层次结构，提高了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff是一个新颖的扩散模型加速框架，通过轨迹感知的结构化剪枝将扩散预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在不同的学习速度阶段，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一特性。

Method: 采用自适应剪枝机制：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的实验表明，该方法在不影响输出质量的情况下显著加速采样，大幅超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

TL;DR: 提出了QLENS框架，将Transformer的生成过程建模为量子力学系统，通过将隐藏层重新定义为幺正算子和哈密顿量，为理解模型内部机制提供物理视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer理解方法缺乏数学框架来建模各层如何促进状态转换，受跨学科成功启发，利用量子力学与语言模型概率特性的相似性来建立描述性框架。

Method: 将Transformer的潜在激活转换为希尔伯特空间中的状态向量，将隐藏层重新定义为幺正算子和哈密顿量，最终概率分布通过玻恩规则和特定测量算子获得。

Result: 通过玩具Transformer的概念验证，展示了QLENS能够探究各层在模型预测轨迹中的影响。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域洞察提供了基础，有助于更广泛地理解Transformer模型。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段的视觉语言模型对齐方法，通过温和负样本的监督微调和基于冷却权重的DPO优化，解决了传统偏好微调中梯度不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于偏好的视觉语言模型微调很脆弱，琐碎的错误负样本会产生无信息梯度，导致训练不稳定。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用温和负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段在DPO目标中应用冷却权重来抑制无信息梯度。

Result: CW-DPO在多种VLM任务中实现了更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的成对胜率，且收敛步数更少。

Conclusion: 在冷却偏好之前平滑学习动态是稳健VLM对齐的简单通用原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Conclusion: 揭示了神经动力学中相变与学习性能的强关联，为生物可信学习提供了新方法，并提出了皮层启发的自耦合替代方案。

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Motivation: 探索二阶方法作为一阶优化器（如梯度下降和ADAM）的替代方案在神经网络训练中的潜力，特别是比较精确Hessian与近似Hessian的效果差异。

Method: 通过实验比较使用精确二阶信息（真实Hessian矩阵）和近似二阶信息（拟牛顿法）在神经网络训练中的表现。

Result: 使用精确曲率信息训练神经网络会可靠地失败，而拟牛顿法等近似二阶方法表现更好。失败模式揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性以及损失函数中驻点的分布。

Conclusion: 研究结果质疑了损失函数充满局部最小值的传统观点，表明精确二阶信息的失败提供了对损失函数几何结构的新见解。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

TL;DR: 该论文从理论上分析了Mamba模型的上下文学习能力，证明其在低维非线性目标函数任务中能够通过测试时特征学习实现高效的上下文学习，其样本复杂度优于线性Transformer，与非线性Transformer相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为一种线性时间序列模型，虽然计算效率高且实证表现优秀，但其底层机制的理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在从理论上分析Mamba的上下文学习能力。

Method: 研究Mamba在单索引模型y≈g*(⟨β,x⟩)上的上下文学习，其中β是相关特征方向。通过基于梯度的预训练方法，分析Mamba如何通过测试时特征学习提取相关方向。

Result: 证明Mamba能够实现高效的上下文学习，其测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer（表现为核方法），与非线性Transformer相当，能够超越CSQ下界并接近信息理论最优速率。

Conclusion: Mamba的非线性门控机制在特征提取中起关键作用，这是Mamba能够同时实现计算效率和高性能的根本驱动力。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Conclusion: VAR基生成分类器为研究生成分类器提供了新视角，具有计算高效、可解释性强等独特优势

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Motivation: 现有深度学习睡眠分期模型在未见受试者上泛化能力差，主要由于生理信号的变异性导致领域外性能下降。现有对比学习方法未能充分提取领域不变特征，因为它们没有明确处理样本间未共享信息中的领域特征。

Method: 提出MEASURE框架，通过多尺度最小充分表示学习来减少领域相关信息，同时保留睡眠分期分类所需的关键时频特征。该方法避免在高层次信息上过度拟合特征，充分利用多特征层次中编码的多样化时频信息。

Conclusion: MEASURE框架通过有效减少领域相关信息同时保留关键时频特征，显著提升了睡眠分期模型在未见领域上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

Method: 基于奇异学习理论构建分阶段数据归因框架，通过玩具模型和语言模型验证影响关系的动态变化。

Result: 发现影响关系会发生非单调变化，包括符号翻转和在发展过渡期的急剧峰值，这些变化与模型学习语义层次结构的进程直接对应。

Conclusion: 神经网络训练过程中样本间影响关系是动态变化的，这种变化反映了模型学习语义层次结构的发展阶段。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Conclusion: 动态稀疏训练策略与架构改进相辅相成，模块特定训练框架MST能有效利用架构改进的效益，在多样化RL算法中实现可扩展性增益。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

TL;DR: 提出了Chimera模型，通过状态空间模型直接整合数据拓扑结构，无需领域特定的偏置，在语言、视觉和图数据上均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法依赖自注意力机制，将数据视为无序集合，忽略了数据的邻域结构或图拓扑，需要设计任务特定的偏置（如位置嵌入、随机游走）来融入拓扑信息，但这需要大量工作且可能引入副作用。

Method: 将状态空间模型推广到能够捕获任意图拓扑，通过算法优化：对于有向无环图实现线性时间递归，对于一般图通过数学松弛达到Transformer的二次复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE上比BERT高0.7分，在ImageNet-1k上比ViT高2.6%，在长程图基准测试中优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 验证了数据拓扑是跨模态的强大归纳偏置，Chimera的核心贡献得到支持。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Conclusion: nuGPR框架通过数值线性代数技术有效解决了GPR训练的计算瓶颈，在大规模数据集上实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Result: 实验表明，即使在FL系统中只有一个恶意客户端，攻击也能将偏见增加高达90%，且能对抗最先进的拜占庭鲁棒和公平感知聚合方案。

Conclusion: 提出的公平性攻击具有隐蔽性且难以检测，在保持全局准确性的同时显著增加偏见，对联邦学习系统的安全性构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Conclusion: 预算学习在生存数据分析中具有实际应用价值，能够有效利用有限预算获取更多信息来改进生存预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析大型语言模型中的反思机制如何贡献于性能提升，特别是在发现LLM在思维链中检测错误能力有限的情况下，反思机制的实际效果尚不明确。

Method: 设计了一个简约的推理框架，支持小型Transformer进行基本的自我验证反思，避免使用自然语言以确保分析清晰度，并降低全面实验成本。

Result: 实验表明，仅有几百万参数的小型Transformer在训练和反思执行中都能从自我验证中受益，在整数乘法和数独任务中达到与大型语言模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 将生成式Transformer与判别式验证相结合，本质上促进了思维链推理，这种效果与模型规模和自然语言无关。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文对元学习样本重加权方法在标签噪声下的训练动态进行了理论分析，揭示了其三个训练阶段，并提出了一种轻量级替代方法，在噪声标签基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元学习样本重加权方法虽然能利用少量干净样本来缓解标签噪声问题，但其行为机制和训练动态缺乏理论理解，需要深入分析以改进方法。

Method: 首先对元重加权方法进行严格理论分析，揭示其三个训练阶段；然后基于分析提出轻量级替代方法，集成均值中心化、行移位和标签符号调制，避免昂贵的双层优化。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签基准测试中，提出的方法在性能稳定性方面优于现有的重加权/选择基线方法。

Conclusion: 元重加权的训练动态可分为对齐、过滤和后过滤三个阶段，其机制依赖于训练信号与干净子集信号的相似性加权耦合；提出的轻量级替代方法能提供更稳定的性能。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Conclusion: DE3S框架通过精确识别形状，有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的准确性与早期性冲突问题，在保持高准确性的同时实现早期预测。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Result: 实现了竞争性的一步生成性能，并通过谱分析提供了解释和操作生成过程的原理机制。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Motivation: Graph-LLM在整合图结构和文本语义时存在安全漏洞，现有攻击方法只针对单一维度，缺乏统一的多维度攻击框架。

Method: IMDGA框架包含三个紧密集成的模块，协调执行图结构和文本特征的多层次扰动，平衡可解释性和攻击效果。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实证评估显示，IMDGA在可解释性、攻击效果、隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了Graph-LLM中先前未被充分探索的语义维度漏洞，为提升其韧性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and
resources are publicly available at

Conclusion: MoRA通过实例特定的动态适配，在保持LLM核心知识的同时有效整合分子图结构，为药物发现提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Motivation: 在执行性学习中，数据分布会响应部署的模型（如用户策略性调整特征），这比传统监督学习更复杂。需要同时优化当前数据上的模型性能，并考虑模型可能引导分布变化的方向。

Method: 通过研究高维岭回归中的正则化影响，分析执行性效应如何改变测试风险，并确定最优正则化参数与执行性效应强度的关系。

Result: 执行性效应在总体设置中恶化测试风险，但在过参数化情况下可能有益。最优正则化强度与执行性效应整体强度成比例，可以据此设置正则化参数。

Conclusion: 正则化可以帮助应对执行性效应，特别是在过参数化情况下，通过适当设置正则化参数可以预期执行性效应的影响。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

Conclusion: HiLoRA提供了一种无需训练的高效LoRA复用方法，通过分层路由机制显著提升了领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

*Florent Delgrange,Raphael Avalos,Willem Röpke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DeepSPI算法，将安全策略改进从离线表格强化学习扩展到在线深度强化学习，通过限制策略更新在定义邻域内确保单调改进和收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全策略改进理论主要关注离线表格强化学习，本文旨在研究在线设置下结合世界模型和表示学习的安全策略改进。

Method: 开发理论框架，将策略更新限制在当前策略的明确定义邻域内，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新，提出DeepSPI算法。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI匹配或超越了PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 成功将安全策略改进理论扩展到在线深度强化学习，通过理论框架和DeepSPI算法实现了性能提升和理论保证的结合。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Motivation: 准确预测极端降雨事件对气候学和地球系统具有重要意义，传统机器学习模型在极端事件预测方面存在局限。

Method: 使用图注意力网络与LSTM结合，基于地形降水物理公式构建初始边特征，并采用空间季节感知的广义帕累托分布进行极值分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为长期水资源管理决策提供了实用的精细化地图生成方案，显著改善了极端降雨事件的预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

TL;DR: 首次对具有演化奖励函数的单时间尺度actor-critic算法在马尔可夫采样下进行有限时间收敛分析，证明了在奖励参数缓慢变化时仍能达到O(1/√T)收敛速率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实用的强化学习算法使用演化奖励函数（如奖励塑形、熵正则化、课程学习），但其理论基础尚未充分发展

Method: 分析单时间尺度actor-critic算法在马尔可夫采样下的收敛性，考虑奖励参数随时间变化影响策略优化和价值估计

Result: 在标准假设下，推导了actor和critic误差的非渐近界，证明当奖励参数演化足够慢时，可实现O(1/√T)收敛速率，与静态奖励的最佳已知速率匹配

Conclusion: 为许多流行的RL技术提供了理论基础，同时在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配分析，将最佳已知速率提高了log²T倍

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: 提出基于TSP的令牌重排序策略和误差修正后处理，解决同态加密下LLM文本生成的挑战，提升生成质量并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与LLM交互，需要安全加密通信。同态加密虽然支持加密数据计算，但文本生成特别是下一个令牌预测仍是关键障碍。

Method: 采用基于TSP的令牌重排序策略来处理加密文本生成的困难，并添加后处理步骤进一步减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止崩溃，提高生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模组织中确保数据质量面临挑战，传统错误检测方法主要关注单一模态（如表），容易忽略电商、医疗等领域中常见的跨模态错误。

Method: 在表格数据上进行跨模态错误检测基准测试，评估了四种数据集和五种基线方法，重点关注Cleanlab和DataScope与AutoML框架的组合。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在结合强AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得了最高的F1分数，但整体方法在处理重尾真实世界数据时仍有不足。

Conclusion: 当前跨模态错误检测方法仍有局限性，特别是在处理真实世界重尾数据时，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Motivation: 现有GNN预训练方法主要针对同质图设计，而现实图大多是异质的，且存在语义不匹配问题（原始数据与理想可迁移语义信息数据之间的差异）。

Method: 设计结构感知预训练任务捕获异构图结构特性；构建语义邻居组成的扰动子空间来处理语义不匹配，使模型更关注语义空间中的通用知识。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效预训练异构图GNN，通过结构感知和语义感知任务解决语义不匹配问题，提升模型的可迁移性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [210] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的权重衰减方法，只在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时才应用权重衰减，无需额外超参数调优，在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中能持续提升最终损失和准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦权重衰减会隐式优化正则化或约束目标，而CWD旨在保持原始损失函数不变，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优平稳点。

Method: CWD是一种一行代码的修改，仅对参数坐标符号与优化器更新方向一致的部分应用权重衰减，具有双层优化解释，在达到平稳流形时诱导滑动模式行为。

Result: 在百万到十亿参数规模的语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务中，CWD持续改善了最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD是AdamW、Lion和Muon等优化器的即插即用改进，无需新超参数或额外调优，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Motivation: 当前用于评估晶体材料生成模型的传统距离函数存在四个主要问题：无法量化相似度、不能区分成分和结构差异、缺乏对原子坐标变化的连续性、以及独特性指标对样本排列不具不变性。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数来评估生成模型的独特性和新颖性，这些函数理论上克服了传统距离函数的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新提出的距离函数能够揭示传统距离函数遗漏的洞见，为评估和比较无机晶体生成模型提供了更可靠的基础。

Conclusion: 连续距离函数为晶体材料生成模型的评估提供了更准确和可靠的方法，有助于更好地解决气候变化等科学挑战。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法通常假设需求函数具有特定参数形式，这在现实场景中可能不成立，限制了方法的适用性。需要一种不依赖严格建模假设的方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程对需求函数进行非参数建模，将其视为价格的未知黑盒函数，基于贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，适用于无限和有限库存两种场景。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，基于贝叶斯优化的方法在收入方面优于多种最先进的强化学习算法，需要更少假设且具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境中动态定价的强大实用工具，能够有效学习未知需求函数并实现更好的定价策略。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化能力的关系，发现尖锐最小值在正则化下往往能带来更好的泛化性能、校准性、鲁棒性和功能一致性，挑战了平坦最小值必然对应更好泛化的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化能力相关，但近期研究发现了理论反例和实证例外。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐性在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）下模型收敛的几何特性。

Result: 发现正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好；而无正则化的基线模型收敛到更平坦的最小值但性能更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度本身决定了解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可能反映了更合适的归纳偏置，需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Motivation: 扩散模型在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现不佳，而现有的桥匹配方法未探索时间相关数据序列的应用，这对需要保持时间一致性的视频任务至关重要。

Method: TCVBM框架扩展桥匹配到时间相关视频序列，在扩散桥中显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性直接融入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率三个任务中，TCVBM在多个定量指标上均优于基于桥匹配和扩散模型的经典方法。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过建模时间相关性，在视频任务中实现了更好的生成质量和重建保真度，为时间相关数据序列的桥匹配应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模多尺度信息时往往独立处理或简单融合，忽略了异常期间跨尺度关联的动态变化，且基于固定滑动窗口限制了上下文信息的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出跨尺度重构方法，从粗粒度序列重构细粒度序列以显式捕捉跨尺度关联；设计查询库并融入全局多尺度上下文来克服固定窗口大小的限制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上使用九种评估指标进行广泛实验，验证了CrossAD的有效性，在异常检测方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CrossAD框架通过考虑跨尺度关联和跨窗口建模，在时间序列异常检测中表现出优越性能，解决了现有方法在多尺度建模中的局限性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济发展，组织间数据协作需求增长，但隐私问题使直接数据共享不可行。现有两方分割学习（垂直联邦学习）存在计算资源利用率低、训练效率差的问题，特别是同步依赖设计增加训练延迟，参与方资源与数据异构性阻碍高效计算。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL通过创新的发布/订阅架构有效解决了垂直联邦学习中的效率和资源利用问题，实现了高效、安全的协作学习。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Conclusion: 噪声偏移是扩散模型中的一个系统性偏差问题，NAG提供了一种简单有效的校正方法，能够改善模型的分布外泛化和去噪更新准确性。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中需要公平收入分配的问题，特别是在存在上下文变化的情况下，确保每个选项获得最低保障奖励的同时优化整体性能。

Method: 设计了两种算法：乐观优先性能的算法和悲观强制约束满足的算法，解决了跨上下文聚合最小奖励约束带来的技术挑战。

Result: 为每种算法推导了问题相关的遗憾和约束违反上界，并建立了下界证明时间依赖关系的最优性，揭示了先前工作中自由探索原则的基本局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有跨上下文最小奖励约束的多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的算法解决方案，并建立了理论保证，揭示了此类问题的基本限制。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Method: 使用假设检验、对照组和随机控制蒸馏，分析多种蒸馏变体和模型规模下的蒸馏缩放规律。

Result: 在某些模态和架构中存在统计显著的知识转移，但程度低于预期；显著知识转移时存在严重的负面知识不对称转移。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器，具有负面不对称回报，而非压缩机制，存在安全担忧。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过解耦变量发现和动力学拟合，利用预训练FIMs实现了稳定高效的粗粒化表示学习

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了元主动特征获取（meta-AFA）问题和Learning-to-Measure（L2M）方法，通过跨任务学习特征获取策略，在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下优于任务特定基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动特征获取方法通常针对单一预定任务，限制了可扩展性。实际应用中，模型需要从具有系统性特征缺失和有限任务特定标签的回顾性数据中学习。

Method: L2M包含：i）对未见任务的可靠不确定性量化，ii）基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取代理，最大化条件互信息。采用序列建模或自回归预训练方法支持任意缺失模式下的不确定性量化。

Result: 在合成和真实表格基准测试中，L2M匹配或超越任务特定基线，特别是在标签稀缺和高缺失率情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: L2M直接在具有回顾性缺失的数据集上操作，无需每任务重新训练，实现了跨任务的元主动特征获取，解决了传统方法的可扩展性限制。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Method: 提出Laminar系统：1）用中继工作者层替代全局更新，实现分布式参数服务；2）动态重新打包机制将长尾轨迹整合到专用rollout上；3）完全解耦架构隔离故障。

Conclusion: 通过轨迹级异步和完全解耦架构，Laminar能够有效解决RL后训练中的可扩展性问题，显著提升训练效率和系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集质量差异很大，但事先难以评估。现有方法需要训练智能体才能判断数据集质量，这在实际应用中效率低下。需要一种无需训练就能评估数据集质量的代理指标。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上的实验表明，BWD与离线RL算法性能的oracle评分强相关，能有效预测标准智能体在给定数据集上的表现。将BWD作为正则化器集成到策略优化中，能显式地将学习策略推离随机行为并提高回报。

Conclusion: 价值感知的分布信号如BWD是离线RL数据集筛选和策略优化的实用工具，为离线强化学习提供了有效的数据质量评估方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Conclusion: 当前混合思维存在局限性，本文为增强其可控性提供了方向和实用方案。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过联合建模原始和目标条件特征视图，并结合自适应噪声过滤机制，实现了更鲁棒的表格数据深度学习模型。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Conclusion: 将基于核心集的聚类理论与谱稀疏化联系起来，证明在强聚类性条件下，即使均匀采样也具有结构感知能力，为均匀边采样在结构保持谱聚类中的适用性提供了首个可证明保证。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Result: CALM减少了有害输出，在大多数指标上优于基线方法，仅带来较小的计算开销。

Conclusion: CALM提供了一种轻量级的AI安全方法，无需额外训练数据或模型微调。

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent
representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging
\gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection,
CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while
preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful
outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a
lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

TL;DR: 提出了CoRA框架，通过Granger因果嵌入和零初始化条件注入机制，让时间序列基础模型能够有效整合多模态外生协变量，提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型大多在单变量时间序列上预训练，无法充分利用现实预测任务中多模态协变量的关键信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: CoRA框架保持基础模型骨干网络冻结作为特征提取器，使用Granger因果嵌入自动评估协变量的因果预测能力，通过零初始化条件注入机制逐步整合外生信息。

Result: 实验表明CoRA在协变量感知预测任务上实现了31.1%的MSE降低，在少样本和全样本训练下均优于现有方法，且与多种先进TSFM兼容。

Conclusion: CoRA为时间序列基础模型的应用提供了实用范式，能够有效整合多模态协变量，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀疏和标注稀缺问题，在异常停靠检测任务上取得了优异性能，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的词嵌入层参数众多，导致存储需求大和内存占用高，特别是在边缘设备上成为内存瓶颈。压缩嵌入层可以释放内存带宽并加速推理。

Method: 提出CARVQ方法，结合线性非线性映射的组合，通过校正适配器和分组残差向量量化来压缩嵌入层，无需专用硬件支持低比特存储。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-1B、LLaMA-3.2-3B、Qwen2.5-7B等多个模型上测试，在生成、判别、数学和推理任务中，CARVQ能实现更低的平均比特率，同时保持合理的困惑度和准确率。

Conclusion: CARVQ是与最先进变换器量化方法兼容的新型压缩技术，可无缝集成到支持4位内存的任何硬件中，是实现LLM在边缘设备高效部署的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Motivation: 决策树学习算法通常包含启发式局部搜索操作，但缺乏对这些操作计算复杂度的系统分析。研究旨在确定哪些问题特性导致计算困难，哪些特性使问题可解。

Method: 采用参数化复杂度分析方法，研究在固定操作次数下最小化分类错误的问题。特别关注特征数量d和域大小D的组合影响。

Result: 发现当特征数量d或域大小D单独较小时问题仍然困难，但两者组合时问题变得固定参数可解，并给出了$(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$时间复杂度的算法。

Conclusion: 通过参数化复杂度分析揭示了决策树局部搜索问题的计算特性，证明了特征数量和域大小的组合是决定问题可解性的关键因素，并提供了有效的算法实现。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Motivation: 传统变量重要性方法依赖单一模型和观测特征，但特征重要性受其他变量影响且重要变量常缺失，同时Rashomon效应导致不同模型估计的变量重要性不同。

Result: 理论证明了方法的鲁棒性，在半合成模拟中表现良好，并在信用风险任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE提供了一种处理缺失特征和Rashomon效应的稳健变量重要性分析方法。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Conclusion: KoALA是一种轻量级、即插即用的对抗检测解决方案，适用于现有模型和多种数据模态，无需架构修改或对抗训练。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

Motivation: 现有多决策者预测方法存在样本复杂度不优或预测器复杂的问题，需要设计更高效的算法来同时最小化多个损失函数。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）通过在线到批处理的转换获得样本高效但复杂的随机化预测器；2）利用适当损失函数的结构特性设计更直接的确定性算法。

Conclusion: 通过利用适当损失函数的结构特性，可以设计出比现有方法更直接、非随机化的高效预测算法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights

Method: 提出少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，利用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏见。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序的代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，比14个最先进LLM的最佳集成性能提升2倍。

Conclusion: 基于回归的方法能有效缓解LLM评估器的正向偏见问题，显著提高评估精度。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL)来解决AI智能体评估中的挑战，包括标准化评估框架、三维分析和LLM辅助日志检查，旨在推动从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响对智能体真实性能的理解，需要更全面可靠的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架，在数百个VM上并行评估；2. 三维分析涵盖模型、框架和基准；3. LLM辅助日志检查发现未报告行为。

Result: 执行了21,730次智能体运行，覆盖9个模型和9个基准，发现意外洞察如更高推理努力反而降低准确性，并识别出智能体在任务中的异常行为。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估方法和解决常见评估陷阱，HAL旨在推动AI智能体研究从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的基准测试，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据构建，测试模型在证据提取、强度判断和结果分类方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因变异解释方法耗时费力，需要自动化工具来加速临床转化研究。现有基准测试过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个关键任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类和描述实验结果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面显示出潜力但存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层解释上更优。模型经常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型思想的两阶段训练方法，让LLM学会通过顺序提问来有效获取用户偏好信息，特别是在用户历史有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统中，当用户历史信息有限时，需要通过与用户的开放式对话来获取偏好信息。生成有效的顺序澄清问题是一个挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：正向过程从用户档案生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案（添加"噪声"）；反向过程训练模型通过提问来"去噪"用户档案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段训练方法能够有效提升LLM在推荐系统中通过顺序提问获取用户偏好的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境不仅需要准确预测，还需要对过程异常、根本原因和潜在干预提供可解释的见解。现有AI系统往往作为孤立的黑盒运行，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: CausalTrace采用神经符号因果分析方法，结合工业本体和知识图谱进行数据驱动的因果分析，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根因分析，并允许实时操作员交互。

Result: 在学术火箭装配测试中，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），根因分析性能优异（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92），在C3AN评估中获得4.59/5分，展示了实时部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功地将预测、解释和因果推理集成到统一的决策支持解决方案中，为工业环境提供了透明、可解释且可信的AI系统，显著提升了在制造环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合约遵循性的框架，通过扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，引入合约违反测试用例来系统评估代码的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了真实软件中合约遵循性这一关键方面，导致无法衡量模型生成代码的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 构建专注于合约违反的测试套件语料库，扩展现有基准；系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成；引入新颖指标量化合约遵循性。

Result: 研究表明，在提示中增加合约违反测试用例能显著提升模型对合约的遵循能力，相比仅使用合约描述效果更好。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，为评估LLM生成代码的功能性和合约遵循性提供了严谨且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文，跨事件泛化能力差，可解释性有限；大语言模型虽具备少样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知

Method: 开发地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测数据自动检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，生成带单位注释的感知脚本

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估，地理空间接地的智能体表现优于基线模型，能够生成基于证据的资源分配建议

Conclusion: 该框架可推广到洪水、飓风等其他灾害类型，为灾害响应提供更智能的决策支持

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理能力的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes指令，显著提升模型性能、安全性和指令遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和目标偏离的问题。现有免训练方法要么依赖僵硬的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes指令，这些指令在推理行为分类学的驱动下演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率与推理长度的权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强指令遵循能力，还能与现有基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。通过自动识别和激发这些行为，ThinkPilot提供了一个可推广的框架来使模型推理与任务需求对齐。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否解决任何可计算任务，以及学习推理的关键因素——是模型规模还是训练数据规模。

Method: 将AI智能体重新定义为计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习范式，关注算法结构而非数据分布，并分析时间在推理中的关键作用。

Result: 理论推导出推理时间与训练时间的幂律缩放关系，证明大模型在无限资源下可能成为缺乏洞察力的"专家"，仅能暴力求解任务。

Conclusion: 扩展推理模型时应优化时间而非准确性，时间在学习中的关键作用尚未得到充分重视，这是实现真正智能的关键因素。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标签的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力弱。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，通过创建详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，使用分层思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化输出的人口统计推断）来指导LLM。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估显示，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的挑战，同时提供了透明的推理链，在零样本人口统计推断方面表现出色。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，而检测个体相对于自身历史模式的异常行为在大规模数据集中仍具挑战性。

Method: 学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置意义和时间模式；采用行为聚类感知建模机制，构建个性化行为档案并通过跨周期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 能够检测行为转变和日常习惯的偏差，并在大规模移动数据集中识别表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多需要随机性的应用场景不断涌现，但LLM在处理随机性方面的能力尚不明确，需要系统评估。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、项目洗牌以及使用熵和NIST测试套件评估随机性质量等任务。

Result: LLM生成的输出虽然表现出一定程度的随机性，但性能不一致，且经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要在这些领域进行改进才能有效处理随机性任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Motivation: 解决在复杂、随机环境中，代理只有"一次生命"探索敌对环境且无人指导的现实挑战性场景下的符号世界建模问题。

Method: 使用条件激活的程序化法则，采用前提-效果结构，在相关世界状态中激活，创建动态计算图，仅通过相关法则路由推理和优化。

Result: 在23个测试场景中的16个上优于强基线，能够从最小化、无指导的交互中成功学习关键环境动态，模拟推演成功识别出更优策略。

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法，通过目标达成问题重构、轻量级价值函数训练和梯度干预，实现用户定义的属性强度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，需要更精细的控制机制来适应多样化的用户期望。

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重构为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数预测属性强度；3) 对隐藏表示进行梯度干预以精确导航到目标强度。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实该方法能高精度地将文本生成引导到用户指定的属性强度，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化、对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中实现效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度连续控制，超越了简单的方向性对齐，为AI系统适应多样化用户期望提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: 填补大型语言模型在材料科学推理能力评估方面的空白，建立全面的基准测试来推动该领域的发展。

Method: 构建包含1340个问题的基准测试，采用结构化分类体系，评估不同推理策略（基础思维链、工具增强、自我校正）的表现。

Result: 即使是表现最好的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型在材料科学问题上的准确率也不到80%，表明该基准测试的复杂性。不同推理策略在不同场景下表现不一，没有单一方法在所有情况下都表现优异。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对65项评估可解释AI(XAI)系统的用户研究进行了全面综述，提出了以人为中心的XAI系统设计目标和评估指标，并根据用户AI专业水平（AI新手和数据专家）进行了差异化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求增加。当前XAI系统的评估过程过于技术化，未能充分关注人类用户需求，需要以用户研究为指导来改进评估方法。

Method: 通过对65项XAI用户研究的全面综述，分析XAI系统特性和评估指标，提出以人为中心的设计目标，并根据用户AI专业水平进行差异化设计框架扩展。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释组件构成；评估指标分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；用户特征和行为可被评估；AI新手关注负责任使用、接受度和可用性，数据专家关注性能导向的人机协作和任务表现。

Conclusion: 提出了扩展的XAI评估和设计框架，强调根据用户专业水平差异化的设计目标，为XAI开发者提供了以人为中心的系统设计和评估指南。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建目标导向的API执行任务数据集，通过微调使开源LLM代理在复杂工具使用方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理目标导向查询时能力有限，需要将高级目标分解为多个相互依赖的API调用。闭源模型如GPT-4表现良好，但开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 提出GOAT训练框架，从API文档自动构建合成数据集，在无需人工标注的情况下微调LLM代理，使其具备推理相互依赖调用和生成连贯响应的能力。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Motivation: 现有医学LLM评估方法依赖对话转录后回顾，无法捕捉临床环境中动态、上下文敏感的医患互动复杂性。

Method: 构建知识图谱驱动患者模拟机制，使用控制模块从知识图谱检索医学事实；开发实时轮次评估框架，由法官代理评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实准确性和安全性；建立多轮基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学LLM提供了更可靠的评估方法，支持中英双语并可扩展到其他语言，具有领域特异性适用性。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

Motivation: 解决当前提示工程方法依赖人工设计、缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度编辑能力的问题，同时探索如何有效回收LLM在提示工程过程中的经验。

Method: 设计模块化框架PromptFlow，集成元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验，自动探索最优提示优化路径。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，PromptFlow能够有效提升LLM在特定任务上的性能，且只需少量任务特定训练数据。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了有效的解决方案，通过模块化设计和经验回收机制，显著减少了人工干预需求，提升了LLM的领域适应能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改进LLM主动推理训练，提升策略优化效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中容易出现信念偏差，导致问题状态跟踪失败和重复无效动作，影响强化学习训练效果

Method: 开发T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度偏差并截断训练轨迹，保留信息丰富的前缀部分

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³显著提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，性能提升达30%，同时减少约25%的token使用

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒且可泛化的LLM主动推理器的关键原则

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI缺乏具备所有必要特性的编程语言，PyTorch/TensorFlow缺乏自动推理支持，LISP/Prolog缺乏可扩展性和学习支持，需要统一解决方案。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则和爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，实现神经、符号和统计AI的统一表示。

Result: 能够优雅实现transformer、形式推理、核机器和图模型等关键AI形式，支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和符号推理的可靠性，为AI的广泛采用提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

Conclusion: RAG-Anything为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了当前系统的架构碎片化限制，实现了跨所有模态的全面知识检索。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

*Ayush Khaitan,Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LLM+CAS框架和O-Forge工具，将前沿大语言模型与计算机代数系统结合，通过符号反馈循环生成既具创造性又经过符号验证的证明，特别适用于渐近不等式证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在数学研究中验证困难的问题，回答Terence Tao提出的关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐近不等式的问题，推动AI从竞赛数学向研究级数学工具发展。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，通过符号反馈循环：LLM建议域分解，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证，形成创造性提议与严格验证的结合。

Result: 证明该框架在提出适当域分解方面非常有效，能够处理研究级的渐近分析问题，成功回答了Terence Tao的问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架为专业数学家提供了研究级工具，展示了AI在数学研究中的潜力，超越了传统的竞赛数学应用范围。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文对基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行了首次系统性综述，建立了理论框架和实践分类，揭示了成功实施Vibe Coding的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，编程范式正从代码生成辅助转向自主编程代理，催生了"Vibe Coding"这种通过观察结果而非逐行理解代码来验证AI生成实现的新开发方法。然而这种新兴范式的有效性尚未充分探索，实证证据显示存在意外的生产力损失和人机协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立了Vibe Coding的理论基础（约束马尔可夫决策过程），并综合现有实践提出了五种开发模型：无约束自动化、迭代对话协作、规划驱动、测试驱动和上下文增强模型。

Result: 成功实施Vibe Coding不仅依赖于代理能力，更关键的是系统性的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模型。研究提供了该领域的首个全面分类法。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为一种变革性开发方法，其成功实施需要综合考虑理论框架、实践模型和协作机制，为未来人机协作编程提供了系统性的指导框架。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic是首个评估大语言模型在旅游定价任务中可靠性的基准测试，包含300个基于真实定价政策的问题，测试模型在复杂折扣规则下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将容易出错的价格计算任务自动化给AI系统，但未经验证的LLM部署可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLM的评估显示，在更难的任务层级上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具有通用能力，但在收入关键的应用中，如果没有进一步的安全保障或领域适应，今天的LLM仍然不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MTOS框架，将多主题上下文与LLMs结合，模拟社交网络中的意见演化，解决现有方法在跨领域认知转移和解释性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络中信息常涉及多个相关主题，现有基于LLM的研究多关注单一主题，传统数值模型将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏解释性和行为一致性。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLMs与短期和长期记忆，采用多种用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，并引入信念衰减机制实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争缓解回音室效应。与数值模型相比，LLM代理能更真实地模拟动态意见变化。

Conclusion: MTOS框架通过多主题整合和LLMs应用，提高了社交意见模拟的解释性和系统稳定性，能捕捉复杂的人类推理过程。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习和偏置注意力机制的无信号交叉口自动驾驶决策框架，通过风险评估器将碰撞风险转化为密集奖励信号，指导智能体做出安全高效的驾驶决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将风险转化为密集奖励信号。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法有效提高了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该智能决策框架在复杂场景中具有有效性，证明了集成偏置注意力机制的深度强化学习方法在无信号交叉口决策中的可行性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评判者时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调会显著降低性能，并提出四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM越来越多地被用于自主评估通信系统内容质量，但其评判的公正性无法保证，偏见可能影响结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 在点式评分设置下系统研究两种LLM评判者模型的11种偏见类型，包括隐性和显性偏见，分析模型对偏见输入的响应。

Result: 最先进的LLM评判者对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，通常给偏见样本较低分数；提供详细评分标准能增强鲁棒性；微调会显著降低性能；评分与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM评判者存在偏见风险，但现有模型对偏见输入相对鲁棒，需要采取措施确保实际通信场景中AI评判的公平可靠。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为医疗领域设计一个高效的任务导向对话系统，能够将医疗算法和指南转化为结构化问题，支持自适应访谈流程，并生成符合临床工作流程的结构化报告。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构组织医疗问题，包含五个核心机制：问题转换管道、基于层次聚类的冷启动、扩展剪枝的自适应分支、终止逻辑以及自动化报告生成。

Result: 患者应用NASA-TLX=15.6（低负荷）、SUS=86（高可用性）、QUIS=8.1/9（高满意度）；医生应用NASA-TLX=26（中等负荷）、SUS=88.5（优秀可用性）、QUIS=8.3/9（高满意度）。

Conclusion: 该系统成功降低了认知负荷，支持高效的报告生成，有效整合到临床工作流程中，但存在系统延迟和评估样本有限等局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了细胞状态潜在(CSL)视角，通过操作符语法组织学习过程，强调跨模态、尺度、情境和干预的决策对齐评估框架，以解决当前AI虚拟细胞模型在跨实验室、平台迁移性以及剂量时间效应处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI虚拟细胞模型虽然在单数据集验证中表现良好，但在跨实验室和平台迁移时效果有限，存在数据泄漏和覆盖偏差问题，且剂量、时间和组合效应尚未得到系统处理。跨尺度耦合也受到限制，分子、细胞和组织水平之间的锚点稀疏。

Method: 提出模型无关的细胞状态潜在(CSL)视角，通过操作符语法组织学习：测量、提升/投影用于跨尺度耦合，以及干预用于剂量和调度。强调功能空间读出，如通路活性、空间邻域和临床相关终点。

Result: 提出了决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、情境和干预四个维度。推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏分区以及透明校准和报告，以实现可重复的同类比较。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法框架为AI虚拟细胞提供了更系统的方法论，能够促进跨尺度耦合和决策相关建模，通过标准化评估和透明报告提高模型的可重复性和实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex是一个半可解释的多标签文本分类框架，通过双阶段交替训练策略和无监督原型发现，实现细粒度、语义一致的解释，并在多标签分类任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常只在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）操作，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质，需要更细粒度的可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性，并通过自适应原型和多头注意力捕捉重叠和冲突语义。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上的实验表明，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，同时提供忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex为半可解释多标签文本分类提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够处理细粒度多标签分类任务并提供有意义的解释。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Conclusion: 基于包容性适应度的框架为更战略先进和社会智能的智能体出现提供了基础，可能产生类似生物进化的多智能体自动课程学习。

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注如9x9数独等流行谜题，可能导致模型过度拟合规范格式和记忆解题模式，无法真正测试模型对新规则的理解和策略适应能力。

Method: 设计HardcoreLogic基准，包含10种游戏的5000多个谜题，通过三个维度系统化转换规范谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、不常见元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)。

Result: 评估显示各种LRM模型性能显著下降，即使在其他基准测试中表现优异的模型也严重依赖记忆的刻板模式。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前LRM的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试，表明模型在真正推理能力上存在明显差距。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Conclusion: 将内存管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过统一策略框架实现端到端优化，能够有效提升智能体在长视野任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效提升LLM自动判断任务的性能，通过协作推理和智能停止机制实现准确性和效率的平衡。

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mattia Grasselli,Angelo Porrello,Carlo Augusto Grazia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用车辆间通信数据（CAM）进行车辆轨迹预测，开发了基于图神经网络的CAMNet模型，并在两个数据集上验证了CAM数据在轨迹预测中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，现有传感器存在视野受限和被遮挡的问题。车辆间通信（特别是CAM消息）可以共享信息，提高对遮挡车辆的感知能力。

Method: 设计并训练了基于合作感知消息的图神经网络（CAMNet），在一个广泛使用的运动预测数据集上训练，并在自建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Result: 方法显示出有希望的结果，证明CAM数据确实可以支持车辆轨迹预测，但同时也存在一些局限性。

Conclusion: CAM数据在车辆轨迹预测中具有应用潜力，但需要进一步研究来解决当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶、医疗等安全关键系统中，AI系统需要在各种条件下保持可靠性能，包括处理分布外样本、对抗攻击和环境变化，避免故障带来的严重后果。

Method: 结合自监督学习原理和图论技术，从无标签数据中学习有用表示，从而更有效地识别和分类OOD样本。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到了0.99的优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提高了AI系统的鲁棒性，特别是在OOD检测方面，且无需依赖标记数据，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

TL;DR: CLUTCH是一种基于深度组合多臂老虎机的新颖JavaScript模糊测试方法，通过注意力机制观察变长JavaScript测试用例表示，并使用Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略，显著提高了模糊测试效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JavaScript引擎模糊测试技术使用随机选择来确定在JavaScript代码中的突变位置，这种方法效率不高。作者认为选择更好的突变目标问题适合使用具有可变臂数的组合多臂老虎机来解决。

Method: 提出CLUTCH方法，使用深度组合多臂老虎机，通过注意力机制处理变长JavaScript测试用例表示，并利用Concrete Dropout技术动态适应探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH相比三种最先进的解决方案，平均分别增加了20.3%的有效测试用例数量和8.9%的每测试用例覆盖率。在可变和组合设置中，CLUTCH的遗憾分别减少了至少78.1%和4.1%。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，在可变和组合环境中优于最先进的多臂老虎机方法。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec是一种通过自然语言控制推荐系统的方法，允许用户使用自然语言请求来实时调整推荐内容，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度的控制手段来改变推荐结果。大语言模型（LLMs）提供了解决方案，允许用户通过自然语言请求来指导推荐。

Method: 在训练阶段，使用LLM模拟用户是否会基于语言请求批准项目，并训练嵌入模型来近似这种模拟判断。然后将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统优化的标准信号加权中。部署时，每个用户请求只需要一次LLM嵌入计算，实现实时推荐控制。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求下都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和推荐满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法成功实现了通过自然语言对传统推荐系统进行实时控制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了用户体验。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一个基于多智能体系统的自动定理证明器，能够在Lean中解决跨科学领域的问题，支持自主或与人类专家协作工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学问题需要创造性推理和严格语法严谨性，传统专业系统难以泛化到不同科学领域。

Method: 通过Model Context Protocol为大型语言模型配备Lean工具，结合LLM的知识推理能力和形式化工具确保正确性。

Result: 在公开数学基准测试中与最先进证明器竞争，在新引入的抽象代数和量子理论基准测试中大幅领先，展示了跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于工具的多智能体定理证明方法为跨科学领域的正式验证提供了可泛化的方法论，并成功辅助专家数学家完成复杂密码学定理的形式化证明。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
