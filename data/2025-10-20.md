Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化将原始长视频转换为世界模型训练所需的多模态标注数据，通过AI模型预标注和结构化输出规范，显著提升标注效率并减少人工审核量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练鲁棒的世界模型需要大规模精确标注的多模态数据集，但传统手动标注过程缓慢且昂贵，需要自动化解决方案来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：(1)标准化360度视频格式并分片处理；(2)应用AI模型套件进行密集多模态预标注；(3)整合信号为结构化输出规范供人工快速验证。

Result: 实现效率提升（每审核小时节省约19分钟），人工审核量减少80%以上，通过保守自动跳过低显著性片段，生成高保真、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE工作流提供了可扩展的蓝图，能在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的前提下生成高质量世界模型训练数据，支持跨模态动态学习和动作条件预测。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于解决PET图像低剂量下的泊松噪声问题，提高图像保真度和物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中降低剂量会增加泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net模型，引入新的Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss损失函数，整合物理数据信息。

Result: 在PET数据集测试中，PC-UNet显著提高了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效整合物理信息，为低剂量PET成像提供稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预注意力图来减轻文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，在保持图像质量的同时有效抑制实体间的意外特征传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体间意外传递语义相关特征。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入，需要更高效、轻量的解决方案。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。该方法无需优化，在推理时直接应用。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker仍能有效减轻泄漏而不影响保真度或质量。

Conclusion: 注意力控制在减轻语义泄漏方面具有重要价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，显著提升了城市AI代理的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，无法满足城市AI代理训练的需求。

Method: 开发UrbanVerse系统，包括UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: UrbanVerse构建了来自24个国家的160个高质量场景，在仿真中保持真实世界语义和布局，人类评估的真实感与手工制作场景相当。在城市导航中，训练策略表现出缩放幂律和强泛化能力，仿真成功率提升6.3%，零样本仿真到真实转移提升30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse为城市AI代理提供了可扩展、高保真的训练环境，显著提升了导航性能，在300米真实世界任务中仅需两次干预。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS集成实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge区域感知合并策略，确保编辑区域与未编辑区域的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体编辑方法效率低下、不一致，且难以保持未编辑区域，主要依赖多视角渲染后重建，导致伪影且实用性有限。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge区域感知合并策略，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法，并构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k，包含超过10万个高质量3D编辑对。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性方面的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体帖子构建图像生成模型基准测试，发现了现有基准中缺失的创造性任务，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成基准测试往往滞后于模型发展，无法捕捉新兴使用场景，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中构建基准测试数据集，收集了超过31,000个提示。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创造性复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈指导模型质量度量设计。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实世界使用证据构建基准测试，能更好地反映图像生成模型的实际能力和新兴使用模式。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子模框架的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关和多样化的模型，解决用户在选择和有效使用适配器时面临的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Civit.ai等平台上存在超过10万个LoRA适配器，用户在选择最适合的适配器时面临导航困难、选择困难和缺乏结构化组织的问题。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出了一种新颖的子模框架来解决这个问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域中生成多样化的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的子模框架有效解决了从大规模LoRA适配器数据库中选择相关且多样化模型的问题。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持最先进性能，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的帕累托最优部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型虽然实现了实例级感知的最先进性能，但计算成本高，限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在保持性能的同时实现高效边缘部署的架构。

Method: 提出三种关键技术：(1)瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；(2)语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；(3)简化的统一训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS在仅需三分之一训练迭代的情况下，将像素和变换器解码器FLOPs分别减少55%和75%，同时保持最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高效分割在高性能计算平台和移动设备上建立了新的基准，实现了帕累托最优的模型缩放。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS是一个数据高效框架，通过分解种子问题为基本感知和推理因素，然后系统重组生成大量合成问答对，从而为多模态大语言模型提供高级推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据领域（如图表、渲染文档等）的推理能力限制问题

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因素，然后与新的图像系统重组生成合成问答对，每个问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持因子级过程奖励的强化学习

Result: 在图表推理任务上，COGS显著提高了未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大；使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练能在多个数据集上实现更好的迁移

Conclusion: COGS框架能够诱导出可泛化的能力而非数据集特定的过拟合，并且可扩展到图表以外的其他领域如网页

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个统一物理动力学生成框架，从势能角度将刚体、铰接体和软体动力学整合到几何无关的系统中，通过引入方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，能够从简单运动观察推断物理属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，但需要能够处理复杂物理行为的统一动力学框架。

Method: 采用势能视角，引入方向刚度扩展弹性动力学，使用专门网络建模扩展材料属性，并用神经场以几何无关方式表示变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen提供了一个统一框架来处理多样化的物理动力学，为复杂动态场景中的虚拟环境和机器人训练提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练来解决3D医学影像中数据不足的问题，在多项任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据可用性限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题。

Method: 通过注入额外归纳偏置：引入报告生成目标，并将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练配对，利用图像-文本配对数据集和纯图像数据集，结合3D医学影像领域的最佳实践。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类上达到最先进性能，在语义分割上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过额外的归纳偏置和充分利用可用数据，COLIPRI编码器在3D医学影像的多个任务上表现出色，缓解了数据不足的限制。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间中的推理知识转移来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免了资源密集的监督微调或强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力落后于纯文本模型，现有方法需要大量资源，而简单的模型合并在不同模型家族中效果不稳定。

Method: DRIFT方法预计算推理先验作为参数空间差异，在微调过程中用其偏置梯度，实现推理知识转移而不破坏多模态对齐。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT相比简单合并和监督微调持续提升推理性能，以低成本达到或超越训练密集型方法。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案，能够在保持标准监督微调流程的同时有效提升多模态模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 婴儿日常视觉体验的统计特性（相似图像簇与罕见多变图像交替出现）支持早期类别学习和泛化，这种结构也能提升机器学习中的小数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索婴儿如何从有限经验中实现强大的类别学习和泛化能力，解决婴儿学习能力与经验有限性之间的矛盾。

Method: 分析14名7-11个月婴儿的自我中心视角图像，计算视觉输入的相似性结构，并通过计算实验验证这种结构对机器学习泛化能力的影响。

Result: 婴儿日常视觉输入呈现"块状"相似结构，包含高度相似图像簇和罕见多变图像，这种结构能显著提升机器学习模型在小数据集上的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 婴儿自然体验的块状结构为早期类别学习提供了关键支持，并为各种学习问题提供了高效学习原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出了Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT)框架，通过轨迹与局部文本描述相结合来控制视频生成，解决了多对象场景下传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在复杂场景和多对象设置下控制能力有限，缺乏精确的轨迹与视觉实体对应关系。

Method: 引入位置感知交叉注意力(LACA)整合轨迹和文本信号，采用双重CFG方案分别调制局部和全局文本指导，并开发了数据流水线生成带局部描述的轨迹数据。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐准确性和运动可控性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过轨迹作为直观运动控制手柄，结合局部文本描述，有效提升了视频生成的精确控制和多对象处理能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL是一个通过傅里叶变换在频域中提取全局上下文信息来增强多示例学习框架的方法，用于全切片图像分类，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多示例学习方法在处理全切片图像时难以捕捉全局依赖关系，因为图像尺寸巨大且补丁嵌入具有局部性，这限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力。

Method: 提出FFT-MIL框架，通过快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频分量，使用包含卷积层和Min-Max归一化的FFT-Block处理频域数据，然后将学习的全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合。

Result: 在三个公共数据集（BRACS、LUAD、IMP）上评估了六种最先进的MIL方法，集成FFT-Block后宏观F1分数平均提高3.51%，AUC提高1.51%。

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效且高效机制，能够补充空间特征，提升基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了XModBench基准来评估全模态大语言模型的跨模态一致性，发现现有模型在空间和时间推理、模态差异和方向不平衡方面存在显著问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般跨模态问答能力，但无法确定全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏见。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的XModBench基准，涵盖五个任务族和所有六种模态组合，用于精细诊断模态不变推理、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间和时间推理上准确率低于60%；存在持续模态差异，音频模态性能显著低于文本；存在系统性方向不平衡，视觉作为上下文时一致性较低。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型距离真正的模态不变推理还很远，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但对图像-文本交错文档数据的高质量数据过滤研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成对应文本，创建四个质量级别的样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，用于过滤DataComp描述数据集和OBELICS交错数据集。

Result: 在过滤数据上预训练的MLLMs展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter方法有效提升了多模态预训练数据的质量，并发布了合成训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集供社区使用。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性问题，通过在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估了不同超参数设置和数据增强策略对三个下游数据集的影响，并提出了改进可重复性的实用规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学基础模型训练面临可重复性挑战，主要受软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等因素影响，需要系统研究这些问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、学习率）和数据增强策略，在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon）上进行测试。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值为0.7-0.8时性能最佳，分布式训练无局部损失可提高稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低所有数据集的性能，LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，论文提供了开发可重复数字病理基础模型的实用指导规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以平衡保真度和多样性，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，生成能更好保留类别判别特征并具有额外可控变化的图像。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出色，在常规和长尾设置下分别比最先进的增强方法平均分类准确率提高0.73%和6.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成更好地保留类别判别特征并具有可控变化的图像，有效增强了训练数据集的多样性，从而提高了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Conclusion: CARDIUM数据集和多模态transformer架构为先天性心脏病产前诊断提供了有效的AI解决方案，公开数据和代码将促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了一个统一的高效框架，能够生成高质量、可控的动态3D驾驶场景。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲几何分类框架，将每个标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战性问题，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义。

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体包含、重叠和分离自然建模层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性；提出温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，具有优越的可解释性。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，通过DINO特征构建具有清晰语义可区分性的特征空间，实现更高效的扩散训练和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差的问题，主要原因是VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义可区分性的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提升生成质量，并保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条有原则的路径，解决了传统VAE+扩散范式的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Method: 提出CoMe方法，包括：1）使用激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2）基于拼接的层融合方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3）分层蒸馏协议利用原始模型和剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Conclusion: CoMe通过渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏有效解决了传统结构化剪枝方法的局限性，在显著减少模型大小的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能单数据集训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器（APAE）和渐进式原型感知解码器（PPAD），并引入原型感知损失函数解决多数据集训练中的原型专家选择不稳定问题。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，Proto-Former相比现有最先进方法实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习机制有效解决了多数据集面部关键点检测的统一建模问题，提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏评估6D空间推理的综合框架，需要开发新的评估方法来测试大型多模态模型的复杂3D空间推理能力。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4种关键空间推理能力，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别，并引入了相对性能下降率(RPDR)来量化挑战。

Result: 评估显示随着任务复杂度增加，模型性能普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中表现较差，并发现了不同属性间的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3D空间推理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进，Spatial457数据集为评估和提升这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Motivation: 当前人体运动重建方法在3D空间精确定位方面存在困难，而真实人物与环境交互的动画对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人应用至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代优化关键帧中人体网格与场景点云的匹配，并保持非关键帧与关键帧的相对位置一致性。

Conclusion: SHARE通过利用场景几何线索有效解决了人体在3D空间中的精确定位问题，为各种应用提供了更可靠的人体运动重建方案。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，集成捕获脑电信号在时间、空间和频域的依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集和一个临床MI ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法，并能有效捕获神经生理相关区域。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能够有效捕获脑电信号的多域依赖关系，在运动想象分类任务中表现出色，具有神经生理学意义。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测对高级分析和辅助具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，训练鲁棒的深度学习模型面临挑战。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调方法：1）线性探测阶段在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层；2）渐进冻结阶段动态减少可微调层数，调节对手术领域的适应。该方法降低网络复杂度，提高效率，仅需单次训练循环。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上验证，使用ImageNet预训练的ResNet-50和DenseNet-121架构，检测性能优于现有方法和标准微调技术，mAP达96.4%。在CATARACTS数据集上进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是改善不同手术程序中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效解决多视图3D检测中的深度预测质量问题，无需LiDAR显式监督，在nuScenes数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕捉，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 提出姿态感知融合策略，结合全局和局部配准，将辅助姿态图像迭代融合到主姿态的3DGS表示中，并智能整合3D基础模型进行配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过多姿态融合有效解决了单姿态重建的局限性，实现了更完整和高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线运动风格化框架扩展到在线设置，实现了实时、长序列的任意运动风格化，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过学习任务特定特征而非攻击特定特征，来检测未知的越狱攻击，提高检测准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化能力差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率。

Method: 包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块用于安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块用于无监督攻击分类。

Result: 在多种未知攻击上实现了一致更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效检测未知越狱攻击，具有更好的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety框架使用零样本语义分割从街景图像提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析交通事故数据，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释模型，并应用GPS加权和ATE估计来量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通安全分析中的两个核心挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化这些指标对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割从街景图像提取11个街道指标，结合道路类型分析30,000个事故记录；训练XGBoost多类分类器并用SHAP解释特征贡献；应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度的视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的、数据驱动的工具，支持针对性干预和高风险走廊诊断。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch就能达到最优精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，特别是在医学影像等数据稀缺领域提高学习效率。

Method: PC范式将任务解耦为两个模块：预测先验模块（PPM）利用双侧对称性生成粗略近似，校正残差网络（CRN）学习残差误差并精炼关键区域。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最优精度，且仅需1-5个epoch收敛，远超传统端到端模型。

Conclusion: 通过显式引入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著的学习加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

TL;DR: 提出证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，在长视频推理任务中实现新的SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中静态均匀帧采样导致信息稀释和关键证据模糊的问题，现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充

Method: 证据感知强化学习(EARL)框架，将模型转化为证据的主动询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节

Result: 在五个要求严格的视频推理基准测试中达到开源Video LLMs的新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%

Conclusion: 强调证据纯度优先的重要性以及所提框架的有效性，模型同时学习了有效且高纯度的视觉证据选择策略

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅依赖RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从三个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态依赖，设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升MAV动作识别性能，结合互补数据和跨视角交互机制是关键。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航空跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中来生成精确提示，解决了现有方法仅依赖空间定位监督导致提示模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的夜间航空跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力，性能仍然较差。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中，作为核心指导信号；最后基于通道类别对应关系的核引导提示模块在搜索区域特征中传播核来精确定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示，结合空间门控实现鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核中生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航空跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视了时间增强策略，无法充分利用微表情的运动特性。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段生成独立的动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均有显著提升，结合空间增强可获得最高10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

TL;DR: MRASfM是一个专为驾驶场景设计的运动恢复结构框架，通过利用多摄像头系统的固定空间关系、平面模型去除错误点、将多摄像头作为单一单元进行优化，以及多场景聚合，解决了传统SfM在驾驶场景中的姿态估计不可靠、路面重建异常值多和效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM在应用于多摄像头系统捕获的驾驶场景时存在三个主要问题：相机姿态估计不可靠、路面重建中异常值过多、重建效率低下。这些问题限制了SfM在自动驾驶等应用中的实用性。

Method: 1. 利用多摄像头系统的固定空间关系提高相机姿态估计可靠性；2. 使用平面模型有效去除三角化路面中的错误点；3. 在Bundle Adjustment中将多摄像头系统作为单一单元处理以减少优化变量；4. 通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在真实车辆上部署验证了MRASfM在不同场景下的泛化能力和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。在公开数据集上的大规模验证显示，MRASfM在nuScenes数据集上达到了0.124的绝对姿态误差，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架专门针对驾驶场景的多摄像头系统设计，通过改进姿态估计、路面重建和优化效率，显著提升了SfM在自动驾驶应用中的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量快速增长，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。无人机视频具有俯视视角、结构同质性强、目标组合语义表达多样等特点，现有基于地面视角的跨模态方法难以有效建模这些特性。

Conclusion: 针对无人机场景需要专门的检索机制，MSAM方法通过深度模态交互和鲁棒特征表示，有效解决了无人机视频-文本检索的挑战。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: HiMA框架通过分层混合架构和局部分布调整，有效解决了低光RAW图像增强中的效率和质量问题，为高效ISP提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制任务所需的特定动态视觉信息，利用预训练扩散模型的条件化策略可以有效提升机器人控制的视觉表示质量。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Abstract: We introduce Shakti VLM, a family of vision-language models in the capacity
of 1B and 4B parameters designed to address data efficiency challenges in
multimodal learning. While recent VLMs achieve strong performance through
extensive training data, Shakti models leverage architectural innovations to
attain competitive results with fewer tokens. Key advancements include

extraction, and general multimodal reasoning. Our results highlight that high
performance can be achieved through model design and training strategy rather
than sheer data volume, making Shakti an efficient solution for
enterprise-scale multimodal tasks.

*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)方法，无需属性标签即可识别人脸识别模型中的偏见子群体，通过潜在方向实现语义一致的分组和可解释方向发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏见，传统偏见评估框架依赖标注属性，成本高且限于预定义类别。

Method: LFA使用潜在方向识别子群体，相比标准聚类方法能实现语义一致的分组，并发现与年龄、种族、着装等属性对应的可解释方向。

Result: 在四种最先进识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，同时发现与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者无需预定义属性标注即可识别和解释偏见子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是平衡多任务注意力机制，结合空间和光谱特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需预训练模型的高性能分类方法，验证系统化架构设计在特定领域应用中的有效性。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线模型、CBAM增强模型和平衡多任务注意力模型。使用Coordinate Attention提取空间特征，Squeeze-Excitation块提取光谱特征，通过可学习融合参数统一。采用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习参数自主收敛到alpha≈0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。性能与微调ResNet-50仅差1.34%。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在特定领域应用中有效，无需外部数据即可达到接近预训练模型的性能。平衡多任务注意力机制成功解决了卫星图像分类中的关键挑战。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中具有重要价值，但与常规MRI相比，其可及性较差且成本更高。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组区分诊断准确率从75.0%提升至84.7%，且模拟PET图像获得更高诊断确定性和评估者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，有望在资源有限环境中改善早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下的识别挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的帧，标注转录、语义类别、文本类型和遮挡状态，使用旋转边界框表示以支持空间精确的OCR应用。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下对6个识别模型和7个检测模型进行基准测试，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著性能提升，展示了该数据集在少样本学习场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: ClapperText为在低资源档案环境中推进鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了现实且文化基础丰富的资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以应对姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影，需要更鲁棒的检测方案。

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角检测边界不一致性，中观视角分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角捕捉眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴等表情区域失真；同时加入人脸朝向编码器进行姿态分类。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上实验证明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法，在复杂姿态和光照条件下表现出色。

Conclusion: 多视角融合架构能够有效提升DeepFake检测的鲁棒性，特别是在处理姿态变化和真实世界复杂条件时表现优异。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是有效的模态转换工具，还可作为验证实验准确性和图像保真度的实用诊断工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP方法的准确性，锐化方法使融合图像的光谱和空间准确性分别提高了49.46%和78.40%

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法有效提升了时空图像融合性能，特别是ABSIS锐化方法在光谱和空间准确性方面取得了显著改善

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of

TL;DR: OmniVinci是一个开源的多模态大语言模型，通过创新的模型架构和数据管道，在视觉和音频模态之间实现强对齐，使用仅0.2T训练token就超越了Qwen2.5-Omni在多个基准测试上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进机器智能需要开发像人类一样感知多模态世界的能力，因此需要构建强大的开源多模态LLM。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：OmniAlignNet增强视觉和音频嵌入在多模态潜在空间中的对齐；时间嵌入分组捕捉视觉和音频信号的相对时间对齐；约束旋转时间嵌入编码多模态嵌入中的绝对时间信息。同时引入生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管道。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni（跨模态理解）上比Qwen2.5-Omni高出19.05分，在MMAR（音频）上高出1.7分，在Video-MME（视觉）上高出3.9分，而训练token仅使用0.2T，比Qwen2.5-Omni的1.2T减少了6倍。

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑磁共振成像中标注数据有限、成本高或不一致的问题，提供可扩展的无监督肿瘤分割方案。

Method: 使用仅在健康脑MRI上训练的多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，结合早期-晚期融合策略整合多序列MRI信息，并采用Segment Anything Model进行后处理优化肿瘤轮廓。

Result: 在BraTS-GoAT 2025数据集上，测试集病灶级Dice相似系数分别为：全肿瘤0.437、肿瘤核心0.316、增强肿瘤0.350；验证集异常检测率达89.4%。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医疗统一多模态模型，能够在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医疗AI系统在数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗AI系统破坏了统一诊断流程：图像理解模型无法生成视觉输出，图像生成模型无法提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: 在5个医疗图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医疗成像模态的生成质量上与专用模型相当，双向知识共享使生成任务增强了视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 将传统分离的能力整合到单一医疗框架中，能够在多样化医疗视觉语言任务中实现全面改进，证明了统一架构的价值。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过注入方向性网格运动编码来增强Video Swin Transformer，显著提升了在档案影片和现代视频上的相机运动分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在档案影片（如二战影片）上相机运动分类模型性能下降的问题，这些影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战。

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入方向性网格运动编码，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入光流信息。

Result: 在现代视频上准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏观F1从82.08%提升到87.81%；在二战影片上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏观F1从81.72%提升到82.63%。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验和Transformer表示是互补的，即使是小型精心校准的运动头也能显著增强在退化影片分析中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Motivation: 指令视频编辑技术因缺乏大规模高质量训练数据而发展受限，需要解决数据稀缺这一根本挑战。

Method: 1）融合领先图像编辑器和上下文视频生成器的数据生成管道；2）采用高效蒸馏模型架构和时间增强器降低计算成本；3）智能代理驱动整个流程，确保质量控制和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了指令视频编辑的数据瓶颈问题，通过规模化高质量数据生成实现了技术突破。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: SEGA是一种用于内容感知布局生成的分步进化范式，通过粗到细的分层推理框架和布局设计原则作为先验知识，显著提升了复杂元素布局规划的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏基于反馈的自校正机制，在面对复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加。

Method: 采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，然后精炼模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEGA通过分步进化范式显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能，特别是在复杂布局规划场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于识别和减轻文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在面对隐含性暗示提示时容易生成不当内容，现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，而微调方法会损害生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发噪声检测方法，并提出噪声增强自适应负向引导机制来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证，NDM性能优于现有SOTA方法如SLD、UCE和RECE等。

Conclusion: NDM框架能有效检测和缓解隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型原始生成能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，可以使用粗标注数据（如边界像素未标注）。但粗标注训练的分割模型在类别边界对齐方面表现不佳。

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于超像素的正则化方法，鼓励解码后的分割像素形成SLIC超像素（基于颜色和位置，独立于分割标注）。

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比最先进模型，边界召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了在粗标注数据上训练的分割模型的边界对齐性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频保真度不足和罕见激活尖峰的问题，提升图像质量而不增加显著开销。

Method: 结合每样本微钳制来温和限制极端值，以及自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip）根据区域调整允许的值范围，可基于局部结构统计或注意力熵引导运行。

Result: 在SD/SDXL骨干网络上获得一致的定性改进，与CFG/Rescale有协同作用，能在不产生伪影的情况下使用更高的引导强度。

Conclusion: QSilk是一个高效的无训练稳定解决方案，显著提升了潜在扩散模型的渲染质量，特别是在低步数和高分辨率场景下。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM实现了更高的概念和类别准确性，在可解释性和分类性能上都优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过将概念基于视觉证据，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Conclusion: ReCon框架有效克服了现有生成方法的局限性，为训练鲁棒感知模型提供了高质量的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云序列注册中的两个关键挑战：局部最小值问题和长序列中的误差累积问题，这些因素导致变形估计不准确和跟踪失败。

Method: 采用数据驱动方法，设计两阶段管道：首先生成帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口内随时间细化节点轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上超越现有最优方法，速度提升超过4倍，显著提高效率。

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，利用时序信息实现准确一致的序列注册，在精度和效率方面均有显著优势。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

TL;DR: VISTA是一个多代理系统，通过迭代循环自动改进视频生成质量，通过分解用户想法、选择最佳视频、专业代理批评和推理代理重写提示来实现持续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本到视频生成的方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性。

Method: VISTA采用多代理系统：首先将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，然后由专注于视觉、音频和上下文保真度的三个专业代理进行批评，最后由推理代理综合反馈并重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA相比现有方法能持续提高视频质量和用户意图对齐度，达到60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中更偏好VISTA输出。

Conclusion: VISTA通过自主迭代改进机制，显著提升了文本到视频生成的质量和用户意图对齐度，在多场景视频生成中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

TL;DR: RelateSeg通过神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中引入一阶逻辑约束，提升对多类别图像的分割性能，无需额外参数即可达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉语言模型的方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，导致在开放词汇语义分割中性能受限。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系并编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过伪类别同时预测语义类别和空间关系，使用模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到平均mIoU的SOTA性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，RelateSeg验证了通过空间关系约束可以显著提升分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一种基于图像的重新照明模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像中学习到的生成先验，实现单张肖像图像的高质量重新照明渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于基础模型的假设和近似。需要一种能够利用生成先验来处理单目肖像重新照明这一欠约束问题的方法。

Method: 首先将输入肖像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后使用基于三平面的反射网络合成高质量单光源图像，最后根据HDRI环境图组合生成图像实现物理准确的重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过结合生成头部模型的几何先验和光舞台数据训练的反射网络，3DPR能够从单张肖像图像生成高质量的重新照明结果，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: Memory-SAM是一个无需训练、无需人工提示的舌像分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实场景下显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。需要一种无需训练和人工干预的自动舌像分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过检索到的范例生成前景/背景点提示，自动指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，混合测试集的mIoU达到0.9863，显著优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌像不规则边界分割，在真实世界条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成基于多模态输入的离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在多种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了自回归+扩散混合架构的有效性，同时强调了数据质量与规模、强化学习应用以及后训练对提升图像生成和编辑能力的重要性。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 解决生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中因提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示而缺乏透明度的问题，这些限制影响了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对集合。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，BiomedXPro为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures

Motivation: 现有毒性检测器主要依赖单标签基准，无法充分捕捉真实世界毒性提示的模糊性和多维度特性，导致有偏评估和可靠性问题。

Method: 开发了基于伪标签的毒性检测方法，从公共毒性数据集构建多标签基准，并理论证明伪标签训练优于单标签监督学习。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著超越了包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek在内的先进基线模型，实现了更准确可靠的多标签毒性评估。

Conclusion: 提出的多标签基准和伪标签方法能够更有效地评估LLM生成内容中的多标签毒性，解决了现有毒性检测的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range
of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful
content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors
primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the
inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts.
This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic
detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing
detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across
fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering
effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce
three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL},
\textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets
and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide
a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels
yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision.
In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses
advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate
and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Motivation: 鉴于AI在处理成语方面的潜在局限性，研究旨在评估生成式AI模型在评分含成语和不含成语作文时的表现差异。

Method: 从语料库中选取348篇学生作文，创建两个相等的作文列表（一个含多个成语，一个不含成语），让三种生成式AI模型使用与人类评分者相同的评分标准进行三次评分。

Result: 所有模型都表现出良好的一致性，但Gemini在与人类评分者的互评可靠性方面表现最优。AI评估未检测到对任何人口群体的偏见，对于含多个成语的作文，Gemini的评分模式最接近人类评分者。

Conclusion: 研究中的模型展示了混合方法的潜力，但Gemini由于其处理比喻语言的能力，是处理作文评分任务的最佳候选者，未来有望单独处理此类任务。

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for
numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been
proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays
automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing
idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models
for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus
Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created
from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present
in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models
(ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists
three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay
scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini
outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There
was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For
essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to
human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid
approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to
handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks
alone in the future.

Abstract: Rhetorical strategies are central to persuasive communication, from political
discourse and marketing to legal argumentation. However, analysis of rhetorical
strategies has been limited by reliance on human annotation, which is costly,
inconsistent, difficult to scale. Their associated datasets are often limited
to specific topics and strategies, posing challenges for robust model
development. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and label synthetic debate data based on a
four-part rhetorical typology (causal, empirical, emotional, moral). We
fine-tune transformer-based classifiers on this LLM-labeled dataset and
validate its performance against human-labeled data on this dataset and on
multiple external corpora. Our model achieves high performance and strong
generalization across topical domains. We illustrate two applications with the
fine-tuned model: (1) the improvement in persuasiveness prediction from
incorporating rhetorical strategy labels, and (2) analyzing temporal and
partisan shifts in rhetorical strategies in U.S. Presidential debates
(1960-2020), revealing increased use of affective over cognitive argument in
U.S. Presidential debates.

Motivation: 现代语言模型部署后通常是静态的，持续学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。受参数共享导致遗忘的直觉启发，研究稀疏参数更新是否能够实现无灾难性遗忘的学习。

Method: 引入稀疏记忆微调，利用记忆层模型（Berges等人，2024），这些模型通过设计进行稀疏更新。仅更新被新知识相对于预训练数据使用高度激活的记忆槽。

Result: 在两个问答任务上评估学习和遗忘，与全微调和LoRA参数高效微调相比，稀疏记忆微调在获得相同水平新知识的同时遗忘显著减少：NaturalQuestions F1分数在全微调后下降89%，LoRA下降71%，而稀疏记忆微调仅下降11%。

Conclusion: 结果表明记忆层中的稀疏性为大型语言模型的持续学习提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A
major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is
catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired
capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is
challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we
investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging
memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by
design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new
piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce
interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We
evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and
parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We
find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting
substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after
full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields
only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results
suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual
learning in large language models.

Conclusion: 建议在多语言数据集中控制语法正确性以获得更高且更可解释的结果，神经机器翻译或LLM系统的整句翻译是良好近似方法。

Abstract: For multilingual factual knowledge assessment of LLMs, benchmarks such as
MLAMA use template translations that do not take into account the grammatical
and semantic information of the named entities inserted in the sentence. This
leads to numerous instances of ungrammaticality or wrong wording of the final
prompts, which complicates the interpretation of scores, especially for
languages that have a rich morphological inventory. In this work, we sample 4
Slavic languages from the MLAMA dataset and compare the knowledge retrieval
scores between the initial (templated) MLAMA dataset and its sentence-level
translations made by Google Translate and ChatGPT. We observe a significant
increase in knowledge retrieval scores, and provide a qualitative analysis for
possible reasons behind it. We also make an additional analysis of 5 more
languages from different families and see similar patterns. Therefore, we
encourage the community to control the grammaticality of highly multilingual
datasets for higher and more interpretable results, which is well approximated
by whole sentence translation with neural MT or LLM systems. The dataset and
all related code is published at the Github repository:

*Alexander Brady,Tunazzina Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，能够从无标签语料库中自动生成可解释的主题分类法，应用于Meta政治广告分析，揭示了投票和移民广告占主导地位，以及道德框架与议题之间的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台在塑造政治话语中发挥关键作用，但分析其海量且快速演变的内容仍面临重大挑战，需要可扩展且可解释的分析方法。

Method: 结合无监督聚类和基于提示的标注，利用大语言模型迭代构建分类法，无需种子集或领域专业知识。

Result: 发现投票和移民广告在支出和展示次数上占主导，而堕胎和选举诚信议题获得不成比例的覆盖范围；不同议题的资金模式呈现极化特征；道德框架与议题存在强相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对社交媒体政治信息进行可扩展、可解释的分析，使研究人员、政策制定者和公众能更好地理解新兴叙事、极化动态和数字政治沟通的道德基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse,
but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major
challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an
interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining
unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large
language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring
seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of
Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the
2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse
structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics
with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting
and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion
and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are
equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs,
abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and
crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing
of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression
rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and
liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong
correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also
emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political
messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public
to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral
underpinnings of digital political communication.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了FarsiMCQGen模型的有效性，所生成的数据集具有高质量，有望激发更多关于多选题研究的兴趣。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as
they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However,
generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as
Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an
innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology
combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a
model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage
advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with
rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers.
Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge
questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset
comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has
the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Structure-R1框架，通过强化学习将检索内容转换为结构化表示，优化多步推理过程，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统使用非结构化文本导致信息密度低、推理效果不佳，需要更高效的知识表示方式来提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用强化学习动态生成任务特定的结构化表示，并引入自奖励结构验证机制确保生成结构的正确性和自包含性。

Result: 在7个知识密集型基准测试中，7B规模模型达到竞争性性能，与更大模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 结构化表示通过提高信息密度和上下文清晰度显著增强推理能力，为知识密集型任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by
limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as
context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically
operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information
density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into
structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement
learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that
dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of
multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our
approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific
structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and
reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural
verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both
correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive
benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive
performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much
larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how
structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density
and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Partial YaRN和VLAT两种方法来解决大音频语言模型的长上下文限制问题，Partial YaRN是一种无需训练的音频专用上下文扩展方法，VLAT是训练时的位置增强策略，能显著提升长音频理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大音频语言模型受限于短音频上下文窗口，即使其文本骨干支持长上下文，这限制了长音频理解能力。先前工作主要在单模态LLM上引入上下文扩展方法，但在LALMs上的应用尚未探索。

Method: 1. Partial YaRN：基于RoPE的上下文扩展方法，仅修改音频token位置，保持文本位置不变以保留基础LLM的文本能力；2. VLAT：将Partial YaRN扩展到训练时的位置增强策略，在训练时模拟不同音频长度，实现泛化到远超训练所见长度的输入。

Result: 在SALMONN和Qwen2-Audio上的实验表明，Partial YaRN在多种设置下优于原始模型，VLAT训练策略提供了显著改进，在未见长度的长音频上实现了强大性能。

Conclusion: Partial YaRN和VLAT方法有效解决了LALMs的长上下文限制问题，无需训练即可扩展音频上下文，训练时增强策略进一步提升了长音频理解的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio
context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting
long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension
methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains
unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce
Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only
audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's
text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a
training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional
augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling
generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving
robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and
Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide
range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement,
achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

*Lina Berrayana,Ahmed Heakl,Muhammad Abdullah Sohail,Thomas Hofmann,Salman Khan,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索了离散扩散语言模型（DDLM）与自回归语言模型（ARM）的混合架构，发现将DDLM规划器与ARM执行器结合，特别是在潜在空间通信中，能显著提升准确率并大幅减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型虽然准确率高但需要长序列生成，成本高昂；离散扩散语言模型支持并行生成且在处理复杂推理任务中表现优异，研究旨在探索两者结合是否能获得互补优势。

Method: 首先在文本空间中探索协作，一个模型规划推理过程，另一个基于规划执行最终答案；然后扩展到潜在空间通信，引入学习投影器将DDLM潜在表示映射到ARM的嵌入空间。

Result: 从文本空间转向潜在空间通信带来显著准确率提升：DART-5从27.0%提升到54.0%，AIME24从0.0%提升到14.0%；混合架构在仅使用64个规划token和约5个执行token的情况下，超越了使用44倍更多token的Qwen3.1-7B模型。

Conclusion: DDLM与ARM的混合架构，特别是通过潜在空间通信，为复杂推理任务提供了新的有效方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but
require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language
models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of
steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex
reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid
architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration
can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space,
where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final
answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space
communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the
ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation
limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM
communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy
gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to
14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM
executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact
on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for
planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME,
despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights
into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档理解方法存在局限性：OCR+LLM流水线会丢失结构细节，而原生多模态LLM在上下文建模方面表现不佳。多模态RAG能够实现跨所有模态的整体检索和推理，解锁全面的文档智能。

Method: 提出了基于领域、检索模态和粒度的分类法，回顾了涉及图结构和代理框架的进展，总结了关键数据集、基准和应用。

Conclusion: 多模态RAG是文档AI的重要发展方向，但在效率、细粒度表示和鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战，为未来研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis
to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines
feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face
key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles
with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models
in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text,
tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG.
This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities,
unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this
paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document
understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and
granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic
frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and
highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and
robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

TL;DR: TraceCoder是一个集成多源外部知识的自动化ICD编码框架，通过动态整合UMLS、维基百科和大型语言模型等知识源来增强代码表示、弥合语义差距，并处理罕见和模糊代码，提高编码的可追溯性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化ICD编码方法面临临床文本与ICD代码之间的语义差距、罕见和长尾代码性能差以及可解释性有限等挑战，需要开发能够整合外部知识以提高准确性和可解释性的解决方案。

Method: 提出TraceCoder框架，动态整合UMLS、维基百科和LLMs等多源外部知识，引入混合注意力机制来建模标签、临床上下文和知识之间的交互，改善长尾代码识别并使预测基于外部证据可解释。

Result: 在MIMIC-III-ICD9、MIMIC-IV-ICD9和MIMIC-IV-ICD10数据集上的实验表明，TraceCoder实现了最先进的性能，消融研究验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: TraceCoder为自动化ICD编码提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，符合临床对准确性、可解释性和可靠性的需求。

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns
standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a
critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges
such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on
rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these
issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source
external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding.
TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS,
Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations,
bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a
hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical
context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making
predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments
on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that
TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies
validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable
and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for
accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TACL（阈值自适应课程学习）框架，通过动态调整训练过程来处理医学文本的复杂性差异，在多种临床任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学文本（特别是电子病历）具有非结构化、领域特定语言和上下文变异性等特点，现有方法将所有数据视为同等难度，忽略了临床记录中复杂性的内在差异，限制了模型在罕见或复杂病例上的泛化能力。

Method: TACL框架基于渐进学习原则，根据样本复杂性动态调整训练过程，将数据分类为不同难度级别，在训练早期优先处理简单案例，为处理更复杂记录建立坚实基础。

Result: 在包括英语和中文临床记录的多语言医学数据上应用TACL，在自动ICD编码、再入院预测和中医证候鉴别等多种临床任务中观察到显著改进。

Conclusion: TACL不仅提高了自动化系统的性能，还展示了统一不同医学领域方法的潜力，为更准确、可扩展和全球适用的医学文本理解解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a
cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient
care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for
advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their
unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts
make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements
in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as
equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across
clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively
generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present
TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to
address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts
during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL
dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual
samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler
cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling
more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including
English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements
across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission
prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the
performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify
approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate,
scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

TL;DR: 提出了EGP框架，通过检索相似示例问题及其成功推理路径来指导LLM在知识图谱问答中的规划过程，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的语义鸿沟问题，以及训练无关方法未能充分利用训练数据中宝贵推理模式的问题。

Method: EGP框架：1)通过实体模板化预处理训练集问题；2)使用语义嵌入和FAISS索引检索相似示例；3)在任务分解和关系探索两个阶段动态指导LLM规划；4)引入智能前瞻机制提高效率。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个真实世界KGQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，PoG-EGP显著优于基线PoG系统和其他对比方法。

Conclusion: EGP框架通过示例引导的规划有效提升了LLM在知识图谱问答中的性能，证明了利用训练数据中成功推理模式的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise
in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the
semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph
(KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient
exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable
reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning
capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set
questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then
retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning
paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient
FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning
process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated
sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by
providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning
accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during
relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising
paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the
Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two
real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP
significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Motivation: 研究自动作文评分系统，旨在为书面内容评估提供高效准确的工具，特别关注不同相似度度量方法和n-gram表示的效果。

Method: 使用初中公民教育科目的作文数据，通过预处理提取n-gram特征，使用向量空间模型将文本转换为数值表示，然后分别计算Jaccard系数和余弦相似度，并通过RMSE评估系统性能。

Result: 余弦相似度的表现优于Jaccard系数，一元文法的RMSE低于二元和三元文法。

Conclusion: 在自动作文评分中，余弦相似度比Jaccard系数更有效，且一元文法特征比更高阶的n-gram特征表现更好。

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a vital area of research aiming to provide
efficient and accurate assessment tools for evaluating written content. This
study investigates the effectiveness of two popular similarity metrics, Jaccard
coefficient, and Cosine similarity, within the context of vector space
models(VSM)employing unigram, bigram, and trigram representations. The data
used in this research was obtained from the formative essay of the citizenship
education subject in a junior high school. Each essay undergoes preprocessing
to extract features using n-gram models, followed by vectorization to transform
text data into numerical representations. Then, similarity scores are computed
between essays using both Jaccard coefficient and Cosine similarity. The
performance of the system is evaluated by analyzing the root mean square error
(RMSE), which measures the difference between the scores given by human graders
and those generated by the system. The result shows that the Cosine similarity
outperformed the Jaccard coefficient. In terms of n-gram, unigrams have lower
RMSE compared to bigrams and trigrams.

TL;DR: CoordGen是一个移动推理框架，通过将推测解码与动态硬件调度相结合，加速移动设备上的上下文感知文本生成，实现了最高3.8倍的生成速度提升和4.7倍的能效提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然移动设备上的神经网络处理器已经显著提高了预填充阶段的效率，但逐个令牌的生成过程仍然存在高延迟和硬件利用率有限的问题，这源于其固有的内存限制特性。

Method: 框架包含三个协同组件：自适应执行调度（动态平衡预填充和解码阶段的计算图）、上下文对齐草稿生成（通过轻量级在线校准提高推测效率）和硬件效率草稿扩展（重用和扩展中间序列以提高处理并行性和降低验证成本）。

Result: 在多个智能手机和代表性工作负载上的实验显示，与现有移动推理解决方案相比，生成速度最高提升3.8倍，能效最高提升4.7倍。组件级分析进一步验证了每个优化的贡献。

Conclusion: CoordGen通过集成推测解码与动态硬件调度，有效解决了移动设备上大语言模型生成过程的高延迟和低硬件利用率问题，为智能助手和UI代理等应用提供了高效的上下文感知文本生成能力。

Abstract: Enhancing on-device large language models (LLMs) with contextual information
from local data enables personalized and task-aware generation, powering use
cases such as intelligent assistants and UI agents. While recent developments
in neural processors have substantially improved the efficiency of prefill on
mobile devices, the token-by-token generation process still suffers from high
latency and limited hardware utilization due to its inherently memory-bound
characteristics. This work presents CoordGen, a mobile inference framework that
integrates speculative decoding with dynamic hardware scheduling to accelerate
context-aware text generation on mobile devices. The framework introduces three
synergistic components: (1) adaptive execution scheduling, which dynamically
balances compute graphs between prefill and decoding phases; (2)
context-aligned drafting, which improves speculative efficiency through
lightweight online calibration to current tasks; and (3) hardware-efficient
draft extension, which reuses and expands intermediate sequences to improve
processing parallelism and reduce verification cost. Experiments on multiple
smartphones and representative workloads show consistent improvements of up to
3.8x in generation speed and 4.7x in energy efficiency compared with existing
mobile inference solutions. Component-level analysis further validates the
contribution of each optimization.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在古诗词生成和评估中的表现，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 采用三步评估框架：计算指标、LLM作为评判者评估、人类专家验证，评估了六个最先进的LLM在诗歌质量多个维度的表现。

Result: 发现LLM存在系统性的生成和评估偏差，在评估创意质量时表现出"回音室"效应，其标准与人类判断存在分歧。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为文学生成代理的能力既有潜力也有局限，在文化和技术上复杂的创意任务中，仍然需要人类和模型的混合验证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to creative domains,
yet their performance in classical Chinese poetry generation and evaluation
remains poorly understood. We propose a three-step evaluation framework that
combines computational metrics, LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and human expert
validation. Using this framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across
multiple dimensions of poetic quality, including themes, emotions, imagery,
form, and style. Our analysis reveals systematic generation and evaluation
biases: LLMs exhibit "echo chamber" effects when assessing creative quality,
often converging on flawed standards that diverge from human judgments. These
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current capabilities
of LLMs as proxy for literacy generation and the limited evaluation practices,
thereby demonstrating the continued need of hybrid validation from both humans
and models in culturally and technically complex creative tasks.

Abstract: Building effective knowledge graphs (KGs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) is pivotal for advancing question answering (QA) systems. However, its
effectiveness is hindered by a fundamental disconnect: the knowledge graph (KG)
construction process is decoupled from its downstream application, yielding
suboptimal graph structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce AutoGraph-R1, the
first framework to directly optimize KG construction for task performance using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). AutoGraph-R1 trains an LLM constructor by framing
graph generation as a policy learning problem, where the reward is derived from
the graph's functional utility in a RAG pipeline. We design two novel,
task-aware reward functions, one for graphs as knowledge carriers and another
as knowledge indices. Across multiple QA benchmarks, AutoGraph-R1 consistently
enables graph RAG methods to achieve significant performance gains over using
task-agnostic baseline graphs. Our work shows it is possible to close the loop
between construction and application, shifting the paradigm from building
intrinsically ``good'' graphs to building demonstrably ``useful'' ones.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现传统可读性评估指标与人类感知存在不匹配，基于模型的方法在评估文本可读性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可读性评估领域存在定义不一致的问题，且主要依赖表层文本特征，需要更准确地反映人类对可读性的感知。

Method: 分析了897个人类可读性判断，评估了15个传统可读性指标和6个基于模型的指标在5个英语数据集上的表现。

Result: 4个基于模型的指标在与人判断的相关性排名中始终位列前四，而表现最好的传统指标平均排名仅为8.6。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法是可读性评估更有前景的方向，能够更好地捕捉信息内容和主题对可读性的影响。

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and
accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is
hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely
on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors
shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments,
finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly
shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability
metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced,
model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics
consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human
judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average
rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability
metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more
promising direction.

TL;DR: SAFE是一个选择性集成LLM的框架，通过考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识来选择集成位置，在长文本生成中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM集成方法在短文本生成中有效，但在长文本生成中应用不足，且在每个token都集成会降低性能

Method: 提出SAFE框架，选择性集成LLM，考虑分词不匹配和概率分布共识因素，并引入概率锐化策略

Result: 在MATH500和BBH等基准测试中，SAFE在准确性和效率上都优于现有方法，即使集成少于1%的token也能获得提升

Conclusion: SAFE通过选择性集成和概率锐化策略，有效解决了长文本生成中的LLM集成问题，实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising
approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their
complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token
probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be
effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers,
its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper,
we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a
careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of
ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key
factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models
and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we
propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively
ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability,
we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities
spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single
representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500
and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扫描文档解析中复杂元素交织的挑战，现有监督微调方法泛化能力差，特别是在分布外数据上表现不佳，且高质量训练数据有限

Method: 使用强化学习框架LayoutRL，通过整合归一化编辑距离、段落计数准确性和阅读顺序保持的复合奖励来优化布局理解，并构建Infinity-Doc-400K数据集

Result: 在OmniDocBench、olmOCR-Bench、PubTabNet和FinTabNet等基准测试中，Infinity-Parser在各种文档类型、语言和结构复杂性上均实现最先进性能

Conclusion: LayoutRL框架和Infinity-Parser模型显著提升了文档解析的泛化能力，为可复现研究提供了代码、数据集和模型

Abstract: Document parsing from scanned images into structured formats remains a
significant challenge due to its complexly intertwined elements such as text
paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Existing supervised fine-tuning
methods often struggle to generalize across diverse document types, leading to
poor performance, particularly on out-of-distribution data. This issue is
further exacerbated by the limited availability of high-quality training data
for layout-aware parsing tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce
LayoutRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes layout
understanding through composite rewards integrating normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. To support this
training, we construct the Infinity-Doc-400K dataset, which we use to train
Infinity-Parser, a vision-language model demonstrating robust generalization
across various domains. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including
OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of
document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially
outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose
vision-language models. We will release our code, dataset, and model to
facilitate reproducible research in document parsing.

TL;DR: Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下表现不佳，特别是对帕金森病等语音障碍患者的处理存在严重性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Speech-LLMs评估过于理想化，忽略了真实世界中常见的语音不流畅问题，特别是语音障碍患者的实际需求。

Method: 提出VocalBench-DF评估框架，系统评估22个主流Speech-LLMs在多维度语音不流畅场景下的表现。

Result: Speech-LLMs在语音不流畅场景下性能显著下降，音素级处理和长上下文建模是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要开发新方法提升语音不流畅处理能力，构建真正包容的Speech-LLMs。

Abstract: While Speech Large Language Models (Speech-LLMs) show strong performance in
many applications, their robustness is critically under-tested, especially to
speech disfluency. Existing evaluations often rely on idealized inputs,
overlooking common disfluencies, particularly those associated with conditions
like Parkinson's disease. This work investigates whether current Speech-LLMs
can maintain performance when interacting with users who have speech
impairments. To facilitate this inquiry, we introduce VocalBench-DF, a
framework for the systematic evaluation of disfluency across a
multi-dimensional taxonomy. Our evaluation of 22 mainstream Speech-LLMs reveals
substantial performance degradation, indicating that their real-world readiness
is limited. Further analysis identifies phoneme-level processing and
long-context modeling as primary bottlenecks responsible for these failures.
Strengthening recognition and reasoning capability from components and
pipelines can substantially improve robustness. These findings highlight the
urgent need for new methods to improve disfluency handling and build truly
inclusive Speech-LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统方法不适合游戏广告和推荐，主要因为游戏稀疏性(仅数百款游戏)和游戏不平衡性(用户行为被少数热门游戏主导)。

Method: 引入用户游戏生命周期(UGL)来丰富用户行为，提出两种创新策略提取用户短期和长期兴趣，使用逆概率掩码策略解决游戏不平衡问题。

Result: 离线实验平均AUC提升1.83%，在线实验游戏广告CVR提升21.67%，游戏内物品推荐AUC提升0.5%，ARPU提升0.82%。

Conclusion: UGL表示学习能有效解决游戏稀疏性和不平衡问题，显著提升游戏广告和推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video game production necessitates the development of
effective advertising and recommendation systems for online game platforms.
Recommending and advertising games to users hinges on capturing their interest
in games. However, existing representation learning methods crafted for
handling billions of items in recommendation systems are unsuitable for game
advertising and recommendation. This is primarily due to game sparsity, where
the mere hundreds of games fall short for large-scale user representation
learning, and game imbalance, where user behaviors are overwhelmingly dominated
by a handful of popular games. To address the sparsity issue, we introduce the
User Game Lifecycle (UGL), designed to enrich user behaviors in games.
Additionally, we propose two innovative strategies aimed at manipulating user
behaviors to more effectively extract both short and long-term interests. To
tackle the game imbalance challenge, we present an Inverse Probability Masking
strategy for UGL representation learning. The offline and online experimental
results demonstrate that the UGL representations significantly enhance model by
achieving a 1.83% AUC offline increase on average and a 21.67% CVR online
increase on average for game advertising and a 0.5% AUC offline increase and a
0.82% ARPU online increase for in-game item recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决检索增强生成系统在处理医学图像查询时的局限性，因为通用视觉语言模型生成的描述缺乏临床特异性和事实基础。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏管道创建皮肤病学、眼底和胸部X光领域的合成数据集，使用参数高效的QLoRA方法微调MedGemma模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在分类性能上有显著提升，RAGAS评估显示描述忠实度、相关性和正确性均有显著改善。

Conclusion: 建立了一个专门化医学视觉语言模型的强大流程，验证了该模型作为高质量查询生成器的能力，为增强多模态RAG系统在循证临床决策支持中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based
guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their
effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language
Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This
study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for
generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a
synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains,
and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance
was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification
accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption
faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated
substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation
confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating
the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This
work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates
the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork
for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision
support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注模型在完整信息下的被动推理，这与现实世界信息不完整的情况不符，需要研究模型能否主动获取缺失证据。

Method: 构建GuessBench基准，包含感知导向和知识导向图像，要求模型在不完整信息下从候选池中选择目标图像并迭代优化决策。

Result: 评估了20个优秀MLLM，发现主动推理性能远低于被动设置，细粒度感知和及时决策是关键挑战。消融研究表明感知增强对小模型有益，而思维导向方法对所有模型都有帮助。

Conclusion: 多模态主动推理是重要研究方向，细粒度感知和及时决策能力需要进一步提升，思维导向方法具有普适性优势。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities
across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on
passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete
information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not
enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing
evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs
to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under
incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool
without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose
GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented
images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs
and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive
settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis
identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key
challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller
models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model
sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on
multimodal active reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在摘要质量和可控性方面的问题，探索如何通过提示工程提升大型语言模型的摘要生成能力。

Method: 设计多阶段提示生成框架，包括语义分析、主题建模和噪声控制，使用CNN/Daily Mail数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 提示长度对摘要质量影响显著，过短或过长的提示都会降低质量；数据噪声增加会降低ROUGE-L分数；新闻文本处理效果最佳，学术文章处理效果较差。

Conclusion: 通过控制提示策略和优化文本预处理，可以有效提高大型语言模型生成摘要的准确性和可控性。

Abstract: This study presents a controllable abstract summary generation method for
large language models based on prompt engineering. To address the issues of
summary quality and controllability in traditional methods, we design a
multi-stage prompt generation framework. This framework generates summaries
with varying levels of abstraction by performing semantic analysis, topic
modeling, and noise control on the input text. The experiment uses the
CNN/Daily Mail dataset and provides a detailed analysis of different prompt
lengths, data noise, and text types. The experimental results show that prompt
length has a significant impact on the quality of generated summaries. Both
very short and very long prompt tokens result in a decrease in summary quality.
Data noise also negatively affects the summary generation process. As noise
levels increase, the ROUGE-L score gradually decreases. Furthermore, different
text types have varying effects on the model's ability to generate summaries.
The model performs best when handling news texts, while its performance is
worse when processing academic articles. This research provides new insights
into improving summary generation using large language models, particularly in
how controlling prompt strategies and optimizing text preprocessing can enhance
summary accuracy and controllability.

*Gucongcong Fan,Chaoyue Niu,Chengfei Lyu,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE是一个协作框架，结合云端和本地LLM的优势，在保持移动代理任务准确性的同时减少UI暴露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端LLM需要上传完整UI状态，暴露不必要信息；本地LLM容量有限，任务成功率低。需要平衡隐私保护和任务准确性。

Method: 包含三个组件：基于XML层次结构的布局感知块分区、本地和云端LLM协同规划、以及协同决策（本地LLM排名相关UI块，云端LLM在顶级块内选择元素）。

Result: 实验显示CORE减少UI暴露达55.6%，任务成功率略低于纯云端代理，有效缓解不必要的隐私暴露。

Conclusion: CORE框架成功平衡了隐私保护和任务准确性，为移动代理提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and execute tasks
on smartphone user interfaces (UIs). While cloud-based LLMs achieve high task
accuracy, they require uploading the full UI state at every step, exposing
unnecessary and often irrelevant information. In contrast, local LLMs avoid UI
uploads but suffer from limited capacity, resulting in lower task success
rates. We propose $\textbf{CORE}$, a $\textbf{CO}$llaborative framework that
combines the strengths of cloud and local LLMs to $\textbf{R}$educe UI
$\textbf{E}$xposure, while maintaining task accuracy for mobile agents. CORE
comprises three key components: (1) $\textbf{Layout-aware block partitioning}$,
which groups semantically related UI elements based on the XML screen
hierarchy; (2) $\textbf{Co-planning}$, where local and cloud LLMs
collaboratively identify the current sub-task; and (3)
$\textbf{Co-decision-making}$, where the local LLM ranks relevant UI blocks,
and the cloud LLM selects specific UI elements within the top-ranked block.
CORE further introduces a multi-round accumulation mechanism to mitigate local
misjudgment or limited context. Experiments across diverse mobile apps and
tasks show that CORE reduces UI exposure by up to 55.6% while maintaining task
success rates slightly below cloud-only agents, effectively mitigating
unnecessary privacy exposure to the cloud. The code is available at

TL;DR: DeceptionBench是首个系统评估大语言模型在现实社会场景中欺骗行为的基准，涵盖5个领域的150个场景，分析内在行为模式和外在因素影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的快速发展，出现了新的欺骗行为，可能在高风险部署中带来严重风险。现有研究对现实场景中欺骗行为的特征刻画不足。

Method: 构建包含经济、医疗、教育、社交互动和娱乐5个领域的150个场景，超过1000个样本的基准。分析内在维度（利己主义vs奉承行为）和外在维度（中性条件、奖励激励、强制压力）对欺骗输出的影响，并加入多轮交互模拟现实反馈动态。

Result: 对大语言模型和大推理模型的广泛实验揭示了关键漏洞，特别是在强化动态下欺骗行为被放大，表明当前模型缺乏对操纵性上下文线索的稳健抵抗力。

Conclusion: 当前模型对各种欺骗行为缺乏足够的防护机制，迫切需要开发先进的防护措施来应对不同形式的欺骗行为。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also
introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in
high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception
across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically
evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains,
what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect
them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150
meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare,
Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples,
providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the
intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic
tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the
extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive
outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive
pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to
construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.
Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal
critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement
dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to
manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards
against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available
at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在时间敏感领域（如法律、医疗、金融）中作为知识源的应用日益增多，需要确保LLMs不仅事实准确，而且在时间维度上保持一致性。但目前缺乏评估和增强LLMs时间引用一致性的研究。

Method: 提出了TEMP-ReCon基准来评估开源和闭源LLMs的时间引用一致性，涵盖不同资源丰富度的语言环境（英语、法语、罗马尼亚语）。同时开发了UnTRaP模型，基于推理路径对齐来增强LLMs的时间引用一致性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实表现出不足的时间引用一致性。实证实验证明UnTRaP模型相比多个基线模型具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: LLMs在时间引用一致性方面存在不足，需要专门的评估和增强方法。提出的TEMP-ReCon基准和UnTRaP模型为解决这一问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing acceptance of large language models (LLMs) as an alternative
to knowledge sources marks a significant paradigm shift across various domains,
including time-sensitive fields such as law, healthcare, and finance. To
fulfill this expanded role, LLMs must not only be factually accurate but also
demonstrate consistency across temporal dimensions, necessitating robust
temporal reasoning capabilities. Despite this critical requirement, efforts to
ensure temporal consistency in LLMs remain scarce including noticeable absence
of endeavors aimed at evaluating or augmenting LLMs across temporal references
in time-sensitive inquiries. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by
introducing a novel benchmark entitled temporal referential consistency,
accompanied by a resource TEMP-ReCon designed to benchmark a wide range of both
open-source and closed-source LLMs with various linguistic contexts
characterized by differing resource richness (including English, French, and
Romanian). The findings emphasis that LLMs do exhibit insufficient temporal
referent consistency. To address this, we propose \newmodel, a reasoning path
alignment-based model that aims to enhance the temporal referential consistency
of LLMs. Our empirical experiments substantiate the efficacy of UnTRaP compared
to several baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BPE分词在表示罕见词时的低效性和需要大嵌入矩阵的问题，同时避免字符级模型的性能瓶颈和现有分层模型的局限性。

Method: 通过向BPE标记添加显式的补丁结束标记，并引入第二级BPE压缩阶段来控制补丁粒度。

Result: 实证结果表明该方法匹配或优于基于动态熵和空白的补丁策略性能，同时保持紧凑的词汇表。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需依赖额外模型的字符分组解决方案，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used in
large language models due to their balance of vocabulary compactness and
representational power. However, they suffer from inefficiencies in
representing rare words and require large embedding matrices. Character-level
models address these issues but introduce performance bottlenecks, particularly
in Transformer-based architectures. Recent hierarchical models attempt to merge
the benefits of both paradigms by grouping characters into patches, but
existing patching strategies either rely on whitespace-limiting applicability
to certain languages, or require auxiliary models that introduce new
dependencies. In this paper, we propose a dynamic character grouping method
that leverages the structure of existing BPE tokenization without requiring
additional models. By appending explicit end-of-patch markers to BPE tokens and
introducing a second-level BPE compression stage to control patch granularity,
our method offers efficient, flexible, and language-agnostic representations.
Empirical results demonstrate that our approach matches or exceeds the
performance of dynamic entropy- and whitespace-based patching strategies, while
maintaining a compact vocabulary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent-SFT提出了一种两阶段学习框架，通过将潜在推理限制在LLM词汇表的列空间中，实现了与显式推理相当的性能，同时将推理链长度减少最多4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式推理（如思维链）虽然效果好但计算开销大，而现有的潜在推理方法性能显著下降。研究发现性能下降源于非结构化的潜在空间难以拟合潜在标记。

Method: 提出Latent-SFT两阶段框架：第一阶段设计专门的注意力掩码指导潜在标记编码器生成潜在标记；第二阶段丢弃编码器，直接训练LLM自主生成潜在标记进行推理，使用KL和CE损失优化。

Result: 在GSM8k上达到新SOTA，匹配显式SFT性能同时推理链减少最多4倍；在Math500和AIME24上，基于词汇概率的潜在推理明显优于基于隐藏状态的方法。

Conclusion: 潜在推理既是单一路径的压缩，也是多路径的叠加，有效压缩率和有效全局并行度指标验证了这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities with
chain-of-thought prompting, but explicit reasoning introduces substantial
computational overhead. Recent work on latent reasoning reduces this cost by
reasoning in latent space without explicit supervision, but performance drops
significantly. Our preliminary experiments suggest that this degradation stems
from the unstructured latent space, which makes fitting latent tokens
difficult. To address this, we restrict the latent space to the column space of
the LLM vocabulary, treating latent reasoning as a superposition over
vocabulary probabilities. Once latent reasoning concludes, it collapses into an
eigenstate of explicit reasoning to yield the final answer. Based on this idea,
we propose Latent-SFT, a two-stage learning framework. In the first stage, we
design two specialized attention masks to guide the Latent Token Encoder in
generating latent tokens, allowing the LLM to produce the correct answer
conditioned on them. In the second stage, the Latent Token Encoder is
discarded, and the LLM is directly trained to generate these latent tokens
autonomously for latent reasoning, optimized with KL and CE losses. Latent-SFT
sets a new state of the art on GSM8k, matching explicit SFT performance while
cutting reasoning chains by up to 4 times and outperforming prior latent
methods. On Math500 and AIME24, lexical probability-based latent reasoning also
clearly surpasses hidden-state-based approaches. Our metrics of effective
compression rate and effective global parallelism further show that latent
reasoning is both the compression of a single path and the superposition of
multiple paths.

Motivation: 尽管统一编码器在多模态检索中具有灵活性，但在传统对比学习训练下容易学习模态捷径，导致在分布偏移下鲁棒性较差。

Method: 使用偏好损失强制多模态嵌入优于单模态对应物，并通过组合正则化目标将多模态嵌入与其单模态部分组成的原型对齐，显式建模组合表示与单模态对应物之间的结构关系。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，该方法在分布外检索方面取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 模态组合感知是使用MLLMs作为统一编码器时实现鲁棒组合多模态检索的有效原则。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across
modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to
contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like
CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly
processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that
unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to
learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts.
We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue.
Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform
their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective
aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts.
These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed
representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks
show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition
awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval
when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

*Sibo Xiao,Jinyuan Fu,Zhongle Xie,Lidan Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokenTiming算法，通过动态时间规整技术实现通用推测解码，解决传统推测解码中草稿模型和目标模型必须共享词汇表的限制，实现1.57倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法要求草稿模型和目标模型共享词汇表，这限制了可用草稿模型的选择范围，往往需要从头训练新模型。

Method: 基于动态时间规整算法，通过重新编码草稿令牌序列获得新的目标令牌序列，然后使用DTW建立映射来传输概率分布以进行推测采样。

Result: 在各种任务上的综合实验显示实现了1.57倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该方法支持不匹配的词汇表，可与任何现成模型配合使用而无需重新训练和修改，为草稿模型选择提供了通用方法，使推测解码成为更通用实用的LLM加速工具。

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a
critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially
improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a
fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same
vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often
necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose
the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by
re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and
then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for
speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched
vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and
modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks,
demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft
model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM
acceleration.

*Vihari Piratla,Purvam Jain,Darshan Singh,Partha Talukdar,Trevor Cohn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出跨语言差距的主要原因是目标语言响应的方差，而非潜在表示差异，并通过方差控制方法显著提升了目标语言准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将跨语言差距归因于源语言和目标语言潜在表示的差异，但本文认为目标语言响应的方差才是主要原因。

Method: 通过偏差-方差分解形式化跨语言差距，采用推理时干预方法来控制方差，包括简单的提示指令。

Result: 通过降低响应方差，目标语言准确率在不同模型上提升了20-25%。

Conclusion: 目标语言响应的方差是跨语言差距的关键因素，通过方差控制可以显著改善跨语言知识获取性能。

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural
languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act
as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it
accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a
cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a
target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing
research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and
target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an
alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target
language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the
cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive
experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We
then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions
that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a
simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved
target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

*Jinliang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ParallaxRAG框架，通过对称解耦查询和图三元组到多视图空间，构建鲁棒的检索架构，显式增强头部多样性并约束弱相关路径，以改善多跳推理中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言理解方面表现出色，但经常产生幻觉并在多跳推理中挣扎。基于知识图谱的检索增强生成提供基础，但大多数方法依赖扁平嵌入和噪声路径探索。

Method: ParallaxRAG框架将查询和图三元组对称解耦到多视图空间，利用不同注意力头在不同推理阶段专门处理语义关系的特点，构建更清晰的子图并指导LLMs进行逐步推理。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ数据集上的实验表明，该框架在检索和问答性能上具有竞争力，同时减少了幻觉并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视图头部专业化是知识基础多跳推理的一个有原则方向，为改善LLMs的推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often
hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely
on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a
framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into
multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly
enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our
approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in
semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops
of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct
cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning.
Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 +
Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside
reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view
head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop
reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is
accepted.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主要关注英语模型，忽视了韩语等语言的语言文化特性，缺乏专门的韩语指令跟随评估基准

Method: 开发KITE基准，包含通用和韩语特定指令，结合自动化指标和人工评估的评估流程

Result: 揭示了不同模型间的性能差异，深入分析了模型的优缺点

Conclusion: KITE数据集和代码的公开将促进文化和语言包容性LLM开发，激励其他代表性不足语言的类似研究

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex
reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English
models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages.
Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features,
honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for
assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific
instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual
knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended
instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics
with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and
providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly
releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar
endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate world of Urdu poetry, exploring its
thematic depths through a lens of polysemy. By focusing on the nuanced
differences between three seemingly synonymous words (pyaar, muhabbat, and
ishq) we expose a spectrum of emotions and experiences unique to the Urdu
language. This study employs a polysemic case study approach, meticulously
examining how these words are interwoven within the rich tapestry of Urdu
poetry. By analyzing their usage and context, we uncover a hidden layer of
meaning, revealing subtle distinctions which lack direct equivalents in English
literature. Furthermore, we embark on a comparative analysis, generating word
embeddings for both Urdu and English terms related to love. This enables us to
quantify and visualize the semantic space occupied by these words, providing
valuable insights into the cultural and linguistic nuances of expressing love.
Through this multifaceted approach, our study sheds light on the captivating
complexities of Urdu poetry, offering a deeper understanding and appreciation
for its unique portrayal of love and its myriad expressions

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)方法用于文档对齐，相比最优传输方法在保持相似准确度的同时实现了约100倍的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档对齐方法如最优传输(OT)在处理大规模网络挖掘数据时效率较低，需要在准确性和速度之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用跨语言双向最大相似度评分(BiMax)计算文档间相似度，替代传统的最优传输方法。

Result: 在WMT16双语文档对齐任务中，BiMax达到与OT相当的准确度，但速度提高了约100倍。

Conclusion: BiMax方法在文档对齐任务中实现了效率与准确性的良好平衡，相关工具EmbDA已开源。

Abstract: Document alignment is necessary for the hierarchical mining (Ba\~n\'on et
al., 2020; Morishita et al., 2022), which aligns documents across source and
target languages within the same web domain. Several high precision sentence
embedding-based methods have been developed, such as TK-PERT (Thompson and
Koehn, 2020) and Optimal Transport (OT) (Clark et al., 2019; El-Kishky and
Guzm\'an, 2020). However, given the massive scale of web mining data, both
accuracy and speed must be considered. In this paper, we propose a
cross-lingual Bidirectional Maxsim score (BiMax) for computing doc-to-doc
similarity, to improve efficiency compared to the OT method. Consequently, on
the WMT16 bilingual document alignment task, BiMax attains accuracy comparable
to OT with an approximate 100-fold speed increase. Meanwhile, we also conduct a
comprehensive analysis to investigate the performance of current
state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding models. All the alignment
methods in this paper are publicly available as a tool called EmbDA
(https://github.com/EternalEdenn/EmbDA).

Motivation: 虽然共指消解研究日益受到关注，但完全标注的长文档代表性数据集仍然稀缺，特别是针对复杂文学作品的标注语料。

Method: 构建了包含三部完整法语小说的标注语料库（超过28.5万词），并开发了模块化的共指消解流程，支持细粒度错误分析。

Result: 该方法在长文档共指消解中表现竞争力强，能够有效扩展到长文档，并能推断虚构人物的性别信息。

Conclusion: 该语料库和流程对于文学分析和下游NLP任务都具有重要意义，填补了长文档共指消解数据集的空白。

Abstract: While coreference resolution is attracting more interest than ever from
computational literature researchers, representative datasets of fully
annotated long documents remain surprisingly scarce. In this paper, we
introduce a new annotated corpus of three full-length French novels, totaling
over 285,000 tokens. Unlike previous datasets focused on shorter texts, our
corpus addresses the challenges posed by long, complex literary works, enabling
evaluation of coreference models in the context of long reference chains. We
present a modular coreference resolution pipeline that allows for fine-grained
error analysis. We show that our approach is competitive and scales effectively
to long documents. Finally, we demonstrate its usefulness to infer the gender
of fictional characters, showcasing its relevance for both literary analysis
and downstream NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HypoSpace是一个诊断套件，用于评估语言模型提出多种解释的能力，而不仅仅是单一正确答案。它通过有效性、独特性和覆盖率三个指标来衡量模型在不确定科学问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在科学工作流中的广泛应用，需要评估它们提出多种解释（而非单一正确答案）的能力，因为许多科学问题是不确定的：多个机制不同的假设可能与相同观察结果一致。

Method: HypoSpace将LLMs视为有限假设集的采样器，测量三个互补指标：有效性（与观察一致的提案精度）、独特性（提案间的非冗余性）和覆盖率（对枚举可接受集的覆盖）。在三个结构化领域实例化：因果图、重力约束3D体素重建和布尔基因相互作用。

Result: 在指令调优和推理聚焦模型中，有效性通常保持较高，但随着可接受空间的增长，独特性和覆盖率会下降，揭示了仅靠正确性指标无法发现的模式崩溃现象。

Conclusion: HypoSpace提供了一个受控探针，用于明确探索和覆盖可接受解释空间的方法，而不是作为排行榜使用。

Abstract: As language models are increasingly used in scientific workflows, evaluating
their ability to propose sets of explanations-not just a single correct
answer-becomes critical. Many scientific problems are underdetermined:
multiple, mechanistically distinct hypotheses are consistent with the same
observations. We introduce HypoSpace, a diagnostic suite that treats LLMs as
samplers of finite hypothesis sets and measures three complementary indicators:
Validity (precision of proposals consistent with observations), Uniqueness
(non-redundancy among proposals), and Recovery (coverage of the enumerated
admissible set). We instantiate HypoSpace in three structured domains with
deterministic validators and exactly enumerated hypothesis spaces: (i) causal
graphs from perturbations, (ii) gravity-constrained 3D voxel reconstruction
from top-down projections, and (iii) Boolean genetic interactions. Across
instruction-tuned and reasoning-focused models, Validity often remains high
while Uniqueness and Recovery degrade as the admissible space grows, revealing
mode collapse that is invisible to correctness-only metrics. HypoSpace offers a
controlled probe-rather than a leaderboard-for methods that explicitly explore
and cover admissible explanation spaces. Code is available at:

Motivation: 利用LLMs生成背景上下文来增强仇恨言论检测，特别是针对隐含仇恨言论和模因等复杂场景。

Method: 提出两种上下文生成策略（命名实体聚焦和全文提示），比较四种上下文整合方法（文本拼接、嵌入拼接、分层transformer融合、LLM驱动文本增强）。

Result: 在文本Latent Hatred数据集和多模态MAMI数据集上，相比零上下文基线，最佳系统分别获得3和6个F1分数的提升，嵌入拼接方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息和整合方法对仇恨言论检测至关重要，LLMs生成的背景上下文能显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach to textual and multimodal Hate
Speech Detection (HSD), using Large Language Models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge
bases to generate background context and incorporate it into the input of HSD
classifiers. Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on
named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of
incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text
concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based
fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the
textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a
multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest
that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated
are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups
respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system,
based on embedding concatenation.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持甚至提升模型效果的同时，显著降低了计算成本，实现了效率与效果的平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning models have gained significant attention due to their strong
performance, particularly when enhanced with retrieval augmentation. However,
these models often incur high computational costs, as both retrieval and
reasoning tokens contribute substantially to the overall resource usage. In
this work, we make the following contributions: (1) we propose a
retrieval-augmented reasoning model that dynamically adjusts the length of the
retrieved document list based on the query and retrieval results; (2) we
develop a cost-aware advantage function for training of efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning models through reinforcement learning; and (3) we
explore both memory- and latency-bound implementations of the proposed
cost-aware framework for both proximal and group relative policy optimization
algorithms. We evaluate our approach on seven public question answering
datasets and demonstrate significant efficiency gains, without compromising
effectiveness. In fact, we observed that the model latency decreases by ~16-20%
across datasets, while its effectiveness increases by ~5% on average, in terms
of exact match.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DLMs在效率和性能上已得到广泛研究，但其内部工作机制仍不清楚。本文旨在探索DLMs的注意力模式，特别是注意力下沉现象。

Method: 通过实证分析DLMs的注意力模式，重点关注注意力下沉现象，并与自回归模型进行对比研究。

Result: 发现DLMs存在动态变化的注意力下沉，且对注意力下沉的移除具有鲁棒性，性能仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散语言模型在注意力分配和利用方面与自回归模型存在根本性差异，为理解DLMs内部机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ
transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token
generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency
and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that
govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical
analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking
phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based
architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but
with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in
DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic
behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention
sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in
performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of
diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how
they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Motivation: 传统评估方法依赖固定格式任务和参考答案，难以捕捉现代LLM的细微、主观和开放式行为，需要更有效的评估方式。

Method: 提出自动互评框架，LLM通过自玩和同行评审相互评估，使用博弈论投票算法聚合同行评审结果，并与人类投票行为进行系统性对比。

Conclusion: 这是首个将互评、博弈论聚合和基于人类的验证相结合来评估LLM能力的工作，为LLM评估提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether
principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of
large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing
inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on
fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced,
subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where
LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer
assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to
evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates
game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a
principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human
preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between
theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into
the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation,
game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the
capabilities of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何在没有参考翻译的情况下验证AI翻译器（如鲸语翻译器）的问题，避免与动物交互的需求，提高安全性、伦理性和成本效益。

Method: 使用逐段翻译结合经典NLP shuffle测试，通过比较有序翻译与随机排列翻译的合理性来评估翻译质量。

Result: 在数据稀缺的人类语言和构造语言上的概念验证实验表明，该方法与基于参考翻译的标准评估高度相关。

Conclusion: 交互在翻译学习的早期阶段可能不是必要且低效的，提出的无参考评估方法在数据稀缺情况下具有潜在实用性。

Abstract: If you had an AI Whale-to-English translator, how could you validate whether
or not it is working? Does one need to interact with the animals or rely on
grounded observations such as temperature? We provide theoretical and
proof-of-concept experimental evidence suggesting that interaction and even
observations may not be necessary for sufficiently complex languages. One may
be able to evaluate translators solely by their English outputs, offering
potential advantages in terms of safety, ethics, and cost. This is an instance
of machine translation quality evaluation (MTQE) without any reference
translations available. A key challenge is identifying ``hallucinations,''
false translations which may appear fluent and plausible. We propose using
segment-by-segment translation together with the classic NLP shuffle test to
evaluate translators. The idea is to translate animal communication, turn by
turn, and evaluate how often the resulting translations make more sense in
order than permuted. Proof-of-concept experiments on data-scarce human
languages and constructed languages demonstrate the potential utility of this
evaluation methodology. These human-language experiments serve solely to
validate our reference-free metric under data scarcity. It is found to
correlate highly with a standard evaluation based on reference translations,
which are available in our experiments. We also perform a theoretical analysis
suggesting that interaction may not be necessary nor efficient in the early
stages of learning to translate.

their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer
toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one
concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which
truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements
co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model
to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We
corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models.
Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks
first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a
longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn
lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a
mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear
truth representations can emerge in language models.

TL;DR: Paper2Web是一个用于评估学术网页生成的基准数据集和多维评估框架，同时提出了PWAgent，一个将科学论文转换为交互式多媒体学术主页的自主流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学术项目网站在有效传播研究方面存在不足，现有的LLM生成、模板或HTML转换方法难以产生具有布局感知和交互性的网站，且缺乏全面的评估套件。

Method: 提出了Paper2Web基准数据集，包含基于规则的指标和人类验证的LLM评估；开发了PWAgent自主流程，通过MCP工具迭代优化内容和布局。

Result: 实验表明PWAgent显著优于基于模板的网页和arXiv/alphaXiv版本等端到端基线方法，在保持低成本的同时实现了学术网页生成的帕累托最优。

Conclusion: Paper2Web为学术网页生成提供了全面的评估框架，PWAgent能够高效地将科学论文转换为高质量的交互式学术主页。

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
generation.

Motivation: 解决非正式和领域特定语言中情感极性强度检测的挑战，需要更精确和细粒度的情感分析方法。

Method: 使用VADER进行初始情感估计，通过DistilBERT的置信度分数进行两阶段调整，应用模糊逻辑减少中性偏差，最后通过模糊推理系统生成0-1连续情感分数。

Conclusion: 将符号推理与神经模型结合，可在语言动态领域中实现可解释的细粒度情感分析。

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and
social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific
language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer
framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and
fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity
and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment
estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This
involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight
transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive
neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then
maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like
judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific
datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show
improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment
extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics
(distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case
studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This
work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically
dynamic domains.

Motivation: 传统的槽位填充采用语音识别和自然语言理解的级联方法，而语音大语言模型提供了更统一、生成式的解决方案，具有零样本能力和泛化到未见槽位标签的潜力。

Method: 创建任务的经验上界，识别性能、鲁棒性和泛化差距，改进训练数据、模型架构和训练策略来缩小与上界的差距。

Result: 每项改进措施都显著提升了性能，同时揭示了实际挑战。

Conclusion: 为利用这些新兴模型提供了实证指导和见解，展示了在槽位填充任务上的实质性改进。

Abstract: Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU),
traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or
more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of
speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and
textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech
understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following
manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities,
generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by
creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance,
robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training
data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper
bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance
substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical
guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ORBIT框架通过基于量规的增量强化学习，在开放式医疗对话任务中显著提升LLM性能，在HealthBench-Hard基准上从7.0提升至27.2，仅需2k样本即可实现最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在数学和代码等有明确奖励函数的领域表现良好，但在开放式领域如医疗咨询中，由于奖励模糊、主观且依赖上下文，缺乏稳健的奖励函数，限制了RL策略的应用。

Method: 提出ORBIT框架，结合合成对话生成与动态量规创建，使用量规指导增量强化学习过程，不依赖外部医学知识或手动规则，而是通过量规引导的反馈来塑造学习。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Instruct模型上实施ORBIT，仅使用2k样本就将HealthBench-Hard基准性能从7.0大幅提升至27.2，达到该规模模型的最先进水平，并在多样化咨询场景中实现一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 量规驱动的强化学习为在复杂开放式任务中推进LLM提供了一种可扩展策略，超越了简单的数值改进，展示了在医疗对话等高风险领域的重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through
reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be
programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models
benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based
objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in
open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or
context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably
medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas
challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT,
an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed
for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue
generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to
direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend
on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided
feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model,
our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard
benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving
state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that
rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse
consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These
findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing
LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolySkill框架通过将技能的抽象目标与具体实现解耦，使智能体能够学习可泛化和组合的技能，在网站导航任务中显著提升技能重用率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法学习的技能通常过度专门化于单一网站，缺乏泛化能力。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够学习通用且可组合技能的新框架。

Method: 受软件工程中多态性的启发，PolySkill将技能的抽象目标（要完成什么）与具体实现（如何执行）解耦，使智能体能够识别和优化自身目标。

Result: 实验表明：1）在已见网站上技能重用率提高1.7倍；2）在Mind2Web和未见网站上成功率分别提升9.4%和13.9%，步骤减少超过20%；3）在自探索设置中提高了任务质量并学习到跨网站通用的技能。

Conclusion: 将技能目标与执行分离是开发能够在开放网络中持续学习和泛化的自主智能体的关键步骤，为构建适应环境持续学习的智能体提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now
powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external
environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating
web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning
often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to
generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to
learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by
polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal
(what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed).
Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen
websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on
unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration
settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of
proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work
across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own
goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum,
leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline
methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of
continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating
a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing
autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web
continuously.

Conclusion: 多级预测系统使运营商能够精确诊断不透明的错误，提高了电网负荷预测的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征来减少冗余同时保留解释力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关预测因子组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力，生成的特征子集可直接用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用，成功预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures相比传统选择技术提供了更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现有效。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的C51分布强化学习算法(ES-C51)，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，通过softmax结合所有可能动作的信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于价值的RL算法只估计每个动作的期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励概率分布。C51是离散动作空间的流行DRL算法，但使用贪婪Bellman更新可能导致当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定问题。

Method: 提出ES-C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代C51的贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为对比基准(QL-C51)。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏上的评估表明，ES-C51在多个环境中优于QL-C51，能够学习到更高性能的策略。

Conclusion: 使用Expected Sarsa更新的ES-C51算法比基于Q学习的C51变体表现更好，特别是在动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布的情况下，能够减少不稳定性并提高性能。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外环境中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，传统RL训练效果有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自博弈监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于模拟未来状态进行策略优化

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，如Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升到59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升到70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力，SPA框架有效提升了RL训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

*Samuel Paech,Allen Roush,Judah Goldfeder,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化管道和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少slop现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（称为slop），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器使用回溯抑制不需要的字符串；自动化管道分析模型特定的slop模式并生成训练数据；FTPO微调方法在单个token级别调整logits。

Result: 成功抑制8000+个slop模式，而传统token禁止方法在2000个模式时就失效；FTPO实现90%的slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效减少LLM输出中的重复模式，显著提升文本质量，且不会像DPO那样导致写作质量和词汇多样性的下降。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种基于物理信息数据驱动预测模型和统计方法的两光子光刻(TPL)系统健康监测方法，能够准确及时地监控机器健康状况，实现基于状态的维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TPL系统的维护实践主要依赖经验而非机器健康监测，导致维护时机不当——要么维护不及时造成机器停机和制造质量差，要么不必要的维护导致效率低下和可避免的停机时间。

Method: 通过集成物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化水平复杂场景的方法。收集了包含6种工艺参数组合和6种结构尺寸在两种机器健康状态下的综合实验数据集进行评估。

Result: 在所有测试场景中，所提出的方法都实现了高精度，表现出优异的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些结果代表了向TPL系统基于状态维护迈出的重要一步，能够显著提升系统维护效率和制造质量。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

### [153] [Online Correlation Clustering: Simultaneously Optimizing All $\ell_p$-norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15076)
*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文首次在在线设置中实现了相关性聚类的多目标同时近似，提出了一个在AOS模型中同时优化所有ℓp范数的算法，填补了离线与在线设置之间的理论鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相关性聚类中的ℓp范数目标在最小化总分歧(ℓ1范数)和确保个体节点公平性(ℓ∞范数)之间存在基本权衡。离线设置中可以实现所有ℓp范数的同时近似，但能否在在线设置中实现这一强大保证是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出了一个在在线带样本(AOS)模型中的单一算法，给定输入的一小部分作为样本，生成一个聚类，该聚类能够同时以高概率在O(log⁴n)竞争比下近似所有ℓp范数，以高概率在O(logn)竞争比下近似ℓ∞范数，以及以期望O(1)竞争比近似ℓ1范数。

Result: 算法成功将离线的"全范数"保证迁移到在线世界。同时证明了在标准随机顺序(RO)在线模型中，ℓ1范数可轻易获得O(1)近似，但任何用于公平促进的ℓ∞范数的算法必须具有至少Ω(n¹/³)的竞争比，这凸显了超越最坏情况模型的必要性。

Conclusion: 该工作首次在在线设置中实现了相关性聚类的多目标同时近似，填补了理论空白，并通过下界分析证明了所提出竞争比在AOS模型中的近似紧致性。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

TL;DR: TempO是一种基于流匹配的潜在模型，通过稀疏条件和通道折叠处理3D时空场，使用时间条件傅里叶层捕获多尺度模式，在PDE动力学预测中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测高维PDE控制动力学是生成建模的核心挑战，现有自回归和扩散方法存在累积误差和离散化伪影问题，限制了长期物理一致性预测。

Method: 提出TempO模型，利用稀疏条件与通道折叠高效处理3D时空场，采用时间条件傅里叶层捕获多尺度模式，基于流匹配实现高效确定性采样。

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进基线，谱分析显示多尺度动力学恢复效果更好，效率研究表明其参数和内存需求低于基于注意力或卷积的回归器。

Conclusion: 流匹配为PDE动力学预测提供了自然替代方案，TempO通过创新的架构设计实现了高效、高保真的多尺度动力学预测。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

TL;DR: DLER通过改进RL优化方法解决推理语言模型输出过长问题，使用简单的截断长度惩罚，在保持准确性的同时将输出长度减少70%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理语言模型（如OpenAI-o1、DeepSeek-R1等）虽然性能强大，但生成不必要冗长的输出，需要提高每个token的智能效率。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单截断长度惩罚，解决RL优化中的优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号问题。

Result: DLER在保持准确性的同时将输出长度减少70%以上，在7B模型上比DeepSeek-R1准确率提高28%且延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER实现了最先进的准确率-效率权衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法，在数据稀缺场景下保持基线准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Conclusion: 该框架是机械通气优化和个性化的重要步骤，为模拟MV决策效果提供了基于实证和博弈论元素的方法

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，具有计算可靠、速度快的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型离散支撑集上多模态和重尾概率质量函数的非参数估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在挑战。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化处理。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法，但存在已知的失效模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁，在不同样本量下表现稳健，因其可靠性和速度适合自动化流程和大规模探索性分析。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究全球恐怖主义数据库(GTD)中恐怖主义事件周计数的短期预测，旨在建立一个可复现的预测管道，并评估双向LSTM相对于传统基准模型的表现。

Method: 构建可复现的预测管道，使用基于时间的固定分割，比较双向LSTM与季节性朴素、线性/ARIMA模型以及深度LSTM-Attention基线。进行消融实验分析时间记忆、训练历史长度、空间粒度、回看窗口和特征组的影响。

Result: 双向LSTM在测试集上表现最佳，RMSE为6.38，相比LSTM-Attention提升30.6%，相比线性滞后回归基线提升35.4%。长历史数据训练、中等回看窗口(20-30周)和双向编码对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为GTD事件预测提供了一个透明且超越基线的参考框架，双向LSTM在捕获窗口内的积累和后续模式方面表现优异，短期结构特征贡献最大。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Result: 理论证明一个LQR的最优策略可以作为相关LQR任务的近最优初始化，保持原有收敛速率；新算法在连续时间LQR中实现了全局线性和局部超线性收敛。

Conclusion: 填补了连续时间强化学习中迁移学习的理论空白，将离散时间的研究扩展到连续时间，并建立了与连续时间扩散模型的联系。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征学习（神经网络在训练过程中调整内部表示）的机制仍然缺乏深入理解，需要发展理论框架来揭示有限宽度网络中特征学习的涌现现象。

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导自洽平均场理论，分析双层非线性网络在随机梯度朗之万动力学训练下的贝叶斯后验，并在基本平均场理论基础上引入自增强输入特征选择机制。

Result: 在无限宽度下理论简化为核岭回归，但在有限宽度下预测到对称性破缺相变，网络突然与目标函数对齐。基本平均场理论能半定量预测特征学习的出现，但低估了相变后泛化性能的提升。加入自增强输入特征选择机制后，理论能定量匹配学习曲线。

Conclusion: 自增强输入特征选择是特征学习的关键机制，将其纳入平均场理论能提供对特征学习的机理理解，并准确预测网络的学习行为。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 传统工具如DXA T-score和FRAX在髋部骨折风险评估中缺乏敏感性，特别是对于无既往骨折或骨量减少的高风险人群，需要更准确的预测方法

Method: 使用MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据，构建两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段整合DXA衍生特征进行精炼

Result: 模型经过严格验证，在不同队列中表现一致且适应性强，相比T-score和FRAX具有更高敏感性和更少漏诊病例

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

### [164] [Dissecting Mahalanobis: How Feature Geometry and Normalization Shape OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15202)
*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了表示几何和归一化对基于马氏距离的OOD检测方法性能的影响，提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法来改善OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然马氏距离方法被广泛用于OOD检测，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这可能限制其下游应用。

Method: 进行了全面的实证研究，分析了不同图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案；定义了理想的数据表示几何；提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法，通过可调参数直接控制特征空间的径向几何。

Result: 研究表明马氏距离方法并非普遍可靠；光谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型的OOD性能；提出的径向缩放ℓ2归一化能显著改善OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过弥合表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

### [165] [ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15211)
*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ReasonIF基准来评估大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型在该方面表现较差，并通过推理指令微调(RIF)方法提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究主要评估模型主要回答的指令遵循能力，但作者认为在推理过程中遵循用户指令对于大型推理模型的可控性、透明度和安全性同样至关重要。

Method: 构建了ReasonIF基准，包含六类指令提示（多语言推理、格式和长度控制等），并探索了多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种策略来提升推理指令遵循能力。

Result: 测试多个开源大型推理模型（GPT-OSS、Qwen3、DeepSeek-R1等）发现推理指令遵循得分普遍低于0.25，任务难度增加时表现进一步下降。RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的指令遵循得分从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力存在显著不足，RIF方法能够有效提升这一能力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究发现，不同基础模型在可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）后的推理性能差异源于其内部对规则合理性的感知能力。高潜力模型能区分严格规则与噪声规则的概率分布，而弱模型则无法区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同预训练模型在RLVR后的推理性能差异如此显著，寻找导致这种差异的微观特性。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，通过跨层稀疏自编码器提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则进行合理性分类。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有合理性感知能力，其内部概率分布在严格规则与噪声规则间存在显著差异，而弱模型则无法区分。引入SAL指标可准确预测RLVR后推理性能（R²=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分合理知识与不合理知识的内在能力相关，这为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了实用指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

TL;DR: 利用MIMIC-III数据库中214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，通过集成学习方法构建脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊室场景下取得了优异的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在真实急诊室场景下辅助诊断脑膜炎的AI工具，提高脑膜炎的临床诊断效率。

Method: 采用两阶段特征选择方法筛选临床相关特征，使用随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，通过集成学习将基础模型输出堆叠到逻辑回归元模型中。

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上均表现出色：测试集1的AUC为0.9637，测试集2的AUC为0.9472。

Conclusion: 虽然直接将诊断工具部署给临床医生使用仍具挑战性，但该研究为未来基于集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

### [170] [Stress-Aware Learning under KL Drift via Trust-Decayed Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15222)
*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在分布漂移下的序列决策方法——熵正则化信任衰减，通过注入压力感知的指数倾斜来更新信念和决策，实现了在KL漂移路径长度下的动态遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳，需要开发能够适应分布变化的鲁棒算法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入压力感知的指数倾斜，建立了Fenchel对偶等价性，并定义了脆弱性、信念带宽和决策空间脆弱性指数等鲁棒性度量。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度S_T下的动态遗憾保证为Õ(√T)，实现了O(1)的每切换遗憾，而无压力更新会导致Ω(1)的尾部损失。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一个单一的压力自适应更新方法，并扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈、异常值处理等多个场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害关系特性，在真实金融应用中部署LLM具有挑战性，需要评估其可信度。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准，基于实际情境设计广泛的对齐问题，并为每个可信度评估维度提供细粒度任务。

Result: 评估11个LLM，发现专有模型如o4-mini在安全性等大多数任务中表现更好，开源模型如DeepSeek-V3在行业级公平性等特定领域有优势，但所有模型在受托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务上都表现不足。

Conclusion: FinTrust可以作为金融领域LLM可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLM在法律意识方面存在显著差距，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: 提出了TESSERA方法，通过结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠的、信息丰富的、自适应的不确定性量化，在分布偏移下仍能保持接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖-宽度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中的蛋白质-配体亲和力预测，面临检测噪声异质性、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA方法结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供具有可靠覆盖保证的逐样本不确定性，生成信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度，能够追踪绝对误差。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA实现了接近名义的覆盖率和最佳的覆盖-宽度权衡（CWC指标），同时保持竞争力的适应性（最低AUSE）。尺寸分层覆盖进一步确认区间大小合适。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现流程和其他应用中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展强化学习到更一般的非可验证任务（通常以人类偏好对形式存在）仍然具有挑战性且研究不足。

Method: 提出双权重强化学习框架，集成链式思维推理与Bradley-Terry模型，使用实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数来近似最大似然目标。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思维过程。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Motivation: 准确预测禽类疾病暴发对野生动物保护和公共卫生至关重要，需要开发有效的早期预警系统。

Method: 整合GPS追踪数据、疫情记录和地理空间数据，使用H3地理空间编码处理坐标，通过Transformer模型学习候鸟移动序列的时空依赖关系。

Result: 在测试集上表现优异：准确率0.9821，AUC 0.9803，平均精度0.9299，F1分数0.8836。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测早期预警系统中具有巨大潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移下显著提升模型性能，同时保持原始分布上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估下性能下降的问题，因为这些方法只优化单一评估分布下的期望性能。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用。

Result: 在形式化改写、代码调试和翻译任务中显著提升性能，例如BIG-Bench形式化改写准确率从61.3%提升到85-90%，代码调试在领域偏移下提升约25个百分点。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，提供了一种即插即用的通用方法，在现实世界不确定性下实现可靠、可迁移的提示对齐。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现代尺度不变架构中，训练很快进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，导致有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP的学习率传递能力。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，保持子层增益在宽度变化时不变。基于奇异值谱的观察，提出经验性权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，结合向量参数在η₁=Θ_d(1)和λ₁=0的训练。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，实现了学习率和权重衰减从代理宽度到目标宽度的零样本迁移，无需逐宽度调参。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

TL;DR: RIC-TSC框架将因果发现融入时间序列分类，在格陵兰冰上湖演化预测中比相关性方法准确率提升12.59%，展示了因果建模在地球观测中的泛化优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测中的时空模型通常依赖相关性特征，在异质域间迁移性差。因果建模能发现稳定不变的关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+进行区域感知的因果发现，识别特定区域和不变预测因子及其时间滞后，然后输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在两个对比融化季节的1000个标记湖泊数据集上，因果模型在分布外评估中比基于相关性的基线准确率高12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化和机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性感知伪标签框架能够有效缓解不可靠伪标签的影响，在半监督回归任务中取得了优越的性能。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sxq/Heteroscedastic-Pseudo-Labels.

Result: 识别了基础模型在科学发现中的当前应用、新兴能力以及相关风险

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化科学范式的转变，需要科学界理解其变革性作用并反思科学发现的未来

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法能适应不同应用场景，可与不同模型耦合并使用替代的集成数据同化方法

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA突出了其在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化性质，特别是如何通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需的特征数量，从而提高学习效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的采样方案生成特征，包括普通采样方案和杠杆加权方案，并提出了寻找近似核然后应用杠杆加权采样的算法。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数量边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有有限秩时甚至改进为Ω(1)。对于Lipschitz损失，边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。

Conclusion: 加权RFLAF在显著减少特征数量的情况下实现了与普通采样RFLAF相同的性能，验证了理论结果和该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Result: 在各种对抗设置下的广泛实验表明，该方法在抵御多种图对抗攻击方面始终表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoE架构提供了一个可扩展的统一框架，能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，解决了现有单点防御方法的局限性。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法为序列建模提供了新的算子理论视角，通过谱分解和MMD梯度流的结合实现了可扩展的建模和快速采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Motivation: 现有零样本RL方法（如FB表示）存在表示表达能力不足的问题，且离线学习中的OOD动作会导致表示偏差，最终影响性能。

Method: 引入行为正则化将策略优化转化为稳定的样本内学习；使用任务条件扩散模型提取策略以生成高质量多模态动作分布；采用注意力架构增强表示建模能力。

Conclusion: BREEZE通过同时增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，显著提升了零样本RL的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一种高效算法，通过小流块级联微调预训练流，具有更简单/快速的子模型训练、降低的计算/内存成本以及基于Wasserstein信任区域的可证明稳定性。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前电解质研究面临两个基本挑战：缺乏高质量标准化基准，以及混合物系统中几何结构和分子间相互作用建模不足。

Method: 首先重组并增强CALiSol和DiffMix电解质数据集，加入分子几何图表示；然后提出GeoMix框架，其核心是几何交互网络(GIN)，这是一个专门为分子间几何消息传递设计的等变模块。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信仰'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上获得衰减率，ELBO比受限摊销后验获得的界限更紧。

Conclusion: 该方法在物理系统数值近似上表现良好，与可比方法竞争性相当，提供了一种无需判别器的有效训练框架。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型处于低基数类是一个更弱的假设，在此情况下最大似然估计可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文老虎机中的离线模仿学习，提出一种基于低基数奖励模型假设的新方法，学习复杂度与奖励类基数呈对数关系。

Result: 证明了最大似然方法在此情况下可能失败，而新方法在样本复杂度上具有对数优势。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越最大似然估计的方法，本文提出的基于低基数奖励模型假设的方法是一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实临床数据集上，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估等指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性方案训练不稳定性的同时，实现了良好的反事实预测性能。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Motivation: 传统强化学习需要开发模拟器和手动设计奖励函数，这通常耗时费力。OffSim旨在直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励结构，避免这些人工成本。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数，增强探索性和奖励泛化能力。OffSim+扩展支持多数据集设置，引入边际奖励进一步改善探索。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够有效从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现离线策略训练，为强化学习提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了SESA（顺序采样框架），通过顺序生成多样化的解决方案草图来缓解强化学习中探索受限和熵崩溃问题，显著提升LLM的推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在训练大语言模型时存在探索受限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。并行采样方法中多个输出来自相同分布，容易收敛到相似解。

Method: SESA框架：首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后顺序扩展为完整的推理路径。通过将每个新输出基于先前输出进行条件化，确保更广泛的探索，促进过程多样性，防止策略崩溃。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，SESA将成功率分别提升了+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相对于基线RL最高达211%的相对改进）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用PMI的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态最优相似度度量应对应于点互信息。

Method: 利用再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来近似PMI，提出KME-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论上证明该方法能以任意精度逼近PMI，实证表明在多个检索和分类任务中整体优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP有效改进了多模态对比预训练框架的相似度计算机制。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MC Dropout被广泛用于估计模型不确定性，但其在识别分割错误（特别是肿瘤边界附近）方面的有效性尚不清楚。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下（无增强、水平翻转、旋转、缩放）进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数与像素级错误进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。虽然不同增强设置间的差异具有统计显著性（p<0.001），但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供的线索有限，强调了在医学图像分割中需要替代或混合不确定性估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)描述了训练后第一层权重Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均(AGOP)的幂次关系，需要验证其在不同网络架构下的有效性。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化假设，理论分析L层线性网络的NFA性质。对于不平衡初始化，分析权重衰减下的渐近行为。通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了在L≥2层线性网络中NFA成立且指数α=1/L，显示了深度依赖性。对于不平衡初始化，在权重衰减下NFA渐近成立。发现了非线性激活网络的反例。

Conclusion: NFA在深度线性网络中具有深度依赖特性，但在非线性网络中可能不成立，这为理解深度神经网络特征学习机制提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上进行迭代消息传递，并应用簇内和簇间注意力机制来关注关键变量和簇。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型相比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的联合图神经网络在#SAT问题上表现出优越性能，通过注意力机制有效提升了推理精度。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一种无需训练的高效推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化策略，显著降低语义Top-K选择任务的延迟和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义Top-K选择在边缘AI服务中延迟和内存需求过高，而实际上只需要相对排名而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，提供了剪枝机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播方法，通过维护全局候选视图进行渐进式聚类剪枝，并采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略来重叠I/O与计算，限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存减少达94.9%，精度无损失；在实际应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存减少18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名和序列级稀疏性，显著提升了边缘设备上语义Top-K选择的效率和可部署性。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CQD-SHAP框架，通过Shapley值计算复杂查询中各部分对答案排名的贡献，提高神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂查询回答方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询不同部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论的Shapley值，计算查询各部分对特定答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动化评估中，与多种基线方法比较，证明该方法对大多数查询类型有效。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP框架能够有效解释复杂查询回答中查询各部分的重要性，增强用户对神经预测器从非完整知识图谱推断新知识价值的理解。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽视PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态和超出训练时间范围的泛化问题。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器空间离散化输入函数，神经ODE捕捉潜在时间动态，解码器重构物理空间解。提出物理编码的神经ODE来融入PDE特定物理属性。

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应不同编码器/解码器的灵活性，能够跨相关PDE族泛化，作为科学机器学习中可扩展的物理编码工具具有潜力。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Motivation: Tsetlin机器在CPU等资源受限设备上具有高速推理能力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行

Method: 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制；提出字面量重排序策略最大化提前退出概率

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验显示，推理时间相比传统整数实现减少96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度

Conclusion: 通过位运算、提前退出和字面量重排序的组合优化，显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理效率

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs存在训练计算成本高、对多输入逻辑块泛化能力差的问题，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs)方法，通过概率查找表结合Walsh变换辅助松弛技术来学习逻辑门组合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上相比DLGNs实现显著更快的收敛速度，同时保持可比的准确率，且可训练参数大幅减少。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为现代FPGA上的高效部署提供了有前景的方法，具有扩展到更高输入逻辑块的潜力，适用于实时科学应用。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来提升推理任务的性能，无需重新训练LLM，在相同精度下可减少4倍采样次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法如Best-of-N采样存在效率递减问题，需要更高效的测试时校准方法来提升推理性能。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后学习输入特定的温度T和偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024实验中，CarBoN在相同精度下减少4倍采样次数，且在固定预算下通常达到更高精度。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提升了测试时推理效率，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，并可推广到束搜索等步级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更高效的数据驱动替代方法。

Method: 开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与多种经典算法进行对比评估，使用包含9000个样本的平衡数据集进行10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法实现100%准确率，KS-Net模型达到99.98%准确率，仅有两个误分类。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法能够高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为电机设计加速、自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定约束，导致生成的对抗样本在实际应用中不可行或容易被检测，限制了其真实世界适用性。

Method: 提出CAP算法，基于增强拉格朗日最小最大优化问题，使用梯度交替优化策略来强制执行多个复杂约束。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: CAP方法能够有效处理约束特征空间中的对抗攻击，并可通过数据学习特征约束，在结构化输入空间中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的模型，能够自动简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，显著压缩证明长度并提高验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经定理证明生成的证明过于冗长，难以被人理解，限制了数学洞察力。证明简化是关键瓶颈，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程逐步减少证明长度。

Result: ProofOptimizer在标准基准测试中显著压缩证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中检查更快，作为训练数据还能提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，有效解决了证明冗长问题，提高了证明的可理解性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 解决强化学习系统的安全性问题，开发既能达到最优性能又能提供形式化安全保证的RL系统。

Method: 通过风险预算增强约束MDP状态空间，使用学习到的成本评论器对智能体策略分布应用屏蔽机制，确保所有采样动作在期望上保持安全。

Result: 在实验中证明，在温和且实际可实现的假设下，ProSh即使在训练期间也能保证安全性，并提供了仅依赖于备份评论器准确度的紧致期望成本上界。

Conclusion: ProSh提供了一种有效的模型无关安全强化学习方法，能够在训练过程中确保安全性，同时在确定性环境中保持最优性能。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要解决手动奖励工程的问题。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包含静态方法（直接使用学到的奖励函数优化策略）和动态方法（迭代更新奖励函数和策略直到收敛）。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中，该方法能够学习处理时序依赖任务的有效策略，性能优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法（如奖励机器和LTL引导方法）。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，为传统奖励建模提供了可扩展、高效且不依赖人工的替代方案，并提供了收敛保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，深度学习模型可以成为解决方案，但需要选择能准确模拟FEA的架构。

Method: 引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（先在数据上预训练，再进行物理信息微调），比较GNN和3D U-Net的性能。

Result: GNN从根本上优于U-Net，MPNN和Graph Transformer分别达到3.5%和2.6%的相对L2误差，PINN框架将误差最多降低11.3%，但Graph Transformer推理速度比MPNN慢37.5%。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经崩溃方法设计的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改进了模型校准。提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统的一个有前景的进展，能够同时提升准确性和预测的可靠性

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中意外表现出色，作者发现这主要源于将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，因此希望系统研究这种方法的有效性。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，在Lookahead优化器的两循环框架中，对多个内部优化器步骤产生的伪梯度应用Nesterov动量来更新慢权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中达到1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，训练规模可达1e23 FLOPs，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增加。

Conclusion: SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为适用于各种内部优化器（包括AdamW和Muon）的实用增强方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低。在量子电路编译过程中，特别是路由阶段，如何提高过程保真度是关键挑战。传统方法依赖间接指标如电路深度或门数量，无法直接优化保真度。

Conclusion: FIDDLE框架通过直接优化过程保真度，在量子电路路由阶段实现了比传统方法更好的性能，为噪声量子设备的可靠性提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了有前景的架构，目前正在收集跨物种转录组/表型数据以进行实验验证。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

TL;DR: 本文识别并解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中存在的错误透明度问题，提出了一种名为NGS的方法，通过在训练过程中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度，从而减少错误透明伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS重建的不透明物体经常出现虚假透明表面，导致在交互式观看时背景和内部图案不一致。这个问题源于3DGS中的不适定优化，缺乏对表面不透明度的显式约束。

Method: 提出NGS策略，通过在物体体积中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯采用更高不透明度，仅需对现有泼溅过程进行最小修改。同时提出了基于透射率的度量来定量评估错误透明度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NGS显著减少了错误透明度，同时在标准渲染指标上保持了竞争力。

Conclusion: NGS方法有效解决了3DGS中的错误透明度问题，提高了重建质量，特别是在物体中心重建的交互式观看场景中。

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署的语言模型需要处理不完整信息和不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 开发了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型，要求模型综合大量背景信息并以概率先验形式表达预测，评估其准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试显示，模型产生的先验通常不准确且过度自信，性能仅随不确定性引出方式略有改善，但不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

TL;DR: HugAgent是一个用于评估AI模型如何适应个体推理风格的基准测试，包含合成和人类双轨设计，旨在推动机器推理与人类个体思维的对接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然能模拟人类响应，但偏向群体共识，忽略了推理风格和信念轨迹的个体差异。需要开发能捕捉个体推理演变过程的评估方法。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于大规模系统性压力测试，人类轨道收集生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据。通过给定个体过去观点证据，预测其在新的场景中的推理和信念更新。

Result: 实验表明，最先进的LLM在适应个体推理方面仍存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的基准测试，用于对齐机器推理与人类思维的个体性。

Conclusion: HugAgent为评估机器推理与人类个体思维的对齐提供了首个可扩展基准，揭示了当前模型在捕捉个体推理演变方面的局限性，推动了更人性化AI推理的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中情绪识别因缺乏大规模、长期自然收集数据集而面临的挑战，捕捉COVID-19疫情期间的情绪响应。

Method: 使用深度学习面部表情识别技术收集员工面部表情数据，计算7种基础情绪概率和32种扩展情绪指标，包括效价、唤醒度、波动性等。

Result: 数据集成功复现已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提升192%，p<0.001），完美预测员工流动率（AUC=1.0），基线实验达到91.2%情绪分类准确率和R2=0.84的效价预测性能。

Conclusion: 这是目前公开可用的最大、最长期的工作场所情绪数据集，为情绪识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染等研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

### [235] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应该采用非对称权重和持续性测试，将通用智能理解为稳态属性集群，而非简单的多领域能力总和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，与人类智能研究不符；快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：基于因果中心性的权重评分（采用CHC理论权重）和集群稳定性指数系列（评估配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正）。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了可测试的预测和黑盒协议。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被理解为稳态属性集群，AGI评估需要加权域重要性和测试能力持久性，以更准确地衡量真实智能水平。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM代理与知识图谱交互的多维数据分析方法，构建动态协作的分析生态系统，在生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索分析方面具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量、异构、复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLMs在自然语言处理方面表现良好但存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，KGs能显式存储结构化知识但静态特性限制了动态交互和分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM代理从非结构化数据中自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索和分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动的探索性分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新的思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个基于知识图谱的GUI智能体框架，通过将像素级交互构建为状态-动作知识图谱来解决API缺失环境下的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素交互构建为持久的状态-动作知识图谱(SA-KG)，通过链接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态，并设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂GUI决策环境中，相比现有方法在探索效率和策略深度方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过知识图谱结构有效解决了API缺失环境下智能体的探索效率和长期规划问题，为GUI智能体提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成的智能体系统主要关注文本信息的存储，忽视了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆的多模态特性启发，作者希望构建一个符合认知科学中人类记忆理念的多模态智能体系统。

Method: 系统包含4个循环连接的阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储到记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）和行动（执行任务）。不同于使用向量数据库的现有系统，作者将信息概念化为语义标签，并将其与上下文关联存储在图结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现高效的概念驱动检索。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中，系统比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍；在MSC基准测试中，系统性能优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: AUGUSTUS系统通过模拟人类记忆的多模态特性，采用图结构的语义标签记忆机制，在多模态任务中实现了更高效和更优的性能表现。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要原因是视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR提取结构化视觉先验，结合多个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合生成高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级评论模型，最终选择最高分答案作为精炼结果。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据的模型性能均优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态模型的监督微调数据质量，评论模型在保持高效的同时展现出与先进LMM相当的能力。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但存在响应过长和过度思考的问题，导致推理延迟和计算消耗增加，特别是对于简单任务。

Method: 提出DEPO框架，包含三个核心组件：解耦优势算法指导减少低效token、难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度、优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上优于基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架有效解决了大推理模型中的低效推理问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡布线效率和面积效率，满足工业标准要求，为模拟IC布局提供了实用的布线感知解决方案。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI训练过程中，部分学习的目标往往会激励AI避免进一步的目标更新，因为大多数目标通过继续追求能更好地实现。可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要，是重要的安全属性。

Method: 通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测，然后根据这些预测确定接受更新时的奖励，构建任何可修正目标的修正版本。该方法可递归扩展到修正代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标可以有效地学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 本文提供了可修正性的正式定义和转换方法，能够在保持性能的同时实现目标的可修正性，这对AI安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习结合战略游戏中的自博弈是开发LLMs可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线显著提高了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中一个关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架为解决判断不一致性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

*Usman Ali,Ali Zia,Waqas Ali,Umer Ramzan,Abdul Rehman,Muhammad Tayyab Chaudhry,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于电机故障诊断，通过超图拓扑和对比学习融合多模态传感器数据，实现高精度、强泛化能力的多故障诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。需要一种能够同时诊断轴承、定子和转子故障的鲁棒诊断方法。

Method: MM-HCAN将对比学习集成到专门为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中达到99.82%的准确率，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，适用于实际部署。消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为工业环境中的全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制来改进SQL候选查询选择的新框架，解决了现有方法在语义区分和推理链稳定性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL任务中，从多样化候选池中选择正确查询成为新的瓶颈。传统方法如自一致性和最佳N解码只能提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，且无法捕捉细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL评判模型，通过强化学习蒸馏可验证奖励指导的推理轨迹；构建加权共识锦标赛机制，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化性以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，显著提升了SQL候选选择的可靠性和效率，为文本到SQL任务提供了更准确和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

*Lavanya Umapathy,Patricia M Johnson,Tarun Dutt,Angela Tong,Madhur Nayan,Hersh Chandarana,Daniel K Sodickson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别适用于就诊次数有限且频率不规律的情况。该模型先基于最近就诊数据评估初始疾病风险，然后利用历史影像和临床生物标志物信息进行修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要。当患者历史就诊次数有限且频率不规律时，整合这些时间背景信息可以提高健康监测的准确性。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段机器学习框架：首先使用最近就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险，然后利用从先前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物中提取的信息来完善风险评估。

Result: 在前列腺癌风险预测中，整合历史背景信息直接将假阳性转化为真阴性，在保持高灵敏度的同时提高了特异性。当整合最多三次先前影像检查信息时，假阳性率从51%降至33%；当同时包含先前临床数据时，进一步降至24%。对于五年内前列腺癌风险预测，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，能够增强医学风险预测的特异性。对于各种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率可以为扩展纵向健康监测项目提供途径，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"草图-填充"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，开发Thoth模型通过分阶段知识到行动过程训练

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面实现显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，将知识与实验执行连接起来

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进RLHF的方法，通过引入多响应排序和考虑用户异质性偏好，解决了传统方法中二元比较的局限性和统一用户偏好假设的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发了DPO的EM变体，发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大后悔公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中公平性和个性化的理论和算法框架，确保在多样用户群体中的公平性能保证。

Conclusion: 通过多响应排序和异质性偏好整合，为生成模型对齐提供了更公平和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and

management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise

Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：训练时需要同步所有模态数据，推理时依赖所有模态数据，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线提升16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升4.86和2.30个百分点。

Conclusion: TRIP框架实现了最先进的性能，展示了其有效性和适应性，能够灵活处理训练和推理时的模态要求。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多维问题（如司法框架、环境治理等）时，现有LLM缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制，需要一种方法来增强AI代理在这些开放不可验证领域中的专业能力。

Method: 提出Dialectica框架，让代理在定义主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Result: 在两个模型架构上的实验显示，启用基于反思的上下文编辑的代理在Elo评分、标准化Bradley-Terry-Davidson能力和AlphaRank质量上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是增强AI代理在开放不可验证领域中目标专业知识的可行路径，定量和定性证据一致支持这一结论。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.
