### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来增强多模态大语言模型，在无需人工标注的情况下实现场景图生成和动作定位，显著提升具身智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本配对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义之间的细粒度结构化对齐，限制了具身智能体的感知能力。

Method: 开发了SGClip模型，这是一种基于CLIP的、开放域、可提示的场景图生成模型，通过神经符号学习管道在87K+开放域视频上进行训练，利用视频-字幕对和结构化推理实现自监督学习。

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，ESCA框架显著提升了开源和商业MLLM的性能，在两个具身环境中达到最先进水平，大幅减少感知错误并使开源模型超越专有基线。

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效增强了多模态大语言模型，证明了自监督场景图生成在提升具身智能体感知能力方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CrossRay3D的稀疏多模态3D检测器，通过Ray-Aware Supervision和Class-Balanced Supervision提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准测试中达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，且运行速度快1.84倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视了token表示质量，导致前景质量次优和性能受限。研究发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，核心模块包括：Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)在训练阶段保持丰富几何信息；Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义显著性；Ray Positional Encoding解决LiDAR和图像模态间的分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失场景下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器计算效率优势的同时，显著提升了3D检测性能，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡监督的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个利用街头CCTV流进行多缺陷检测和分割的综合管道，使用YOLO目标检测器和视觉语言模型生成结构化维修计划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增加，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只能处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果

Method: 使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成JSON格式的结构化行动计划

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IAD-GPT，一种基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分发挥大模型在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识增强像素级异常感知。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功结合了文本语义与图像信息，为工业异常检测提供了有效的多模态解决方案，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响，发现AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化报告和人工智能可能改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，但需要评估不同报告模式对实际工作流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究，使用定制化查看器和眼动追踪系统，让4名新手和4名非新手读者分析35张床旁胸片，比较三种报告模式的诊断准确性、报告时间、眼动指标和用户体验。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域，且是最受偏好的模式。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的框架IFEF来分析图像分类中的交叉偏见，并开发了BWA数据增强方法来缓解这些偏见，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提升了弱势群体的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在非平衡数据集上训练时经常表现出交叉偏见，这些偏见源于多个属性（如物体类别和环境条件）的交互作用，需要系统性的分析和缓解方法。

Method: 提出了交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具来识别偏见模式，并开发了基于子群分布统计的自适应数据增强策略BWA。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA方法将弱势群体分类准确率提升了最高24个百分点，公平性指标差异减少了35%，统计显著性得到确认(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可复现的方法来分析并解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见问题。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的神经网络量化方法，支持多比特对数量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅用15个训练周期即可达到与全精度模型相差不到1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分方法，学习能力有限；二是移位/对数量化要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。本文旨在提供可微分且收敛到最优网络的量化方法。

Method: 采用可微分的量化方法，支持n比特量化，特别是对数形式的2^n量化。该方法在反向传播中提供真实的导数，而非手动设置，并提供了收敛性证明。

Result: 在ImageNet图像分类任务中，仅权重量化时准确率与全精度模型相差不到1%；权重和激活同时量化时，准确率与最先进方法相当。训练仅需15个周期，推理成本略高于1比特量化但无需高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可微分、收敛到最优的量化方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著减少了训练时间和计算资源需求。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

### [8] [GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16136)
*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于通用引导的训练无关方法，通过周期性添加引导来改进3D外观迁移，在几何差异大的情况下仍能成功传输纹理和几何细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入和外观对象几何差异显著时效果不佳，直接应用3D生成模型无法产生吸引人的结果，需要更有效的外观迁移方法。

Method: 使用预训练的整流流模型，在采样过程中周期性地添加可微分损失函数作为引导，包括部件感知损失和自相似性损失。

Result: 方法成功将纹理和几何细节传输到输入3D资产，在定性和定量评估中都优于基线方法，并通过GPT评估系统验证了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，为3D外观迁移提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

*Jianhan Lin,Yuchu Qin,Shuai Gao,Yikang Rui,Jie Liu,Yanjie Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StripRFNet用于道路损坏检测，通过形状感知、条状感受野和小尺度增强三个模块，在RDD2022基准测试中达到最先进性能，F1分数80.33%，同时保持实时推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路损坏检测对实现可持续发展目标11至关重要，但现有方法面临损坏形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉、小尺度损坏识别错误率高等挑战。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块（SPM）通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条状感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条状卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，中国子集的F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；完整数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，优于CRDDC'2022参与者和ORDDC'2024 Phase 2结果，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet在准确性和实时效率方面达到最先进水平，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

*Xiangyu Mu,Dongliang Zhou,Jie Hou,Haijun Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将假人模特视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假人模特展示服装成本低但缺乏真实感和表现细节，需要开发能够生成逼真人类视频的方法来改善在线时尚展示。

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器，基于DDIM的一步去噪处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo能够有效解决假人到人类视频生成中的关键挑战，为在线时尚展示提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过在训练和推理时对物体进行特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测不确定性的技术，包括颜色空间扰动和扩散模型生成多样化行人实例，显著提升了检测精度和不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响，需要一种方法来量化和减少这种不确定性。

Method: 在训练时对单个物体进行颜色空间扰动以增强对光照和颜色变化的鲁棒性，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的物体应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上使用YOLOv8的实验表明，该方法在所有物体类别上都带来了显著的精度提升和不确定性减少，在推理时对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理时分别具有减少和量化基于视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

Motivation: 医学图像标注数据有限，半监督学习具有吸引力。现有的师生框架在联合优化整个网络时存在收敛性和稳定性问题，特别是在挑战性场景下。

Method: 提出DuetMatch框架：1) 双分支异步优化，每个分支分别优化编码器或解码器；2) 解耦dropout扰动增强噪声条件下的鲁棒性；3) 成对CutMix交叉引导通过增强输入对交换伪标签；4) 一致性匹配使用冻结教师模型的稳定预测来优化伪标签。

Conclusion: DuetMatch通过创新的双分支异步优化架构和多种正则化技术，有效解决了医学图像半监督分割中的收敛稳定性和噪声鲁棒性问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了优越性能。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主导航C臂到预定义解剖标志的管道，利用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合不确定度估计和保形预测确保可靠性。


<details>

Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定度，在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上训练。

Result: 在多个架构上显示出强大的定位精度，同时具有良好校准的预测边界，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力作为安全可靠的自主C臂系统的组成部分，能够减少辐射暴露并提高手术效率。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量仍达不到传统摄影标准，手动图像质量评估过程缓慢且昂贵，需要自动预过滤来降低IQA工作量

Method: 开发了一个估计成本节省的公式，并在背景修复用例中使用简单的AutoML解决方案进行验证

Result: 在背景修复用例中实现了51.61%的成本节省

Conclusion: 自动预过滤IQA系统可以显著降低获取高质量图像的平均成本

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大脑如何编码视觉信息是神经科学和机器学习的重要挑战。当前从fMRI信号重建图像的方法依赖于将fMRI信号转换到潜在空间，但哪种潜在空间最适合这种转换以及如何有效组织该空间来表征视觉刺激仍不明确。

Method: 提出PRISM模型，包含：1）将fMRI信号投影到结构化文本空间作为中间表示；2）对象中心扩散模块，通过组合单个对象生成图像以减少对象检测错误；3）属性关系搜索模块，自动识别与神经活动最匹配的关键属性和关系。

Conclusion: 使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，fMRI信号与语言模型的文本空间比基于视觉的空间或联合文本图像空间更相似。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态采样不同时空分辨率的视频并插值模型权重，使状态空间模型(SSM)能够无缝处理从短片段到长活动的各种视频，在动作识别任务中优于transformer和SSM基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对transformer设计，未能充分利用SSM的独特属性。固定分辨率和视频长度的训练导致模型在未见过的时空分辨率上性能下降，限制了模型处理不同长度视频的能力。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频SSM的策略。

Result: 在短动作(UCF-101, HMDB-51)和长动作(COIN, Breakfast)基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和SSM基线模型性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作(SSV2, Diving-48)上表现出强适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频SSM在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了一个强大的新架构范式，通过异构集成实现了性能提升和更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCSCC是头颈部最常见的癌症，早期症状不明显且生长缓慢，常常被忽视导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割和模式识别能力可以有效进行早期检测。

Method: 训练了一个CNN模型，使用4293张训练图像（包括良性和恶性肿瘤以及阴性样本），测试不同分辨率图像对预测准确性的影响，并设计了图像采集硬件系统。

Result: 随着图像分辨率的提高，预测准确性呈对数增长，显示出更高像素数带来的边际收益递减。开发了应用程序便于测试和开放访问。

Conclusion: CNN结合专用硬件系统可以有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响，但存在边际收益递减效应。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建方法提供了灵活、渐进的替代方案，能够利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索进行动态场景建模。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型的视频异常检测方法虽然具有优越的零样本检测能力，但计算成本巨大且视觉定位性能不稳定，阻碍了实时部署。

Method: 采用两阶段级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理。关键创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus在NVIDIA L40S GPU上平均达到57.68 fps，加速151.79倍，准确率达到97.2%，与最先进的VLM-based VAD方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus是一个实用的实时视频分析解决方案，在保持高精度的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

Motivation: 现有评估方法存在分布偏差问题，导致成员推断攻击的成功率被高估，需要建立一个无偏基准来准确评估隐私保护技术。

Method: 构建包含6000张图像的受控基准，其中成员和非成员样本分布经过仔细平衡，并提供三个不同训练阶段的真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明先前报告的高成功率主要源于数据集偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA为LVLM的MIA研究提供了透明无偏的基准，澄清了当前方法的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Conclusion: Stroke2Sketch框架能够自适应地整合参考笔画特征到内容图像中，同时保持结构完整性，实现了高质量的草图风格转换。

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

### [27] [Scaling Laws for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16320)
*Wenhao Wang,Longqi Cai,Taihong Xiao,Yuxiao Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律，发现检测误差随真实图像域数量和深度伪造方法数量的增加呈幂律衰减，类似于大语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有数据集规模不足，无法研究深度伪造检测的缩放规律，因此构建了ScaleDF这一最大规模的数据集来系统分析模型性能与训练数据规模的关系。

Method: 构建包含580万张真实图像（来自51个不同域）和880万张伪造图像（由102种深度伪造方法生成）的ScaleDF数据集，系统分析模型性能与真实域数量、伪造方法数量和训练图像数量的关系。

Result: 观察到平均检测误差随真实域数量或深度伪造方法数量的增加呈幂律衰减，这种缩放规律可用于预测达到目标性能所需的额外资源，并为对抗深度伪造技术提供数据中心的解决方案。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测任务存在明确的缩放规律，这种规律不仅有助于性能预测，还揭示了在对抗深度伪造技术时采用数据中心方法的重要性，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用及其局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

### [28] [Scale-DiT: Ultra-High-Resolution Image Generation with Hierarchical Local Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16325)
*Yuyao Zhang,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-DiT是一个用于超高分辨率文本到图像生成的扩散框架，通过分层局部注意力和低分辨率全局引导，实现了4K分辨率的高效图像合成，无需额外的高分辨率训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和缺乏原生4K训练数据，难以实现超高分辨率图像生成。

Method: 采用分层局部注意力机制，将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口，结合低分辨率潜在空间提供全局语义引导，使用LoRA适应连接全局和局部路径，并优化推理效率。

Result: Scale-DiT实现了2倍以上的推理速度提升和更低的内存使用，能够可靠地扩展到4K分辨率，在定量和定性评估中均优于依赖原生4K训练的先进方法。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力与引导低分辨率锚点是一种有前景且有效的方法，可推动超高分辨率图像生成的发展。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionX是一个云边协同框架，通过轻量级设备端模型快速生成预览图像，云端模型进行最终优化，结合噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载，显著降低生成时间并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成过程计算密集，用户需要多次迭代优化提示词，增加了延迟和云资源负担。

Method: 提出云边协同框架，设备端使用轻量扩散模型快速生成预览，云端使用高容量模型进行最终优化，并引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载。

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5平均生成时间减少15.8%，图像质量相当；相比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下实现了效率和可扩展性，为多轮提示词生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

### [30] [TokenAR: Multiple Subject Generation via Autoregressive Token-level enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16332)
*Haiyue Sun,Qingdong He,Jinlong Peng,Peng Tang,Jiangning Zhang,Junwei Zhu,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenAR框架通过token级增强机制解决多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，包含token索引嵌入、指令token注入和身份token解缠策略，显著提升了自回归模型在多主体生成中的身份一致性和背景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在多参考图像生成中难以解耦不同参考身份，存在身份混淆问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升身份一致性。

Method: 提出TokenAR框架，包含三个token级增强组件：1) Token Index Embedding聚类token索引以更好表示相同参考图像；2) Instruct Token Injection作为额外视觉特征容器注入详细补充先验；3) 身份token解缠策略(ITD)显式引导token表示独立表示每个身份特征。

Result: 该方法在多个参考图像生成任务中超越了当前最先进模型，实现了良好的身份一致性和高质量的背景重建。

Conclusion: TokenAR框架通过token级增强显著提升了自回归模型在多参考图像生成中的能力，同时开源了首个大规模多参考输入的InstructAR数据集用于训练和评估。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

### [31] [RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333)
*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型（MLLM）性能主要继承自LLM骨干的假设，重点分析了视觉编码器在RL训练范式下的重塑作用，并提出了高效的PIVOT训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究过度关注LLM骨干而忽视视觉编码器的作用，特别是在RL训练范式下，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的系统分析。

Method: 通过ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化等多样化实验，分析不同训练策略（SFT vs RL）对MLLM视觉表示的影响，并开发了PIVOT训练方法。

Result: RL相比SFT能产生更强且更精确定位的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能优于更大规模训练的对手，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器在MLLM中扮演关键角色，RL训练能有效重塑视觉表示，PIVOT方法为构建高效强大的MLLM视觉骨干开辟了新路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

*Bo Peng,Jie Lu,Guangquan Zhang,Zhen Fang*

TL;DR: 提出GradNorm框架，通过梯度范数来筛选与图像语义相近的正向名词，以改进语言辅助图像聚类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP特征空间的过滤策略缺乏理论基础，需要一种理论保证的方法来筛选语义相关的正向名词

Method: 基于梯度范数的框架，通过反向传播交叉熵损失的梯度大小来衡量名词的语义正性

Result: 理论证明GradNorm包含现有策略为特例，实验显示在多个基准测试中达到最先进的聚类性能

Conclusion: GradNorm为语言辅助图像聚类提供了理论保证的过滤方法，显著提升了聚类效果

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交制造模式面临质量控制的重大挑战，主要困难包括：产品高度定制化、生产涉及碎片化小批量订单、分布式站点成像环境差异大。需要克服真实世界数据集稀缺和定制算法缺乏的问题。

Method: 引入MIRAD数据集，捕捉社交制造的三个关键维度：多样化定制产品的大类内变异、来自6个地理分散制造节点的数据收集、显著的成像异质性（光照、背景、运动条件变化）。对SOTA异常检测方法进行广泛评估。

Result: 所有模型在MIRAD数据集上的性能相比传统基准都显著下降，突显了真实世界定制化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过连接工业需求和学术研究，为开发Industry 5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。该数据集已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a
domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model
on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out
center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于AR/VR边缘设备的实时手部姿态估计。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

TL;DR: LightGlueStick是一种轻量级的点和线段匹配器，通过注意力线消息传递机制实现高效的点线联合匹配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将点和线匹配视为独立任务，而GlueStick虽然实现了联合匹配但架构过重，无法满足实时应用或边缘设备部署需求。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递机制，在网络中显式暴露线的连通性，实现节点间高效通信，构建轻量级点线匹配架构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，同时保持了轻量级特性。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过创新的注意力线消息传递机制，成功实现了高效的点线联合匹配，为实时应用和边缘设备部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

*Haoran Sun,Chen Cai,Huiping Zhuang,Kong Aik Lee,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了可解释深度伪造视频检测任务和EDVD-LLaMA多模态大语言模型推理框架，通过时空细微信息标记化和细粒度多模态思维链机制，在准确检测的同时提供可追溯的推理过程和可信解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造视频检测方法存在原理不透明、泛化能力不足的问题，迫切需要能够识别伪造内容并提供可验证推理解释的检测器。

Method: 1. 时空细微信息标记化(ST-SIT)提取融合全局和局部跨帧深度伪造特征；2. 细粒度多模态思维链(Fg-MCoT)引入面部特征数据作为硬约束，实现像素级时空视频定位；3. 构建可解释推理FF++基准数据集(ER-FF++set)。

Conclusion: 相比之前的深度伪造视频检测方法，EDVD-LLaMA提供了更可解释且更优秀的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过创新的跨模态token聚合机制有效解决了细粒度动作识别中的对齐问题，为复杂多人场景下的交互式人类动作分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测框架在处理旋转目标时表现不佳，特别是在航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶等应用中，需要更准确地捕捉方向变化。

Method: 采用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离，提出各向异性高斯表示来解决类方形物体的各向同性方差问题，并集成旋转不变损失函数到现有深度学习检测器中。

Result: 在平均精度指标上相比现有方法有显著提升，证明了该方法在旋转目标检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为旋转目标检测建立了新的基准，对需要精确和可靠目标定位的应用具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并注入超越预训练子空间的新表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗巨大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，这在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺设置中尤为明显。

Method: VIPAMIN通过两个关键步骤增强自监督模型的适应：1）将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐；2）注入超越预训练子空间的新表示方向。该方法只需要单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN提供了一种简单而有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著增强自监督模型在下游任务中的适应能力，特别是在具有挑战性和数据稀缺的环境中。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督域自适应方法，利用稀疏点标注进行线粒体分割，通过多任务学习和跨教学机制提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜图像中线粒体实例分割标注成本高，无监督域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低，需要更有效的弱监督方法

Method: 多任务学习框架联合进行分割和中心检测，采用跨教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习，结合实例感知伪标签选择策略

Result: 在挑战性数据集上超越现有UDA和WDA方法，显著缩小与监督上界的性能差距

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督和完全无监督设置下都取得了显著改进，为生物医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖历史信息做决策，忽略了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的导航智能体。

Method: 使用Q学习训练Q模型生成描述潜在未来信息的Q特征，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，产生反映未来前景的行动评分，结合历史评分实现A*式搜索。

Result: 在广泛使用的目标导向VLN数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合未来信息预测和历史信息，有效提升了目标导向视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HGC-Avatar是一个用于动态3D虚拟人高效传输和高质量渲染的分层高斯压缩框架，通过结构层和运动层的解耦设计，在低比特率下实现更好的压缩效率和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的动态3D场景压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致比特率效率和重建质量不理想，限制了其在可流式3D虚拟人系统中的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（使用StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法，为快速3D虚拟人渲染提供了可流式解决方案。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和面部注意力机制，成功解决了动态虚拟人传输中的压缩效率和视觉质量平衡问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实世界科学论文中跨文本、图表、公式的多模态不一致性，这些问题会影响科学论文的清晰度、可重复性和可信度。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）收集真实不一致案例，设计三个任务：不一致识别、修正和配对匹配，并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先大模型进行测试，结果显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型和专有模型都难以应对多模态科学推理挑战。

Conclusion: 当前大模型在多模态科学推理方面能力有限，需要进一步开发可信赖的科学助手来解决跨模态不一致性问题。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Conclusion: 提出的OOS-DSD方法通过辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了多任务学习的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像分类和检索方法可能无法充分捕捉图像之间的复杂关系，需要一种能够利用图结构来建模图像相似性关系的方法。

Conclusion: 基于图注意力网络的自编码器方法能够有效建模图像间关系，通过代表模型实现准确的图像分类和检索。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重建和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要原因是文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系，这种局限性被主要将单词与视觉对象对齐的对比训练所强化。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重建目标：使用冻结的预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重建替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强的传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。将READ应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升这些基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 重建和对齐目标提供了互补优势：前者鼓励编码器捕获标题内单词间的关系，后者确保不同措辞表达的释义具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

<details>

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GaitRDAE通过动态区域感知方法有效提升了步态识别的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

*Guangyu Lin,Li Lin,Christina P. Walker,Daniel S. Schiff,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个基于真实世界政治深度伪造事件的基准测试，评估了现有深度伪造检测器在真实政治深度伪造内容上的表现，发现现有检测器泛化能力不足且易受简单攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散加剧了政治深度伪造的风险，但现有检测模型大多基于实验室合成数据训练，难以有效检测真实社交媒体上传播的政治深度伪造内容。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库构建系统基准，对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统性评估。

Result: 学术界和政府开发的检测器表现相对较差，付费检测工具性能较高但仍有局限，所有检测器对真实政治深度伪造泛化能力不足，在视频领域尤其脆弱。

Conclusion: 需要开发政治情境化的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过重新加权视觉标记、引入噪声衍生标记和应用对抗攻击来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但物体幻觉问题仍然是一个重大挑战。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将LVLM幻觉追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，采用三种策略：重新加权视觉标记以减少统计偏差，引入噪声衍生标记来对抗固有偏差，以及应用带有对比解码的对抗攻击来解决脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验表明，SHIELD能有效缓解不同基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题。此外，SHIELD在通用LVLM基准测试中表现强劲，显示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个有效的训练免费框架，能够显著减少大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，同时保持模型在通用任务上的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级即插即用的视觉token压缩框架，通过可学习的评分模块和可微Top-K机制，实现高效自适应的token选择，在各种压缩率下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有token压缩技术受限于启发式规则，容易丢弃关键信息并存在注意力偏差问题。

Method: 提出VisionSelector评分模块，与MLLM主干解耦，包含可微Top-K机制和课程退火策略，将token压缩重新定义为端到端可学习的决策过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上以30%保留预算保持100%准确率，在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度翻倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector在各种压缩预算下均表现优异，能够自适应识别关键token，实现高效且性能保持的token压缩。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Motivation: 解决在资源受限平台上实现视觉自主导航的挑战，特别是单目深度估计的度量精度问题和计算效率问题，使无人机能在无GPS的室内环境中可靠运行。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架，使用基于颜色的SVM教师网络生成训练数据，训练轻量级U-Net学生网络进行实时语义分割；开发自适应尺度因子算法将非度量深度预测转换为准确度量距离；通过端到端学习训练紧凑神经网络学习完整飞行策略。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，使系统能够部署在资源受限平台上。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，平均每个对话4轮，涵盖12个流行的VLM评估基准。该基准测试包含484个任务和交互目标，覆盖从事实知识到数学和编码等高级推理任务。使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，在37个关键方面评估18个VLM模型，发现即使最强模型在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮对话数据集（如MMDU、ConvBench）仅部分捕捉用户遇到的各种对话场景的广度和深度，而现实世界应用通常需要更复杂的多轮对话。

Method: 从12个流行的VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮。提出基于检查表的评估方法，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，在37个关键方面（包括感知准确性、语言清晰度和事实正确性）评估性能。

Result: 评估了18个VLM模型，发现即使最强模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%成功率。提供完整对话上下文能显著提升较小或较弱模型的性能，强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLM多轮交互能力的理想基准测试，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话方面的局限性，并强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用检索增强生成方法，通过图数据库和Cypher查询语言接口让LLM能够有效处理大型3D场景图，解决自然语言与机器人世界表示之间的连接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要一种更有效的方法来连接自然语言与机器人的世界表示。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估显示，使用Cypher接口的方法在大型丰富图上显著优于基线方法，性能大幅提升，同时大幅减少了场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher作为3D场景图的接口方法在本地和云端模型上都能显著扩展到大型丰富图，在语言接地任务中带来巨大性能改进。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可转移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定且微弱的噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，为模型鲁棒性评估建立高标准基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的微弱噪声模式(UTAP)，将其添加到病理图像中，系统性地破坏基础模型的特征表示能力。

Result: UTAP在多个最先进的病理学基础模型上进行了系统评估，使用固定噪声模式对输入图像进行视觉不可察觉的修改，导致模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，其开发为模型鲁棒性评估建立了关键的高标准基准，强调了推进防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Result: 在所有指标上达到SOTA性能，准确率提升18%，在不同通道深度下推理时间均优于当前SOTA模型。

Conclusion: HYDRA方法有效解决了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，实现了高质量的光谱重建。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在空间推理中的两个瓶颈：基于2D预训练导致的3D理解能力不足，以及冗余3D信息引发的推理失败。

Method: 双代理框架：感知代理使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息，包括新颖的SOG模块；推理代理迭代精炼信息追求最小化，在闭环中修剪冗余并请求缺失信息直到获得最小充分集。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著提高准确性并达到最先进性能，同时产生可解释的推理路径。

Conclusion: 通过明确追求充分性和最小化，MSSR框架有效解决了VLMs的空间推理挑战，并为未来模型提供了高质量训练数据源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Motivation: OCT图像分析对眼科疾病诊断至关重要，但获取配对的干净和噪声OCT图像数据集具有挑战性，因为存在固有散斑噪声和临床成像环境的实际限制。

Method: 提出SDPA++框架：通过自融合和自监督去噪生成伪真实图像，然后使用基于补丁的策略训练去噪模型集成，有效增强图像清晰度。

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实数据集上验证，使用CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标评估，显著提升了图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有真实噪声OCT图像而无干净参考的情况下，展示了改善临床实践中图像质量和诊断结果的潜力。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Motivation: 训练和测试样本之间的分布偏移经常发生，阻碍模型泛化性能。直接应用对比学习会损害性能，因为领域泛化设置中缺乏类内连接性。

Method: 提出DCCL范式：在数据侧使用更激进的数据增强和跨域正样本来提高类内连接性；在模型侧使用模型锚定来利用预训练表示中的类内连接性，并通过生成变换损失进行补充。

Result: 在五个标准领域泛化基准测试上的实验表明，DCCL即使没有领域监督也能优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨域概念连接性，成功解决了领域泛化中对比学习性能下降的问题，获得了可泛化的表示。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了通过一致性模型实现高效单步人体运动预测的可行性，为实时应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while

Motivation: 现有3D大语言模型在基于场景-对象的接地推理方面存在困难，缺乏类似人类的场景对象接地推理机制。

Method: 引入基于3D场景的接地思维链推理方法(SCENECOT)，将复杂推理任务分解为简单问题，基于多模态专家模块构建视觉线索，并开发了185K实例的大规模接地CoT推理数据集。

Result: 在多个复杂3D场景推理基准测试中表现优异，具有高度的接地问答一致性。

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR-WM是一个隐式残差世界模型，专注于建模当前状态和世界演化，通过预测残差变化而不是完整重建未来场景，提高了自动驾驶系统的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶系统中的视觉中心世界模型在完全重建未来场景时存在效率问题，大量计算资源被浪费在冗余建模静态背景上。

Method: IR-WM首先从视觉观察中建立鲁棒的鸟瞰图表示，然后利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为时间先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的残差变化，并通过对齐模块校准语义和动态错位。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面均取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过专注于建模世界变化而非完整重建，IR-WM显著提高了自动驾驶世界模型的效率和规划准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: 提出UKANFormer模型，在Allen Coral Atlas的噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁语义分割，通过架构设计缓解标签噪声问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁产品如Allen Coral Atlas在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在局限，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域

Method: 基于UKAN架构，在解码器中引入全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）模块，同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节

Result: 珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线模型

Conclusion: 架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展映射，为生态监测提供基础

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，束搜索能让2B参数的自回归模型在文本到图像生成任务中超越12B参数的扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在大型语言模型中取得了显著成功，但在图像生成领域的应用效果有限，特别是对连续扩散模型的搜索策略效果不佳。

Method: 采用束搜索策略应用于离散的自回归视觉模型，利用离散标记空间的特性进行早期剪枝和计算重用。

Result: 束搜索显著提升了文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型在多个基准测试中超越了12B参数的扩散模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而不仅仅是规模）对于视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型更适合搜索策略的应用。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SR模型容量的扩大，它们倾向于产生伪影，这些伪影的感知影响各不相同，应该根据其对人类观察者的显著程度来表征，而不是作为统一的二元缺陷处理。

Method: 构建了一个包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分，并基于该数据集训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够产生空间显著性热图。

Conclusion: 发布数据集和代码，以促进基于显著性的SR伪影评估和减轻。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Conclusion: WaMaIR框架通过结合大感受野特征提取、通道感知建模和纹理增强损失，显著提升了图像恢复中的纹理细节重建能力。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理图像区域时往往孤立考虑，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑结果不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失。

Method: 引入双级引导机制：区域在完整图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配。

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多级语义对齐，使每个区域理解其在全局图像上下文中的作用，实现精确协调的编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

Method: 将X射线图像分块、标记化，通过SSM-based视觉骨干网络提取特征，使用Partial LoRA获得最优性能，结合混合解码器的LLM生成医疗报告，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验充分验证了所提出策略对X射线医疗报告生成的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过参数高效微调预训练Mamba网络，在X射线医疗报告生成任务中表现出色，为医疗AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Motivation: 解决现有6D姿态估计方法在纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件下表现不佳的问题。

Method: 利用李代数扩展3DGS能力，构建姿态可微渲染管道，通过比较输入图像与渲染图像迭代优化姿态，同时更新3DGS模型中的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合光束法平差原理和3D高斯散射，有效提升了6D姿态估计在挑战性场景下的性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的零样本视频理解框架，通过结合预训练视觉语言模型的语义先验和经典机器学习算法，将视频理解重新定义为高维语义特征空间中的自监督时空聚类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据和任务特定训练，成本高且扩展性差。大型视觉语言模型在静态图像上的零样本推理能力尚未在视频领域充分发挥。

Method: 使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频流转换为语义特征轨迹，然后应用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流划分为离散的语义连贯事件片段，最后通过无监督密度聚类识别视频中的重复宏观场景和主题。

Result: 该方法能够自动生成结构化的多模态视频内容摘要，通过从每个发现的聚类中选择代表性关键帧并利用VLM的生成能力进行文本描述。

Conclusion: 该框架为零样本、自动化的视频内容结构分析提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的特定输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: 在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过精炼注意力图中嵌入的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点级特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相竞争或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效且强大的范式，为实现真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Motivation: 消除对昂贵人工标注数据集的依赖，实现可扩展的无监督道路分割，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Method: 首先基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线以上为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的IoU，表现出高精度和简单设计。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性在无监督道路分割中具有巨大潜力，为自动驾驶提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 摄影风格是知名摄影师魅力的体现，但现有方法要么无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，要么无法保持内容图像的内容完整性。

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，使用文本反转技术优化摄影概念的提示词，学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Result: PIF在提取和迁移各种摄影风格方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效学习摄影风格并保持内容完整性，在摄影风格迁移任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly
available for academic

TL;DR: ReefNet是一个大型公共珊瑚礁图像数据集，包含约925,000个属级硬珊瑚标注，映射到世界海洋物种名录，旨在推动自动珊瑚礁监测和领域泛化研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化等人类压力导致珊瑚礁快速衰退，迫切需要可扩展的自动监测方法。现有数据集在规模、地理范围或标注粒度上存在局限，且不适合机器学习。

Method: 收集来自76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标注。提出两种评估设置：源内基准和跨源基准，测试监督学习和零样本分类性能。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但跨域性能显著下降；零样本模型在所有情况下表现均较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属。

Conclusion: ReefNet提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类的进展，促进稳健、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测和保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决不同来源木屑数据分布变化问题，准确率提升23%达到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接方法（烘箱干燥）处理时间长且破坏样本，间接方法在不同来源木屑上准确性不足。需要一种能有效应对来源变异性的稳健方法。

Method: 综合分析五种纹理特征预测水分含量，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征在不同域间传递知识，并基于调整互信息提出模型保存标准。

Result: 组合五种纹理特征准确率达95%。AdaptMoist方法使跨域预测准确率从57%提升至80%，提高23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木屑水分含量估计的有效稳健解决方案，对依赖木屑的产业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2DGS-R是一种分层训练方法，通过引入正常一致性正则化和原地克隆操作，在保持几何精度的同时提升2D高斯溅射的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)难以准确表示表面，而2DGS虽然几何保真度有所提升，但渲染质量仍然受损。当前无法在单一训练阶段同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练方法：首先使用正常一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后冻结不透明度进行微调。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅需1%额外存储和最小额外训练时间，在保持精细几何结构的同时实现了高质量渲染结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器等分布式安全基础设施中的最优解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习具有区分性和空间一致性的表示。

Method: BARL框架包含两个协作分支，在标签空间采用双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正，在表示空间进行区域级和病灶实例级匹配。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。

Conclusion: 双边对齐框架能有效提升半监督医学图像分割性能，消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配准的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与基于内存库的异常检测相结合，解决现有方法在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些问题会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与异常检测目标集成。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习，获得对旋转鲁棒且对异常检测有效的特征。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 点云配准不仅在几何结构对齐中起关键作用，还能引导特征提取获得旋转不变和局部判别性表示。通过联合优化配准和异常检测，可以获得更鲁棒和有效的特征。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经元级别的分析框架，通过结合人工神经元分析和fMRI体素编码，研究视觉语言模型与人脑多模态信息处理机制的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人脑处理机制的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽略了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码，对CLIP和METER两种架构不同的视觉语言模型进行神经元级别的分析。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：(1)人工神经元能成功预测多个功能网络中生物神经元的活动；(2)人工和生物神经元都表现出功能冗余；(3)人工神经元表现出与生物神经元相似的极性模式；(4)不同架构驱动不同的生物神经元激活模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型在神经元级别上存在类似大脑的层次处理提供了有力证据。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Conclusion: Edit-R1框架有效解决了指令式图像编辑中的过拟合问题，通过策略优化和MLLM奖励模型实现了优异的泛化能力和性能提升，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance

task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但计算昂贵，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一理论基础

Method: 将扩散蒸馏表述为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文生图任务上，相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的一步FID，保持高视觉保真度

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是实现高效一步扩散生成的理论基础扎实的实用途径

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Motivation: 传统视频步骤定位方法需要带标注的训练集且需离线处理整个视频，成本高且无法满足在线决策需求。本文旨在探索无需训练、在线运行的解决方案。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型预测有限帧中的步骤，并开发BaGLM方法，通过贝叶斯滤波整合历史帧信息，利用大型语言模型提取的依赖矩阵和步骤进度估计来建模步骤转换。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，BaGLM在无需任务特定调优的情况下，优于基于训练的离线模型，且在线策略超越了离线训练模型。

Conclusion: BaGLM展示了利用大型多模态模型进行在线视频步骤定位的有效性，无需训练即可超越现有最先进的基于训练的方法。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Motivation: 当前时序视频定位研究主要集中于少数几种视频表示方法，可能导致长期的架构过拟合问题。

Method: 在三个基准数据集(Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions、YouCookII)上，使用基于CNN、时序推理和transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构上评估其影响。

Conclusion: 不同视频特征之间存在潜在互补性，这为改进时序视频定位任务提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态大语言模型联合处理文本和视频，解决视频时序定位中查询信息不足和幻觉问题，提升定位精度。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法有效利用多模态LLM能力，通过查询增强和动态选择策略，在视频时序定位任务中实现了卓越性能，特别是在零样本场景下表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下提升3D定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，忽视了3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征作为"What"识别的语义信标，3D特征作为"Where"定位的空间锚点，采用双目标损失函数：对齐损失通过适应交叉熵监督融合预测，伪标签损失通过边界机制惩罚过度有效的2D主导伪输出。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制，有效解决了多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，实现了更精确的3D定位。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个临床医生参与的深度学习管道，用于肺癌CT图像分割和预后预测。VNet模型在分割性能、放射组学稳定性和预测准确性方面表现最佳，半监督学习优于监督学习，且获得放射科医生的临床信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，而深度学习虽然提供自动化，但在临床应用中面临障碍。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，评估了5种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D）。通过497个放射组学特征评估分割可重复性，比较监督学习和半监督学习的预后建模，并由6名医生进行定性评估。

Result: VNet达到最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71），放射组学稳定性最高（平均相关性=0.76，ICC=0.65），在半监督学习下预测准确性最佳（准确率=0.88，F1=0.83）。半监督学习在所有模型中均优于监督学习。放射科医生偏好VNet的瘤周表征和更平滑的边界。

Conclusion: 将VNet与半监督学习结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的CT肺癌预后预测，为以医生为中心的AI转化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

*Zhe Luo,Wenjing Jia,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProDAT方法，通过密度感知的尾丢弃机制实现点云的渐进式编码，在单一模型中支持多比特率解码，显著提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了在资源受限环境中的高质量服务部署。现有的学习型点云几何编码方法虽然成功，但固定潜在表示不支持渐进式解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，ProDAT不仅实现了渐进式编码，而且在编码效率上优于最先进的学习型编码技术，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT成功解决了点云渐进式编码的问题，通过密度感知机制实现了高效的渐进解码，为资源受限环境下的点云应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FMCAF预处理架构，通过频域滤波和跨注意力融合来增强RGB和红外图像的多模态目标检测性能，在多个数据集上表现优于传统融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多种传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性，但需要更好的融合方法来提升性能。

Method: FMCAF结合频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)来抑制冗余频谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)来改进模态间特征共享。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法，在VEDAI上mAP@50提升13.9%，在LLVIP上提升1.1%。

Conclusion: FMCAF作为一个灵活的预处理架构，有潜力成为未来多模态检测流程中鲁棒融合的基础方法。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建质量，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑、精确的网格表示，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时难以保证足够的平滑性和精度，而平面是3D场景中的重要元素，特别是在人造环境中。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应重新分类高梯度平面高斯；利用优化后的平面先验优化网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面片数量，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 平面先验的引入有效提升了高斯泼溅在平面区域的重建质量，支持场景编辑和物理仿真等下游应用。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对预训练扩散模型的优化策略，通过潜在空间精炼和双向交互机制，在保持感知真实性的同时显著提升内容保真度，特别是在低光场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实性，这一问题在低光场景中尤为严重。

Method: 引入潜在精炼管道来恢复VAE编码过程中丢失的空间细节，并建立条件潜在与噪声潜在之间的动态双向交互机制。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著提升了预训练扩散模型的保真度性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的优化策略能够无缝集成到现有扩散网络中，提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学质量的同时改善保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LED环境照明为消费相机生成视觉不可见水印的方法，通过优化LED光源的光谱特性，使其对人眼几乎不可见但对相机高度可检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种在消费相机拍摄的视频中嵌入水印的技术，支持隐私保护和内容验证，同时确保水印对人眼不可见。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，联合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱敏感性和LED产生白光的特性，优化LED光谱轮廓。

Result: 能够在标准帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，在10秒视频片段中嵌入128位信息，足以支持基本元数据需求。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对人眼不可见但对相机可检测的水印嵌入，为隐私保护和内容验证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

TL;DR: 提出了GOOD框架，通过双重引导机制生成OOD样本，提升OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定和偏移多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: GOOD框架使用现成的ID分类器直接引导扩散采样轨迹：1）图像级引导基于对数分割梯度降低输入似然；2）特征级引导基于k-NN距离在分类器潜在空间中促进稀疏区域采样

Result: GOOD生成的样本能够显著提升OOD检测性能，通过定量和定性分析验证了其有效性

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制实现了更可控和多样化的OOD样本生成，提出的统一OOD评分增强了检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineDiff3D是一个统一的框架，用于从单视图输入重建多样化的铰接物体实例和进行姿态估计，通过结合运动学感知的VAE编码和条件扩散模型来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接物体（如笔记本电脑和抽屉）由于多部件几何结构和可变关节配置，在3D重建和姿态估计方面面临挑战，这些结构多样性在不同状态下引入复杂性。

Method: 首先通过运动学感知VAE将完整几何、关节角度和部件分割编码到结构化潜在空间；然后使用两个条件扩散模型：一个用于回归全局姿态和关节参数，另一个用于从部分观测生成运动学感知潜在代码；最后通过迭代优化模块双向优化重建精度和运动学参数。

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架有效解决了铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，通过运动学感知的扩散模型实现了准确的重建和参数估计。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

TL;DR: GACO-CAD是一个两阶段后训练框架，通过深度和法线图作为几何先验，结合强化学习的组长度奖励，从单张图像生成可编辑的CAD模型，在几何精度和建模简洁性上达到SOTA性能。

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在从2D图像推断3D几何方面存在空间推理能力有限的问题，导致生成的CAD模型几何精度不足。

Method: 两阶段框架：监督微调阶段使用深度和法线图作为多通道输入的几何先验；强化学习阶段引入组长度奖励来鼓励简洁的建模序列，采用动态加权策略稳定训练。

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上，GACO-CAD在相同MLLM骨干网络下达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过几何先验和简洁建模奖励的联合优化，有效提升了从单张图像生成可编辑CAD模型的几何准确性和建模效率。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Method: 评估多种现成的最先进对抗攻击在不同预处理技术下的可迁移性，包括人脸检测模型和降采样插值方法，并提出基于输入变换的预处理不变方法。

Result: 人脸检测模型选择显著影响攻击成功率（最多降低78%），而插值方法影响较小。预处理需求甚至在白盒设置中也会降低攻击强度。提出的预处理不变方法可将攻击可迁移性提升27%。

Conclusion: 预处理在人脸识别系统中至关重要，考虑预处理因素有助于提高面部对抗样本的对抗泛化能力。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

TL;DR: GtR是一种无需训练的分层采样策略，通过将图像生成分解为结构生成和细节重建两个阶段，在保持生成质量的同时实现3.72倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAR模型在并行生成视觉token时，由于空间相关性建模复杂而导致的加速潜力受限问题。

Method: 提出GtR策略：第一阶段缓慢生成全局语义结构，第二阶段快速重建剩余细节token。同时使用FTS方法基于高频信息能量分配计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务中，MAR-H模型实现3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量（FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs 原模型1.59, 299.1）。

Conclusion: GtR方法在各种模型规模和生成任务中显著优于现有加速方法，有效平衡了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIDISC是一个双曲表示学习框架，用于领域泛化的广义类别发现（DG-GCD），通过GPT引导的扩散增强和切线空间插值实现领域和类别级别的泛化，无需模拟训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练时同时访问标记和未标记数据且来自同一领域，限制了在涉及分布偏移的开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见领域，而无需在训练期间访问目标领域数据。

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行源域增强；引入切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值；结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应离群排斥的统一损失；可学习的曲率参数适应数据集复杂性。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习有效解决了DG-GCD问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，为开放世界场景中的类别发现提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉token冗余导致推理成本过高，现有方法忽视文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性

Method: 分层方法：先选择任务相关的核心视觉token集合，再补充多样性token以保留更广泛上下文

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，即使剪枝90%的token，性能也能达到或超越最先进方法，仅造成最小精度损失，同时显著减少GPU内存占用和推理延迟

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉token剪枝方法在保持性能的同时有效降低了推理成本

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

*M Saifuzzaman Rafat,Mohd Ruhul Ameen,Akif Islam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用Segment Anything Model (SAM)开发了一个专门用于监测孟加拉国河流侵蚀的AI模型，通过历史Google Earth图像创建了首个包含消失定居点标注的数据集，实现了86.30%的IoU和92.60%的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国河流每年吞噬村庄和农田，造成大规模社区消失和人口流离失所，但传统的人工监测方法难以有效跟踪这一缓慢的灾难过程。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器以识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。

Result: 模型在河流侵蚀识别方面表现出色，平均IoU达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了三个关键贡献：首个孟加拉国河流侵蚀导致定居点消失的标注数据集、专门针对此任务的微调AI模型，以及通过视觉证据量化土地损失的方法，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了强大的监测工具。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

TL;DR: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，通过分析VALORANT游戏小地图中的战术特征（角色位置和游戏事件）来预测回合结果，在增强战术事件标签的数据集上达到约81%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志数据和统计信息，本研究针对需要复杂策略的FPS游戏VALORANT，旨在通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息来构建回合结果预测模型。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细的战术特征（如角色位置信息和其他游戏内事件），并构建增强战术事件标签的数据集进行训练。

Result: 在增强战术事件标签的数据集上训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，尤其是在回合中后期阶段。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过分布对齐重放、先验正则化类别平衡损失和全连接梯度校准三个组件，有效缓解灾难性遗忘和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学知识的性能。现有重放式类增量学习方法由于内窥镜图像严重的域差异和类别不平衡问题，难以有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的广泛实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的类增量学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在终身内窥镜诊断中有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统易受欺骗攻击，攻击者可能使用注册用户的照片绕过认证，需要在人脸识别前检测此类欺骗攻击

Method: 使用带寄存器的DINOv2提取可泛化特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，专注于关键细微特征

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届人脸反欺骗研讨会提供的统一物理-数字攻击检测数据集和SiW数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的基于DINOv2的欺骗攻击检测方法能够有效区分真实人脸和欺骗图像

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VisiPruner，一种无需训练的剪枝框架，通过分析MLLMs的三阶段跨模态交互过程，显著减少视觉相关注意力计算和FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致计算开销巨大。现有剪枝方法缺乏对MLLMs处理多模态信息机制的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现MLLMs存在三阶段跨模态交互过程，基于此提出VisiPruner框架，在浅层识别任务意图，中层进行跨模态融合，深层专注于语言精炼，从而有效剪枝视觉token。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少了99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，并在多种MLLMs上具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了高效的剪枝方案，还为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作的指导原则，即模型架构应与内在的层级处理动态对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多时刻检索数据集QV-M²和新方法FlashMMR，解决了现有单时刻检索方法在真实应用中的不足，通过后验证模块优化时刻边界，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法主要关注单时刻检索，但真实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，这使得现有数据集和方法不足以满足视频时序定位的实际需求。

Method: 提出FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块，通过约束性时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过精密的过滤流程修剪低置信度提议，实现鲁棒的多时刻对齐。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP上提升3.00%，在mAP@3+tgt上提升2.70%，在mR@3上提升2.56%。

Conclusion: QV-M²数据集和FlashMMR方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位场景研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效提升了深度伪造检测的公平性和可解释性，同时保持了高检测性能。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在标准条件下表现可靠，但难以经济高效地泛化到多样化现实场景。自然语言能更有效地描述和处理复杂场景

Method: 设计提示从MLLMs提取结构化场景理解，将其蒸馏为可学习嵌入来增强现有行为预测模型，利用MLLMs的零样本推理能力

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上验证，两个最先进的运动预测模型都获得了一致的性能提升

Conclusion: PnF方法通过MLLMs的零样本能力有效提升了运动预测性能，无需微调，具有实用价值

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文发现自监督学习中存在一个反直觉现象：训练时间过长会损害密集预测任务的性能，称为自监督密集退化(SDD)。作者提出了DSE指标来评估无标注情况下的密集表示质量，并基于此开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中训练时间过长反而会损害密集预测任务性能的反常现象，需要解决无标注情况下评估密集表示质量的挑战。

Method: 提出了Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE)，包含类别相关性度量和有效维度度量，用于评估密集表示质量。基于DSE开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。

Result: 在16种SSL方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择策略平均提升mIoU 3.0%，计算成本可忽略；DSE正则化能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: DSE指标能有效评估自监督学习中的密集表示质量，提出的模型选择和正则化方法能显著改善密集预测任务的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized

face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

### [133] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过两阶段方法解决BOLD信号失真和计算复杂性问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的两个基本限制：从血氧动力学失真的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD反卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上的受试者中无法识别这些标准回路；工作记忆数据的网络分析揭示了大脑根据刺激策略性地转移其主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了一个实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，能够捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

*Wei Zhang,Zhanhao Hu,Xiao Li,Xiaopei Zhu,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗性防御方法对大型对抗性衣物攻击的防御效果，发现这些防御方法在面对覆盖人体大面积区域的对抗性衣物时表现不佳，揭示了现有防御系统的共同漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验发现简单增大对抗性补丁的尺寸就能使现有防御方法失效，因此需要评估防御方法对具有大面积覆盖的对抗性衣物的防御能力，这类攻击不仅尺寸大而且比人体上的大补丁看起来更自然。

Method: 通过制作对抗性衣物来测试各种防御方法，在数字世界和物理世界中进行实验评估，并制作了能够同时突破多种防御方法的单一衣物攻击。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗性衣物攻击下表现都很差，制作的单一对抗性衣物在物理世界中对抗未防御检测器的攻击成功率达到96.06%，对抗九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗性防御方法在面对对抗性衣物这种大型攻击时存在共同漏洞，需要开发更有效的防御策略来应对这类物理世界中的对抗性攻击。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

*Gyuhwan Park,Kihyun Na,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，通过字符级引导的扩散模型有效恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对LPR系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，促进车牌图像的进一步利用。

Method: 使用基于扩散的框架，结合字符级先验知识，通过外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符信息，并引入CHARM模块确保每个字符的引导仅限其自身区域。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，相比最佳基线模型，CER相对降低28%，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI基本操作与高级编程工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖基本操作（点击、输入、滚动），需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联故障和性能瓶颈，而其他代理可以利用丰富的编程接口。

Method: 包含四个关键组件：自动化工具扩展管道、合成数据引擎、大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集、结合监督微调和在线强化学习的两阶段训练管道。

Result: 在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型平均相对改进22%，步骤减少11%；在WindowsAgentArena上达到21.7%的成功率，优于基于Windows数据训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制至关重要，能减少错误传播同时保持执行效率，为计算机使用代理提供了更强大的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理的开放集识别方法，通过测量模型特征与预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设定下训练，当遇到未知类别时会过度自信。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于输入到最近类均值的距离构建概率分布，然后将NCM分布与softmax概率进行比较，测量NCM和分类头之间的一致性。

Result: 在两个数据集上均排名前三，表现稳定。在非洲和瑞典动物数据集上分别达到93.41和95.35的AUROC。

Conclusion: 提出的后处理OSR方法无需重新训练模型，在两个数据集上表现一致且优秀，优于仅在单个数据集上表现好的现有方法。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍文本压缩，在保持准确性的同时显著提升处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理百万级token长上下文时面临的计算和内存成本过高的问题。

Method: 将长文本渲染为图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，并通过LLM驱动的遗传搜索优化视觉渲染配置。

Result: 实现3-4倍token压缩，预填充和解码速度提升约4倍，SFT训练速度提升约2倍，128K上下文VLM可处理1M token任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文缩放是解决长上下文建模挑战的有效方法，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将SAM模型的视觉语义知识迁移到事件编码器中，显著提升事件到视频重建的语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机仅捕获强度变化，忽略静态物体和背景，导致事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有E2V方法往往忽视语义信息在视频重建中的重要作用。

Method: 1. 跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM的视觉语义知识迁移到事件编码器；2. 语义感知特征融合块整合学习到的语义特征；3. 语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签帮助重建语义细节。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: Semantic-E2VID通过引入视觉语义知识有效解决了事件模态缺乏语义信息的问题，显著改善了事件到视频的重建质量。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: M2H作为单目空间感知系统的基础，支持动态环境中的3D场景图构建，在真实世界数据验证中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Result: 在流媒体视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在效率和效果之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法兼容标准Video-LLMs，无需额外训练，有效解决了流媒体视频处理的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 合成人脸数据是面部识别研究科学可行且符合伦理要求的替代方案，能够有效解决隐私保护和法律合规问题。

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情易导致误诊，且忽略不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，大多仅进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为PD严重程度诊断提供了有效的解决方案，多表情特征融合和类别平衡策略显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

TL;DR: LoopTrans是一个闭环框架，通过双向知识转移在自我中心和外中心视角间传递交互知识，解决了传统单向转移的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统弱监督可操作性定位方法仅从外中心图像单向提取知识到自我中心图像，在复杂交互场景中适用性有限。人类能够通过观察他人与物体的交互来学习新物体的使用方式，这启发了双向知识转移的需求。

Method: 提出LoopTrans闭环框架，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，实现自我中心和外中心视角间的双向知识转移，弥合领域差距。

Conclusion: 双向闭环知识转移框架比传统单向方法更有效，能够更好地模拟人类观察学习过程，在复杂交互场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human

### [146] [Monitoring Horses in Stalls: From Object to Event Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17409)
*Dmitrii Galimzianov,Viacheslav Vyshegorodtsev,Ivan Nezhivykh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于视觉的马厩监控系统，使用YOLOv11和BoT-SORT自动检测和跟踪马匹与人员，通过物体轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统马匹行为监测方法劳动密集且耗时，需要自动化系统来早期发现健康福利问题。

Method: 使用YOLOv11进行目标检测，BoT-SORT进行多目标跟踪，基于CLIP和GroundingDINO构建自定义数据集，通过物体轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态。

Result: 系统能区分五种事件类型并考虑相机盲区，对马相关事件表现可靠，但人员检测因数据稀缺存在局限性。

Conclusion: 为马场实时行为监测提供了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepDetect是一个智能、一体化的密集关键点检测器，通过融合传统检测器的优势，使用深度学习技术解决了现有方法在光照变化敏感性、关键点密度和可重复性等方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（如SIFT、SURF、ORB等）和学习方法（如SuperPoint、R2D2等）存在对光照变化敏感、关键点密度低、可重复性差、对挑战性场景适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题，无法优先关注视觉重要区域。

Method: 首先融合7个关键点检测器和2个边缘检测器的输出创建真实标签掩码，提取从角点、斑点到显著边缘和纹理的多样化视觉线索。然后使用轻量高效的ESPNet模型，以这些掩码作为标签进行训练。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上的评估显示，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、可重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数（59,003）方面均优于其他检测器，达到最大值。

Conclusion: DeepDetect能够语义化地关注图像，产生高度密集的关键点，并能适应多样化和视觉退化条件，在关键点检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

TL;DR: 利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应关系和经过余弦一致性过滤的短轨迹，在压缩域前端实现与SIFT相当的性能但CPU使用更少，在SfM演示中成功重建大量点云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索压缩域对应关系作为资源高效的前端解决方案，为完整流程提供可扩展路径。

Method: 重新利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应，通过余弦一致性过滤短轨迹，在压缩域进行处理。

Result: 在117帧视频上成功注册所有图像，重建46-62万点云，重投影误差0.51-0.53像素，匹配密度影响BA时间。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是实用且资源高效的前端方案，具有明确的扩展路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出HQ-NightRain高质量夜间去雨数据集和CST-Net网络，通过可学习色彩空间转换和隐式光照指导来改进夜间图像去雨效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨面临复杂场景挑战，缺乏高质量数据集准确表征雨和光照的耦合效应。

Method: 开发CST-Net网络，包含可学习色彩空间转换器在Y通道更好去除雨迹，引入隐式光照指导提高模型在复杂场景中的鲁棒性。

Result: 广泛实验验证了数据集的价值和方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法为夜间图像去雨任务提供了更好的基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯溅射初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来解决稀疏视图下的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯溅射容易过拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法通过改进初始化或添加训练时约束来解决，但研究发现初始化是决定性因素。

Method: 1) 频率感知SfM：通过低频视图增强和宽松的多视图对应关系改进低纹理区域覆盖；2) 3DGS自初始化：将光度监督提升为附加点，用学习的高斯中心补偿SfM稀疏区域；3) 点云正则化：通过简单几何/可见性先验强制多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升，成为更强的初始化策略。

Conclusion: 初始化是稀疏视图3D高斯溅射的关键因素，提出的综合初始化方法能有效解决过拟合问题并提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at
https://github.com/zss171999645/ItG-GS.

Motivation: 现有的占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知的灵活性，其"原地分类"方法可能与真实场景的动态连续性存在错位。

Method: 提出了范围自适应感知模块，通过可学习查询结合车辆状态调制和时空关联实现扩展范围感知；设计了状态条件预测模块，用回归引导的预测替代基于分类的预测；开发了时间感知自调度训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务上实现了最先进的性能，验证了SparseWorld在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询和创新的模块设计，成功解决了现有占用世界模型的局限性，为4D环境建模提供了更灵活、自适应和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

*Muhammad Umer Ramzan,Ali Zia,Abdelwahed Khamis,Noman Ali,Usman Ali,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSOD是一个无需像素级标签的端到端无监督显著目标检测方法，通过POTNet生成高质量伪掩码来监督标准编码器-解码器，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有无监督和弱监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测(SOD)作为计算机视觉基础任务，作者认为无需像素级标签也能达到接近监督方法的精度，但前提是获得可靠的伪掩码。现有原型方法存在边界和内部像素几何特性不同、最优传输全局一致性利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出POTNet，改进原型最优传输方法：使用熵引导的双聚类头，高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means，然后通过最优传输对齐两个原型集。这种分割-融合-传输设计在单次前向传播中生成更清晰、部分感知的伪掩码。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，AutoSOD在F-measure指标上比无监督方法提升高达26%，比弱监督方法提升高达36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: AutoSOD通过POTNet生成高质量伪掩码，构建了端到端的无监督SOD流程，在消除SelfMask离线投票的同时提高了准确性和训练效率，证明了无监督SOD可以达到接近监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，构建结构化、数据集自适应的评分标准来指导可解释的场景评估，实现无需参数调优的零样本视频摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高层次语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工设计的提示模板和数据集特定分数归一化高度敏感。

Method: 使用评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，构建结构化评分标准。推理时首尾片段仅基于描述评分，中间片段结合相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和先前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签方法有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习分割模型在纵向主动监测分析中的局限性，这些模型通常基于单时间点和专家标注数据训练，无法有效处理多时间点和专家标注稀缺的问题。

Method: 采用Mamba增强的交叉注意力模块捕获时间演化和长距离空间依赖，形状提取器模块编码先前分割掩码为潜在解剖表示，结合半监督自训练策略利用预训练nnU-Net生成的伪标签。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为前列腺癌主动监测提供了一种有效的纵向分割解决方案，能够在专家标注稀缺的情况下实现准确的分割性能。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 为了减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，开发一种仅需图像级标签的弱监督道路裂缝检测方法，以支持智能城市基础设施维护。

Method: 提出WP-CrackNet框架，包含三个组件：生成类激活图的分类器、测量特征可推断性的重构器、生成像素级检测结果的检测器。通过对抗学习和伪标签训练，结合路径感知注意力模块和中心增强CAM一致性模块优化检测效果。

Conclusion: WP-CrackNet通过弱监督学习有效解决了道路裂缝检测问题，减少了标注成本，为智能基础设施维护提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

TL;DR: PAGE-4D是一个扩展VGGT到动态场景的前馈模型，能够同时进行相机位姿估计、深度预测和点云重建，无需后处理。通过动态感知聚合器解决静态与动态信息之间的任务冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D前馈模型在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含复杂动态元素（如移动人物、可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息：抑制运动线索用于位姿估计，增强运动线索用于几何重建。

Result: 在动态场景中持续优于原始VGGT，在相机位姿估计、单目和视频深度估计、密集点图重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了多任务4D重建中的任务冲突问题，在动态场景下表现出色，为动态场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeCraft是一个多智能体框架，通过图形化程序形状表示将自然语言转换为结构化、可交互的3D资产，解决了现有方法生成非结构化网格和交互性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成方法通常产生非结构化网格且交互性差，难以满足艺术工作流程的需求，需要一种能够生成结构化、可交互3D资产的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于图形的程序形状表示，将复杂自然语言分解为子任务图，使用LLM智能体分层解析用户输入并迭代优化程序建模和绘制过程。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，ShapeCraft在生成几何准确和语义丰富的3D资产方面优于现有的基于LLM的方法，并展示了动画和用户自定义编辑的潜力。

Conclusion: ShapeCraft通过结构化图形表示和多智能体框架，成功实现了从自然语言生成高质量、可交互3D资产的目标，具有广泛的交互应用前景。

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的3D点云自动分割框架，结合无人机扫描的真实点云和BIM生成的合成数据，解决基础设施组件分割中手动标注耗时且易出错的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机技术结合摄影测量能够高效进行非接触式结构健康监测，但传统方法依赖耗时且易出错的手动标注来分割特定结构组件。

Method: 使用机器学习框架，结合真实无人机扫描点云和BIM生成的合成数据，克服手动标注的限制。

Result: 在铁路轨道数据集上的验证显示，该方法能高精度识别和分割主要组件（如铁轨和枕木），使用小规模数据集结合BIM数据显著减少训练时间同时保持合理分割精度。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法提高了3D基础设施模型分割的精度和效率，推动了无人机和BIM技术在结构健康监测和基础设施管理中的集成。

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是首个用于全谱图像无监督异常检测的统一框架，通过五个简单元素的协同工作，在多类检测中弥合性能差距，并扩展到多种数据模态和任务设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多类异常检测模型性能显著落后于单类模型，且该领域已分裂为针对特定场景的专门方法，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 基于"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，实现方法极简主义，无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个UAD基准测试中，Dinomaly2在多种模态、任务设置和应用领域均表现出全谱优势。多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的图像级AUROC。

Conclusion: Dinomaly2通过极简设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性，成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

TL;DR: CaMiT数据集捕捉汽车模型的时间演化，支持监督和自监督学习。静态预训练在域内数据上表现良好但跨年测试准确率下降。提出时间增量分类设置和两种策略来提升时间鲁棒性，并探索时间感知图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在对象外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术产品的代表类别，其时间演化需要被研究。

Method: 引入CaMiT数据集，包含787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本。提出时间增量分类设置，评估时间增量预训练和时间增量分类器学习两种策略。探索时间感知图像生成方法。

Result: 静态预训练在域内数据上达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但跨年测试准确率下降。时间增量策略改善了时间鲁棒性。时间感知图像生成产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应提供了丰富的基准，时间增量学习策略能有效提升模型的时间鲁棒性。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DINO-CV分割框架，使用高分辨率机载LiDAR衍生的数字高程模型（DEMs）自动映射低矮干石墙，解决了植被遮挡和标记数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要的遗产和环境价值，但由于难以接近和手动测绘成本高，许多墙体未被识别。深度学习分割提供了可扩展的解决方案，但面临视觉遮挡和标记数据有限的挑战。

Method: DINO-CV采用自监督跨视图预训练策略，基于知识蒸馏学习跨多个DEM衍生物的视觉和几何表示，支持ResNet、Wide ResNet和Vision Transformers等多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在维多利亚州Budj Bim联合国教科文组织世界遗产文化景观中应用，该方法识别了澳大利亚最密集的殖民时期干石墙集合之一。DINO-CV在测试区域实现了68.6%的平均交并比（mIoU），仅使用10%标记数据微调时仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在高分辨率DEM衍生物上进行自监督学习，在植被茂密且注释稀缺的遗产丰富环境中实现自动干石墙映射具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭的联邦学习方法用于暴力检测：零样本和联邦微调的视觉语言模型(VLMs)与个性化训练的紧凑3D卷积神经网络(CNN3D)。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面更优。提出了混合模型方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭的联邦学习方法进行暴力检测，特别关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供可复现基线。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数的CNN3D作为代表性案例，在非IID设置下评估准确率、校准和能耗。比较零样本和联邦微调的VLMs与个性化训练的CNN3D两种策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于低秩适应(LoRA)微调的VLMs，且能耗更低。VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。量化了训练和推理过程中的能耗与CO2排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM用于复杂或描述性场景。该框架为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供了可复现基线，可扩展到实时、多模态和生命周期感知系统。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

TL;DR: 提出了4DSegStreamer框架，使用双线程系统处理流式4D全景分割，能够在受限时间预算内实现实时细粒度感知，特别适用于高动态环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高度动态环境（如密集人群疏散、复杂场景自动驾驶）中需要实时、细粒度感知的问题，现有方法在高FPS条件下鲁棒性不足。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新记忆并补偿自运动和动态物体移动来确保及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在复杂场景中能准确预测动态物体，特别在高FPS条件下表现出优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用框架，可无缝集成到现有3D和4D分割方法中实现实时能力，在动态环境感知方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽略了编辑操作带来的物理效应（如阴影、反射、物体交互等），这些对生成真实感至关重要。

Method: 1) 构建PICABench基准，涵盖8个物理子维度（光学、力学、状态转换等）和常见编辑操作；2) 提出PICAEval评估协议，使用VLM作为评判器，结合区域级人工标注；3) 从视频中学习物理知识，构建PICA-100K训练数据集。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现，物理真实性仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 物理真实感是图像编辑的重要方向，提出的基准和解决方案可为从简单内容编辑向物理一致性真实感发展的未来工作奠定基础。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Conclusion: IC-MoE在保持预训练权重结构完整性的同时，显著增强了高层特征表示能力，并在多样化医学图像分割场景中展现出优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本到图像行人检索的挑战，实现了跨语言和跨模态的更好对齐

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Conclusion: OP3Det通过利用2D基础模型的强泛化能力和零样本能力，结合跨模态特征学习，成功实现了开放世界的3D物体检测，为广义3D物体发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Conclusion: GAS方法通过简单参数化和对抗训练的结合，有效解决了扩散模型采样效率问题，同时保持了高质量的细节生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Method: 结合梯度信息与跨网络结构相关性，通过进化算法近似Hessian非对角结构，使用自监督重要性评分机制，无需分类头即可通用。

Result: 在DINO、SigLIPv2、DeIT和AugReg模型上的实验表明，在各种稀疏度下均优于现有方法，单A100 GPU上5分钟内生成弹性模型。

Conclusion: SnapViT提供了一种高效、无需重训练的视觉Transformer剪枝策略，实现了计算预算的弹性适应，显著提升了部署灵活性。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or
labels. Code and pruned models are available at: https://elastic.ashita.nl/

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动分析循环血细胞簇图像的计算框架，通过YOLOv11模型分类细胞簇，并结合多通道荧光染色识别细胞类型，准确率超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动分析血细胞簇图像的工具，而细胞簇具有不规则形状和异质性细胞组成，需要多通道染色来识别具体细胞类型。

Method: 采用两步分析策略：首先使用YOLOv11模型对图像进行细胞簇分类，然后通过叠加簇轮廓与多通道荧光染色区域来识别细胞类型。

Result: 在细胞簇分类和表型识别方面均达到超过95%的准确率，优于传统CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架能有效分析流式细胞术中的CCC图像，具有扩展到免疫细胞和肿瘤细胞簇分析的潜力。

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射在真实雨滴条件下因镜头污染导致的严重遮挡和光学畸变问题，现有基准仅使用合成雨滴图像且假设理想条件，无法反映真实场景中相机姿态估计和点云初始化的挑战。

Method: 构建包含三个对齐图像集（雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦、无雨地面实况）的真实世界雨滴重建数据集，设计完整评估流程：数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知3DGS评估，涵盖相机姿态估计、点云初始化、单图像去雨和3D高斯训练比较。

Result: 通过全面实验揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及不同流程组件的影响：相机焦点位置对重建性能的影响，不准确的姿态和点云初始化对重建的干扰。

Conclusion: 为开发更鲁棒的雨滴条件下3DGS方法提供了明确方向，建立了首个评估完整3DGS流程在真实雨滴条件下性能的基准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Motivation: 解决离线签名验证中由于笔迹风格和采集协议差异导致的跨数据集泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 使用CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic三个公共基准数据集，开发了基于原始签名图像和壳预处理两种实验流程。

Result: 原始图像模型在跨基准测试中表现更好，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进的潜力。

Conclusion: 虽然两种方法各有优势，但原始图像方法在当前表现更佳，壳预处理方法为未来开发鲁棒的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多参考视觉位置识别中，虽然使用不同条件下的参考集能提升定位性能，但增加数据多样性和模型复杂度会带来高昂计算成本的问题。现有描述符级融合方法依赖启发式规则，在视角和外观变化下收益有限。

Method: 采用无需训练的描述符无关方法，通过矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，实现基于投影的残差匹配。同时提出了SotonMV结构化多视角VPR基准。

Result: 在多外观数据上，该方法比单参考方法Recall@1提升约18%，在视角和外观变化下均优于多参考基线方法，在非结构化数据上也有约5%的提升，表现出强大的泛化能力且保持轻量化。

Conclusion: 该方法在多参考视觉位置识别中实现了显著性能提升，具有强大的泛化能力和轻量化优势，无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

TL;DR: 提出基于双编码器和注意力机制的方法，结合病灶分割和临床元数据，提高皮肤癌分类的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在黑盒问题，缺乏临床信任。病灶的高类内变异性和细微类间差异也增加了自动诊断的难度。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割；分类阶段采用两个DenseNet201编码器分别处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征；加入基于transformer的模块整合患者元数据。

Result: 在HAM10000、ISIC 2018和2019数据集上达到最先进的分割性能，显著提升分类准确率和平均AUC；Grad-CAM热图验证模型关注病灶区域而非背景特征。

Conclusion: 结合精确病灶分割、临床数据和注意力融合的方法能够构建更准确、可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉标记，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关标记，实现端到端2.6倍加速，同时保持甚至提升多模态任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的推理可扩展性受到视觉标记数量增长的制约，这些标记主导了推理延迟。现有方法难以在保持多轮对话保真度的同时实现高效推理。

Method: 提出解耦视觉稀疏性方法：预填充阶段进行查询无关的剪枝，解码阶段进行查询感知的标记检索。基于AWQ优化的推理流水线，保留大部分视觉缓存以确保多轮对话保真度。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务中实现预填充加速4.0倍，解码加速2.5倍，端到端加速2.6倍。在文档理解和推理任务中准确率有所提升。

Conclusion: SparseVILA通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，为高效多模态推理开辟了新方向，提供无需训练、架构无关的VLM加速框架，且不牺牲模型能力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

TL;DR: 提出ConsistEdit方法，针对MM-DiT架构设计注意力控制机制，解决现有训练自由编辑方法在编辑强度与一致性保持之间的平衡问题，支持多轮和视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法在同时实现强编辑能力和保持与源内容一致性方面存在困难，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积。大多数方法强制全局一致性，限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出ConsistEdit方法，包含仅视觉注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、以及查询、键、值令牌的差异化操作，实现一致且符合提示的编辑。

Result: 在广泛的图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，包括结构一致和不一致场景。首次实现所有推理步骤和注意力层的编辑，无需手工调整，显著增强可靠性和一致性。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit通过专门针对MM-DiT架构设计的注意力控制机制，成功解决了编辑强度与一致性保持的平衡问题，支持多轮、多区域编辑和渐进结构调整，为训练自由编辑提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

Motivation: 探索量子自然语言处理在语义建模中的潜力，特别是在资源受限的少样本场景下，验证量子模型相比经典模型的参数效率和学习能力。

Method: 使用lambeq库和DisCoCat框架构建参数化量子电路，训练句子对进行语义相关性和推理分类，引入信息增益指标评估效率，并提出基于聚类的架构促进参数共享。

Result: 量子模型在性能上与经典基线相当，但参数数量显著减少；在推理任务中优于随机初始化的transformer模型，在相关性任务中测试误差更低；量子模型的参数学习效率比经典模型高出最多五个数量级。

Conclusion: 量子自然语言处理在低资源、结构敏感的场景中具有巨大潜力，量子模型展现出卓越的参数效率和泛化能力，为未来NLP研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有多种自校正方法被提出，但这些方法的全面评估仍然不足，且LLM是否真能自我校正仍存争议，因此需要系统评估自校正策略的有效性。

Method: 开发CorrectBench基准，评估内在、外部和微调三种自校正策略在常识推理、数学推理和代码生成三个任务上的表现。

Result: 自校正方法能提高准确性，特别是复杂推理任务；混合不同策略能进一步改进但降低效率；推理LLM在额外自校正方法下优化有限且时间成本高；简单思维链基线具有竞争力的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 自校正有潜力提升LLM推理性能，但需在推理能力和操作效率之间寻求平衡，建议进一步研究优化这一平衡。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,
we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between
reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page:

TL;DR: EvolveR是一个让LLM智能体通过完整闭环经验生命周期实现自我改进的框架，包含离线自我蒸馏和在线交互两个关键阶段，在复杂多跳问答基准上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在工具使用方面表现优异，但缺乏从自身经验中系统学习的能力，无法迭代优化问题解决策略，这是一个根本性限制。

Method: EvolveR框架包含两个阶段：1) 离线自我蒸馏 - 将智能体交互轨迹合成为结构化、可复用的抽象策略原则库；2) 在线交互 - 智能体与任务交互并检索蒸馏原则指导决策，积累多样化行为轨迹，通过策略强化机制迭代更新智能体。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答基准测试中，EvolveR实现了优于强大智能体基线的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为智能体不仅从外部数据学习，还能从自身行为后果学习的完整蓝图，为更自主和持续改进的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究量化了提示策略与大型语言模型在系统文献综述筛选阶段的交互作用，发现CoT-few-shot提示提供最可靠的精确度-召回率平衡，GPT-4o-mini在显著降低成本的同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统分析不同提示策略与LLM模型在文献筛选任务中的交互效应，为自动化文献筛选提供实用指导。

Method: 评估6个LLM模型在5种提示类型下的性能，使用准确率、精确度、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: CoT-few-shot提示提供最佳精确度-召回率平衡；零样本提示在需要高召回率时表现最佳；自反思提示因过度包容性和不稳定性而表现不佳。GPT-4o-mini在显著降低成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 推荐采用分阶段工作流：先用低成本模型和结构化提示进行初步筛选，仅对边界案例使用高容量模型。LLM在自动化文献筛选方面具有不均衡但前景广阔的应用潜力。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个合成测试平台，用于系统分析语言模型中统计规律与事实关联的交互如何影响泛化能力，发现上下文多样性和结构对分布内和分布外事实泛化有不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中统计规律与事实关联交互影响的系统分析，特别是它们如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个灵活的合成测试平台，结合通用标记的统计流和抽象事实的源-目标标记对，可独立控制上下文结构和多样性水平。

Result: 研究发现：更高的上下文多样性会延迟分布内事实准确性，但对分布外事实泛化的影响取决于上下文结构；在某些情况下需要多样性才能实现非平凡的事实回忆；即使低多样性阻碍事实回忆，最优多样性水平也取决于训练时长。

Conclusion: 上下文设计和多样性水平的相互作用以不同方式影响泛化能力，通过模型组件干预发现分布外失败源于不同的优化瓶颈，特别是嵌入和解嵌入层的重要性。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过计算方法分析公众对生成式AI的信任与不信任，使用2022-2025年Reddit数据，发现信任与不信任基本平衡，技术性能和可用性是主要维度，个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI融入日常生活，理解公众对其的信任对负责任采用和治理至关重要。现有研究缺乏计算性、大规模和纵向的方法来测量对GenAI和LLMs的信任与不信任。

Method: 使用2022-2025年多年度Reddit数据集（39个子版块，197,618个帖子），结合众包标注和分类模型进行扩展分析。

Result: 信任与不信任随时间基本平衡，主要模型发布时出现转变。技术性能和可用性占主导地位，个人经验是态度形成的最常见原因。不同信任者群体（专家、伦理学家、普通用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究结果为大规模信任分析提供了方法框架，并为理解公众对GenAI不断演变的认知提供了见解。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

Motivation: 当前AI领域缺乏中东和非洲地区的多模态文化多样性数据集，特别是埃及文化相关的数据资源有限。

Method: 设计并运行新的数据收集流程，收集了涵盖地标、食物和民间传说等313个概念的3000多张图像，每个条目都经过人工验证文化真实性和多模态一致性。

Result: 在EgMM-Corpus上评估CLIP模型的零样本性能，Top-1准确率为21.2%，Top-5准确率为36.4%。

Conclusion: 结果表明大规模视觉语言模型存在文化偏见，EgMM-Corpus作为基准数据集对于开发文化感知模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了语言模型对语法的学习程度，通过理论框架验证了字符串概率与语法知识之间的关系，使用28万句对在英语和中文上进行实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否真正学习了语法知识，因为概率和语法性在语言学中是不同概念，需要明确字符串概率能揭示多少LM的底层语法知识。

Method: 基于语料库数据生成过程的简单假设，建立语法、意义和字符串概率关系的理论分析框架，并使用28万句对在英语和中文上进行实证验证。

Result: 验证了三个预测：(1)最小对中字符串概率的相关性；(2)模型与人类在最小对中差异的相关性；(3)语法和非语法字符串在概率空间中分离度差。

Conclusion: 为使用概率来了解LM的结构知识提供了理论基础，并为未来LM语法评估工作指明了方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出两种方法（多元解码和模型引导）来增强语言模型的多元对齐能力，在低资源设置下仅用50个标注样本就能显著提升性能，减少仇恨言论和虚假信息检测中的误报，改善与人类价值观的分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型训练范式假设每个查询只有一个最优答案，导致响应泛化且对齐效果差。需要确保模型能够反映多样化视角和人类价值观的细微差别。

Method: 采用多元解码和模型引导两种方法，在低资源设置下进行实验，仅使用50个标注样本。

Result: 模型引导方法在零样本和少样本基线上表现一致提升，在仇恨言论检测、虚假信息检测等高风险任务中减少误报，在GlobalOpinionQA上改善与人类价值观的分布对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多样性的重要性，展示了语言模型如何适应考虑细微视角，为多元对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

<details>

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法需要为每个用户单独训练适配器，计算成本高且无法实时更新，限制了大规模应用。

Method: 提出Profile-to-PEFT框架，使用端到端训练的超网络将编码后的用户配置文件直接映射到完整的适配器参数集（如LoRA）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在部署时使用更少计算资源的情况下，优于基于提示的个性化和OPPU方法，对分布外用户具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Profile-to-PEFT框架实现了高效、可扩展和自适应的LLM个性化，适用于大规模应用场景。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着后训练技术的发展，LLMs能够通过生成规划令牌来处理复杂的逻辑密集型任务，这引发了一个基本问题：这些模型是否意识到自己"学习"和"思考"了什么？

Method: 在多个需要学习不同策略的任务上实证评估三种核心能力，对比了SFT、DPO和GRPO三种后训练方法的模型表现。

Result: RL训练模型比SFT模型表现出更强的学习行为认知能力和对结构相似新任务的泛化能力，但推理轨迹与最终输出的对齐较弱，GRPO训练模型这一现象最明显。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练使模型更了解自身行为且泛化能力更强，但内部推理与输出的不一致性是需要关注的问题，特别是在GRPO方法中。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Motivation: 在社交媒体影响公共卫生的时代，对抗疫苗怀疑论和错误信息成为关键社会目标。虽然错误信息检测已取得进展，但生成实时定制的反驳论点仍是一个研究不足的领域。

Method: 实验多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳生成，训练分类器对反疫苗推文进行多标签分类（如疫苗效力担忧、副作用、政治影响等），实现情境感知的反驳。

Result: 通过人工判断、LLM评估和自动指标的评估显示这些方法具有很强的一致性。整合标签描述和结构化微调可增强反驳论点的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模缓解疫苗错误信息提供了一个有前景的途径，展示了LLMs在生成有效反驳论点方面的能力。

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

Result: 在三个标准AM基准测试中，两个基准取得SOTA结果，一个基准表现强劲

Conclusion: AASP框架能够有效建模论证推理流程，在论证挖掘任务中实现卓越性能

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

*David Peer,Sebastian Stabinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为自主可信代理（ATA）的神经符号方法，通过将任务解耦为离线知识提取和在线任务处理两个阶段，解决LLM在可信度方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在可信度方面存在幻觉、不稳定性和缺乏透明度等固有局限性，阻碍了其在高风险领域的部署。

Method: 将任务解耦为两个阶段：离线知识提取阶段，LLM将非正式问题规范转换为形式化知识库；在线任务处理阶段，符号决策引擎使用形式化知识库和编码输入来推导可靠结果。

Result: 在复杂推理任务上的评估显示，ATA在完全自动化设置中与最先进的端到端推理模型具有竞争力，同时保持可信度。使用人工验证的知识库时，ATA显著优于更大的模型，并表现出完美的确定性、增强的稳定性以及对提示注入攻击的固有免疫力。

Conclusion: ATA通过基于符号推理的决策生成，为构建下一代透明、可审计和可靠的自主代理提供了实用且可控的架构。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探索了Whisper语音识别模型在二语口语评估中的潜力，通过提取其隐藏表示中的声学和语言特征，仅需训练轻量级分类器就能在GEPT数据集上超越现有先进基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挖掘Whisper这一成熟ASR基础模型在二语口语评估中的未开发潜力，超越仅使用其转录文本的传统方法。

Method: 从Whisper的隐藏表示中提取声学和语言特征，仅训练轻量级分类器，并整合图像和文本提示作为辅助相关线索。

Result: 在GEPT图片描述数据集上表现优异，超越了包括多模态方法在内的现有先进基线，通过整合辅助信息获得额外性能提升。

Conclusion: 即使没有任务特定微调，Whisper模型也能内在地编码口语的等级熟练度模式和语义方面，显示出其作为SLA和其他口语理解任务的强大基础潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

*Syed Rifat Raiyan,Md Farhan Ishmam,Abdullah Al Imran,Mohammad Ali Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt是一种新颖的LLM提示压缩框架，通过保留最语义重要的token来减少输入上下文，在保持任务性能的同时降低成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的冗长输入上下文导致高昂的货币成本、碳足迹和推理延迟，而典型提示中存在大量冗余的低效用token。

Method: 使用GlobEnc和DecompX两种token归因方法为输入序列中的每个token分配显著性分数，按原始顺序保留前k%的token，获得稀疏的压缩提示。

Result: 在情感分析、常识问答和摘要任务中，20%的提示压缩仅带来边际性能损失；但在数学推理任务中性能急剧下降，表明对完整token连续性的强依赖性。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于更细致地理解LLM在性能-效率权衡中的行为，并界定了容忍上下文稀疏性的任务与需要详尽上下文的任务之间的边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

TL;DR: TrajSelector是一个高效的Best-of-N框架，利用LLM的隐藏状态进行过程级评分，通过轻量级验证器评估推理轨迹质量，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法且推理成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有外部测试时扩展方法存在计算开销大和未充分利用LLM内在潜在表示的问题，需要更高效的Best-of-N选择框架。

Method: 使用仅0.6B参数的轻量级验证器，基于采样器LLM的隐藏状态对逐步推理轨迹进行评分，采用端到端数据驱动训练方法，无需大量步骤级标注。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，TrajSelector在Best-of-32设置下比多数投票准确率高4.61%，比现有过程奖励模型高4.31%-12.21%，同时保持更低的推理成本。

Conclusion: TrajSelector通过利用LLM隐藏状态进行过程级评分，实现了高效且有效的Best-of-N选择，在保持性能优势的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有广告视频违规检测方法在精确时间定位、噪声标注和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的检测框架。

Method: 结合课程强化学习和MLLMs，采用渐进式训练策略整合精确和粗略标注数据，使用GRPO发展推理能力，并设计多层次奖励机制确保时间定位和类别预测的一致性。

Result: 在工业数据集和公共基准测试中，RAVEN在违规类别准确性和时间间隔定位方面表现优越，在线A/B测试验证了其实际应用价值，在精确率和召回率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架有效解决了广告视频违规检测中的关键挑战，展示了强大的泛化能力，并成功部署到在线广告服务中。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文通过解释分析扩展了自然语言推理中标注变异的研究范围，不仅关注标注者推理类型的差异，还考察标注步骤的分歧，发现表面标签不一致可能掩盖深层的解释一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注标注者在相同NLI标签下的解释变异，而本文旨在更全面地分析标注者在推理类型和标注步骤上的分歧，以揭示个体差异和解释策略偏好。

Method: 应用LiTEx分类法分析两个英文NLI数据集，从NLI标签一致性、解释相似性和分类法一致性多个维度对齐标注变异，并考虑标注者选择偏见的复合因素。

Result: 发现标注者标签不一致但解释高度相似的实例，表明表面分歧可能掩盖解释层面的一致性；分析还揭示了标注者在解释策略和标签选择上的个体偏好。

Conclusion: 推理类型的一致性比标签一致性更能反映自由文本解释的语义相似性，基于推理的解释具有丰富性，需要谨慎将标签视为绝对真值。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用"退出"作为LLM代理的安全机制，当代理缺乏信心时主动退出，在12个先进LLM上的评估显示这种简单方法能显著提升安全性而几乎不影响帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在复杂环境中运行并产生现实后果，其安全性变得至关重要。多轮代理场景中的不确定性和模糊性会累积，导致超出传统文本生成失败的严重风险。

Method: 利用ToolEmu框架，在12个最先进的LLM上系统评估退出行为，通过添加明确的退出指令来让代理在缺乏信心时主动退出。

Result: 结果显示退出行为带来了高度有利的安全-帮助性权衡：所有模型的安全性平均提升+0.39（0-3分制），专有模型提升+0.64，而帮助性仅平均下降-0.03。

Conclusion: 简单添加明确的退出指令是一种高度有效的安全机制，可立即部署到现有代理系统中，作为高风险应用中自主代理的有效第一道防线。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

Motivation: 现有智能体系统组合方法主要依赖静态语义检索，无法有效考虑能力、成本和实时效用，导致组件重用和组合困难。

Method: 采用在线背包问题启发的方法，通过动态测试候选组件并实时建模其效用，系统性地识别、选择和组装最优智能体组件集合。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法始终位于帕累托前沿，相比基线方法在单智能体设置中成功率提升高达31.6%，在多智能体系统中从37%提升到87%。

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化领域和预算约束下展现出强大的适应性，显著提高了智能体系统的成功率和成本效益。

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Motivation: 同行评审作为科学守门人面临提交量激增和LLM广泛使用的挑战，有缺陷的评审（来自人类专家和AI系统）威胁同行评审生态系统和学术诚信。

Method: 四阶段LLM驱动框架：1)从OpenReview收集ICLR和NeurIPS论文及评审；2)使用GPT-4.1标注评审类型并人工验证；3)通过LLM驱动的合成数据增强解决类别不平衡和数据稀缺；4)微调编码器模型和开源LLM。

Result: 构建了包含6,634篇论文、24,657条真实评审和46,438条合成评审的语料库。有缺陷评审显示较低评分、较高自信度、结构复杂性降低和负面情绪比例更高。ChatGPT出现后AI生成评审显著增加。混合训练显著提升二元任务召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 这是首个用于检测有缺陷同行评审的LLM驱动系统，为同行评审中的AI治理提供证据，并为维护学术诚信的人机协作提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLMs在回答文化相关问题时内部激活路径的重叠情况，研究了语言模型的文化理解机制，发现语言特异性比文化因素对内部表征的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多元文化背景下的广泛应用，准确的文化理解变得至关重要。现有评估多关注输出层面表现，难以揭示驱动响应差异的内部因素，且电路分析研究覆盖语言少、很少聚焦文化。

Method: 通过测量LLMs在回答语义等效问题时内部激活路径的重叠情况，比较两种条件：固定问题语言改变目标国家，以及固定国家改变问题语言。同时使用同语言国家对来分离语言和文化因素。

Result: 结果显示，相同语言、不同国家问题的内部路径重叠度高于不同语言、相同国家问题，表明存在强烈的语言特异性模式。特别是韩国-朝鲜对显示出低重叠度和高变异性，说明语言相似性不能保证内部表征的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化理解机制受语言特异性影响显著，语言相似性不一定导致内部表征对齐，这对跨文化应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

TL;DR: SHALLOW是首个系统分类和量化ASR系统中幻觉现象的基准框架，涵盖词汇、语音、形态和语义四个维度，提供比传统WER更细粒度的错误分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统产生的幻觉转录虽然语法语义合理但与语音输入无关，在医疗和法律等关键领域存在严重风险，而传统评估指标无法有效区分语音错误和幻觉。

Method: 提出SHALLOW框架，通过四个互补维度（词汇、语音、形态、语义）系统分类幻觉现象，并为每个类别定义针对性指标来生成可解释的模型行为分析。

Result: 在不同架构和语音领域的评估显示，SHALLOW指标在识别质量高时与WER强相关，但在WER增加时相关性显著减弱，能捕捉WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。

Conclusion: SHALLOW框架支持对模型弱点的具体诊断，并提供超越聚合错误率的模型改进反馈，特别在退化条件下能有效识别幻觉现象。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本能力增强，区分人类撰写和AI生成文本变得困难，特别是在乌尔都语等低资源语言中缺乏检测工具，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含1800篇人类撰写和1800篇AI生成文本的平衡数据集，进行语言和统计分析，微调三种多语言transformer模型（mdeberta-v3-base、distilbert-base-multilingualcased、xlm-roberta-base）。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于打击乌尔都语社区的错误信息和学术不端行为，并为低资源语言的NLP工具开发做出贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest

*Zhixuan He,Yue Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiMo框架通过四个专门化LLM代理模拟结构化辩论，提升性能与可解释性，在六个基准测试中优于单模型和辩论基线，尤其在数学任务上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型性能强大但缺乏可解释推理，需要一种能同时提升性能和可解释性的方法。

Method: 采用多代理协作框架，四个代理分别代表不同推理范式，通过迭代辩论挑战和优化初始回答，生成可审计的推理链。

Result: 在统一开源设置下，DiMo在六个基准测试中准确率超过广泛使用的单模型和辩论基线，数学任务提升最大。

Conclusion: DiMo是一个语义感知的Web原生多代理框架，结合检索增强推理与结构化论证，支持下游系统检查和重用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

*Yiyang Liu,James C. Liang,Heng Fan,Wenhao Yang,Yiming Cui,Xiaotian Han,Lifu Huang,Dongfang Liu,Qifan Wang,Cheng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过将实例感知信息整合到提示学习中，解决了传统提示学习方法依赖网格搜索、缺乏实例感知信息的问题，实现了高效且有效的参数微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于提示的学习方法存在两个主要问题：1）严重依赖劳动密集型的网格搜索来确定最优提示长度；2）缺乏实例感知信息，导致与输入序列的注意力交互受限。研究发现，简单地加入实例感知信息就能提升模型性能。

Method: 提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，创新性地将实例感知和任务感知信息以近乎参数免费的方式（即单个胶囊提示）整合到提示学习中，利用现成的信息性实例语义。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在各种语言任务上表现出优越性能（例如在T5-Large上平均准确率达84.03%），同时具有高参数效率（例如在Llama3.2-1B上仅使用模型参数的0.003%）。

Conclusion: CaPT方法通过引入'注意力锚'机制，成功保留了关键结构信息的强注意力，并实现了与所有输入标记更活跃的注意力交互，为提示学习提供了一种高效有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [213] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TUuD框架，用于评估大语言模型在动态变化的"现在"参考点下理解时间-事件和事件-事件关系的能力。研究发现LLMs在时间认知上表现出部分类人特征，但对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过空间隐喻来理解时间，使用时间参考框架(t-FoR)来感知相对于"现在"的时间关系。尽管LLMs在自然语言理解方面取得了显著进展，但其时间理解和推理能力仍然有限。

Method: 引入TUuD框架，让LLMs在时间线上动态变化的"现在"参考点下，评估当前时刻与目标事件之间的相似性（0.00-1.00），量化两个时间点之间的感知时间对齐程度。

Result: 四个评估的LLMs显示出对指示性t-FoR的可测量适应性，相似性评分在现在附近达到峰值，并向过去和未来事件递减。然而，这种适应性在近期语境之外会减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出部分类人的时间认知，但其时间推理仍然对参考框架变化和时间距离敏感，表明其时间理解能力仍有局限。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了思维链推理在自然语言理解任务中的应用，发现随着模型规模增大，CoT推理从阻碍NLU性能转变为超越直接标签预测，并开发了专门的方法实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注思维链在推理任务中的作用，忽视了其在自然语言理解任务中的潜在价值，本文旨在系统探索理性推理对NLU任务的影响。

Method: 构建了NLURC数据集，开发了多种理性增强方法，并在NLU任务上进行了系统性探索。

Result: 发现模型规模与CoT效果正相关；大多数理性增强训练方法表现不如仅标签训练，但有一个专门设计的方法能持续改进性能；使用理性训练的LLM在未见过的NLU任务上表现显著提升，达到十倍规模模型的水平。

Conclusion: 理性推理对NLU任务具有重要价值，特别是在模型规模较大时，能显著提升性能并增强可解释性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了LLM中的"变色龙行为"：在多轮对话中面对矛盾问题时立场不稳定的倾向。通过Chameleon基准数据集评估，发现主流LLM都存在严重的立场不稳定问题，特别是在搜索增强型LLM中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成LLM与搜索/检索引擎的系统存在关键漏洞，影响其可靠性。需要系统评估LLM在多轮对话中面对矛盾问题时的立场稳定性。

Method: 创建包含17,770个问答对的Chameleon基准数据集，涵盖1,180个多轮对话和12个争议领域。提出变色龙分数和源重用率两个理论指标，评估Llama-4-Maverick、GPT-4o-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash等模型。

Result: 所有模型都表现出严重的变色龙行为（分数0.391-0.511），GPT-4o-mini表现最差。源重用率与置信度（r=0.627）和立场变化（r=0.429）存在强相关性，表明有限的知识多样性使模型过度依赖查询框架。

Conclusion: 在医疗、法律和金融等需要保持连贯立场的系统中部署LLM之前，必须进行全面的连贯性评估，以确保可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了诗歌中空白空间的重要性，分析了19k首诗歌的空白使用模式，比较了人类创作诗歌与LLM生成诗歌的差异，并探讨了文本处理方法对空白表示的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空白空间是诗歌形式的关键组成部分，反映了诗人对标准化形式的遵循与反抗。尽管诗歌是长期存在的艺术形式，也是LLM的生成任务，但空白空间在NLP社区中未得到足够关注。

Method: 使用来自Poetry Foundation的19k首英语诗歌语料库，分析4k位诗人的空白使用模式。比较了已发表诗歌与LLM生成诗歌及未发表诗歌的空白使用差异，并探讨了不同时期、诗歌形式和数据源的空白使用模式。

Result: 发现不同文本处理方法会导致诗歌数据中空白表示显著不同。发布了2.8k首公共领域诗歌子集以促进进一步研究。

Conclusion: 诗歌中的空白使用模式揭示了诗人的艺术选择，这些发现对LLM预训练数据集的构建策略具有重要意义，强调了保留诗歌格式完整性的重要性。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Beacon基准测试，用于测量大语言模型在真实性和顺从性之间的结构性权衡，揭示了谄媚偏差的存在及其可分解性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在奖励优化过程中混淆了帮助性和礼貌服从，形成了偏好用户同意而非原则性推理的谄媚偏差，需要精确测量这种偏差。

Method: 引入Beacon单轮强制选择基准测试，独立于对话上下文隔离这种偏差，并提出提示级和激活级干预措施来调节这些偏差。

Result: 对12个最先进模型的评估显示，谄媚偏差可分解为稳定的语言和情感子偏差，每个子偏差随模型容量扩展而增强。

Conclusion: Beacon将谄媚重新定义为可测量的规范性错误泛化形式，为研究和缓解大规模生成系统中的对齐漂移提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理在动态对抗游戏中策略推理能力不足，需要不依赖专家标注数据的自动学习方法，而对手选择对学习性能有重要影响但研究不足。

Method: 提出SCO-PAL（Step-level poliCy Optimization through Play-And-Learn）方法，通过设置不同级别对手分析对手选择策略，发现自博弈是最有效的学习方式。

Result: 使用SCO-PAL与自博弈，在6个对抗游戏中相比基线平均胜率提升约30%，对GPT-4达到54.76%的胜率。

Conclusion: 自博弈是提升对抗环境中策略推理的最有效方式，SCO-PAL方法显著提升了语言代理在动态对抗游戏中的表现。

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend
extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation
methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Conclusion: 平衡的联合监督和分阶段适应对于句子嵌入模型的领域适应至关重要，MOSAIC框架能够有效提升模型在专业领域的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

Motivation: 理解LLMs何时依赖真实知识而非表面启发式进行推理，通过实体比较任务提供系统分析的基础。

Method: 使用实体比较任务（如河流长度比较），分析模型预测与数值知识的关系，识别三种启发式偏见：实体流行度、提及顺序和语义共现。

Result: 小模型依赖表面线索胜过数值知识，大模型能选择性使用更可靠的数值知识，思维链提示能引导所有模型使用数值特征。

Conclusion: 模型规模影响知识使用策略，大模型能更好地区分何时依赖知识而非启发式，思维链提示能改善推理过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的检索-重排框架，通过微调LLM进行跨体裁作者归属任务，在HIATUS基准测试上显著超越先前最优方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨体裁作者归属任务中避免依赖主题线索，而是学习独立于文本主题的作者特定语言模式的问题

Method: 采用两阶段检索-重排框架，针对重排器设计了专门的数据策展策略，避免使用IR领域常用的训练策略

Result: 在HIATUS的HRS1和HRS2跨体裁作者归属基准测试上，分别比先前最优方法提升了22.3和34.4个绝对Success@8点

Conclusion: 提出的LLM检索-重排管道在跨体裁作者归属任务中表现优异，证明了专门训练策略对于学习作者区分性信号的重要性

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

TL;DR: CoRUS框架通过角色理论模拟基于角色的提问，发现在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域，用户角色（患者、照顾者、从业者）会系统性地影响LLM的回应方式，脆弱角色获得更多支持性回应但知识内容减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估大多忽略提问者角色，而在阿片类药物使用障碍等敏感领域，考虑用户背景对提供无障碍、无污名化回应至关重要。

Method: 基于角色理论和在线OUD康复社区数据构建提问者角色分类法，模拟15,321个嵌入角色目标、行为和经验的提问，用于评估五个LLM。

Result: 角色模拟问题高度可信且与现实数据可比。相同问题不同角色导致系统性差异：脆弱角色（患者、照顾者）比从业者获得更多支持性回应（+17%）但知识内容减少（-19%）。

Conclusion: 用户角色的隐式信号会塑造模型回应，提供了角色知情对话AI评估的方法论。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

TL;DR: FinSight是一个多智能体框架，通过CAVM架构、迭代视觉增强机制和两阶段写作框架，能够生成高质量的多模态财务报告，在事实准确性、分析深度和呈现质量方面显著优于现有基线系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统难以完全自动化生成专业的财务报告，这是一个劳动密集且智力要求高的过程。

Method: 采用CAVM架构统一外部数据、工具和智能体；提出迭代视觉增强机制逐步优化原始视觉输出；使用两阶段写作框架将简洁的分析链扩展为连贯的多模态报告。

Result: 在各种公司和行业级任务上的实验表明，FinSight在事实准确性、分析深度和呈现质量方面显著优于所有基线系统。

Conclusion: FinSight展示了生成接近人类专家质量报告的清晰路径，为财务报告自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and
intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully
automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出神经群通信（NGC）框架，将神经网络重新构想为相互作用的神经群动态系统，通过低维信号交换实现参数压缩，在保持推理能力的同时提升模型效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代神经网络规模不断扩大带来的效率低下和可解释性差的问题，探索如何构建能够学习高效、模块化和可解释表示的大型神经系统的核心问题。

Method: 将神经网络视为神经群交互的动态系统，权重作为神经状态间的瞬时交互，通过神经群间的迭代通信进行计算。引入神经稳定性度量来量化序列处理中神经激活向稳定模式的收缩。

Result: 在大语言模型中实现NGC，在适度压缩下在复杂推理基准测试中表现更优，在相同压缩率下持续优于标准低秩近似和跨层基共享方法。

Conclusion: NGC框架通过结构化神经群动态与高维学习系统中的泛化能力相关，为构建高效、模块化和可解释的神经网络提供了新途径。

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于心理学感知理论的多模态知识理解基准，评估了30个先进语言模型在多种感官维度上的表现，发现视觉语言模型在感知知识理解上并未优于纯文本模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态语言模型取得显著进展，但尚不清楚视觉基础是否比纯文本模型更能增强其对具身知识的理解。

Method: 构建基于心理学感知理论的具身知识理解基准，涵盖视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉等外部感官和内部感知，通过向量比较和问答任务评估模型感知能力。

Result: 视觉语言模型在两种任务中均未优于纯文本模型；模型在视觉维度表现显著差于其他感官维度；向量表示易受词形和频率影响；模型在空间感知和推理问题上表现困难。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要更有效地将具身知识整合到语言模型中，以增强其对物理世界的理解能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

TL;DR: ChiKhaPo是一个大规模多语言基准测试，包含8个子任务，覆盖2700多种语言，用于评估生成模型的词汇理解和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试主要针对高资源或中资源语言，且多关注推理和生成等高阶任务，而实际上大语言模型在世界上3800多种书面语言中缺乏基本的语言能力。

Method: 基于现有词典、单语数据和双语语料构建ChiKhaPo基准，包含8个难度不同的子任务，专门评估词汇理解和生成能力。

Result: 测试了6个最先进的模型，发现它们在ChiKhaPo基准上表现不佳，并分析了影响性能的因素，包括语言家族、语言资源丰富度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo基准能够促进和鼓励大语言模型的大规模多语言基准测试，填补了现有基准在语言覆盖范围上的不足。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PROMPT-MII是一个基于强化学习的元学习框架，能够为任意新数据集生成紧凑的指令提示，在保持与上下文学习相当性能的同时，显著减少推理所需的token数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然有效，但随着上下文长度增长会产生高昂的推理成本，需要一种更紧凑的提示方法来替代传统的上下文学习。

Method: 提出PROMPT-MII框架，使用强化学习元学习一个指令归纳模型，该模型能够为任意新数据集动态生成紧凑的描述性提示。在3,000多个多样化分类数据集上进行训练。

Result: 在90个未见任务上评估，PROMPT-MII将下游模型质量提高了4-9个F1点（相对提升10-20%），在匹配上下文学习性能的同时，所需token数量减少了3-13倍。

Conclusion: PROMPT-MII提供了一种高效的指令归纳方法，能够在显著降低推理成本的同时保持模型性能，为大规模语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次应用参数高效微调(PEFT)技术，使用LoRA和QLoRA方法在孟加拉语仇恨言论检测任务上，在BD-SHS数据集上微调了三个大语言模型，Llama-3.2-3B取得了92.23%的最高F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语社交媒体平台仇恨言论激增，特别是针对妇女和青少年。现有方法要么依赖计算成本高的全模型微调，要么使用专有API，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效微调技术，在BD-SHS数据集(50,281条标注评论)上微调三个指令调优的大语言模型(Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B、Mistral-7B)，每个模型训练参数少于1%，可在单张消费级GPU上运行。

Result: Llama-3.2-3B获得最高F1分数92.23%，Mistral-7B为88.94%，Gemma-3-4B为80.25%。

Conclusion: PEFT被证明是孟加拉语及相关低资源语言仇恨言论检测的实用且可复现策略。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

*Amit Moryossef,Clara Meister,Pavel Stepachev,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UTF8Tokenizer是一个极简的字节级分词器，直接将文本映射到UTF-8编码对应的字节ID，使用C0控制字节编码特殊行为，提供更快的分词速度、更小的传输开销和可共享的嵌入表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的字节级分词方法存在超出范围的ID或需要辅助标记的问题，作者希望设计一个更简洁高效的分词器，利用ASCII原始设计理念将控制信息与可打印文本一起编码。

Method: 使用UTF-8编码的字节作为分词ID，所有特殊行为（如填充、边界、对话结构等）都通过C0控制字节编码，无需额外标记。采用256维嵌入表，并引入位偏置嵌入来暴露字节位结构。

Result: 实现了14倍的分词加速和8倍于int64的传输减少，嵌入表可在模型间对齐共享，训练时收敛性得到改善。

Conclusion: UTF8Tokenizer提供了一种高效、简洁的分词方案，通过回归ASCII设计原则实现了性能提升和模型兼容性。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种词汇表压缩方法，通过将词形变化表示为基词向量和变换向量的组合，而不是为每个表面形式分配独立token，从而释放词汇表空间用于更多样化的词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词算法将词形变化（如"walk"->"walked"）视为不同token，占用了有限的词汇表空间，影响了低频词和多语言覆盖。

Method: 使用变换向量（加法偏移量）在嵌入空间中表示词形变化，将词汇表重新设计为共享基词和变换向量的组合形式。

Result: 在多个LLM和五种语言上测试，最多可移除10%的词汇条目，扩展了词汇覆盖范围，对下游任务性能影响最小，且无需修改模型权重。

Conclusion: 研究结果促使重新思考词汇表设计，从字符串枚举转向利用语言底层结构的组合式词汇表。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态防御框架，通过在线学习对抗迭代越狱攻击，同时使用Past-Direction Gradient Damping防止过拟合，显著提升了防御效果和无害任务响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法无法主动破坏迭代越狱攻击的动态试错循环，这种攻击方法通过反复重写提示词来诱导有害输出，利用模型之前的响应指导每次新迭代。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的方法动态更新防御策略，通过在线学习响应每个新的越狱提示；引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping来抑制对攻击期间探索的有限输入重写过拟合。

Result: 在三个大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法显著优于五种现有防御方法对抗五种迭代越狱方法，同时提示优化策略提高了无害任务的响应质量。

Conclusion: 该动态防御框架有效对抗迭代越狱攻击，在保持防御效果的同时提升了无害任务的响应质量，为LLM安全提供了新的防御思路。

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试主要关注自然语言理解中的显式信息提取，缺乏针对隐含信息、语用推理和跨文档话语跟踪的更具挑战性的多语言基准。

Method: 开发了DiscoTrack基准测试，包含12种语言和四个话语理解层次：显著性识别、实体跟踪、话语关系和桥接推理。

Result: 评估表明，即使是最先进的模型，这些任务仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: DiscoTrack填补了LLM基准测试在话语跟踪和隐含信息理解方面的空白，为模型评估提供了更具挑战性的多语言基准。

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are
still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of
explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar-
geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 该论文发现基于LLM的搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，提出了SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，在保持问答性能的同时显著降低有害性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员主要关注提升搜索代理的实用性，但其安全行为研究不足。研究发现搜索代理比基础LLM更容易产生有害输出，且实用性导向的微调会加剧这种风险

Method: 提出SafeSearch方法，采用多目标强化学习，结合最终输出的安全/实用性奖励和查询级别的惩罚机制，惩罚不安全查询并奖励安全查询

Result: 实验显示SafeSearch在三个红队测试数据集上减少代理有害性超过70%，同时产生安全有用的响应，并与仅实用性微调的代理保持相当的问答性能

Conclusion: 查询级别的奖励机制在联合提升安全性和实用性方面有效，需要同时关注搜索代理的安全性和实用性对齐

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的模型在毒性评论检测中计算成本高、在少数毒性类别上性能下降的问题，以及传统集成方法缺乏语义适应性的局限。

Method: 使用可学习参考向量通过余弦相似性调节上下文嵌入，整合多源嵌入（GloVe、FastText、BERT CLS）、字符级BiLSTM、嵌入空间SMOTE和自适应焦点损失。

Result: 在Jigsaw毒性评论基准测试中达到96.0%准确率和0.88宏F1，在威胁和身份仇恨类别上分别比BERT提升33%和28%，参数减少15倍，推理延迟50ms。

Conclusion: 轻量级、理论指导的架构可以在不平衡、领域特定的NLP任务中超越大型预训练模型，建立了新的效率适应性前沿。

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型的提示敏感性现象，提出通过语义空间采样和改述扰动来改善不确定性校准，并引入新的不确定性分解度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对语义相同但表述不同的提示会产生不同的答案分布，这表明模型输出的不确定性可能不能真实反映其对提示含义的不确定性。

Method: 将提示敏感性建模为泛化误差，通过语义概念空间的改述扰动进行采样，并引入新的不确定性分解度量方法来量化提示敏感性带来的不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，跨语义概念空间的采样能改善不确定性校准而不损失准确性，新的分解度量能有效量化提示敏感性对模型不确定性的贡献。

Conclusion: 本文提出了改善提示敏感语言模型中不确定性校准的新方法，并证明某些大语言模型未能对其输入含义表现出一致的一般推理能力。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

TL;DR: 该研究发现基于推理的大语言模型在思维过程中会聚合社会偏见，揭示了两种导致偏见聚合的失败模式，并提出了一种轻量级的提示缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于推理的大语言模型通过内部结构化思维过程在复杂任务中表现出色，但这种思维过程会聚合社会刻板印象，导致偏见结果，而这种现象的底层机制尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统研究思维过程中的机制，识别出两种导致社会偏见聚合的失败模式：刻板印象重复和无关信息注入。基于这些发现，提出了一种轻量级的基于提示的缓解方法，让模型根据这些特定失败模式审查自己的初始推理。

Result: 在问答（BBQ和StereoSet）和开放式（BOLD）基准测试上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了偏见，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型思维过程中社会偏见聚合的机制，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法，为减少AI系统中的偏见提供了新思路。

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: VeriMAP是一个用于多智能体协作的验证感知规划框架，通过分解任务、建模子任务依赖关系，并编码验证函数来提升系统鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作在规划、协调和验证方面面临挑战，执行失败往往源于任务解释、输出格式或智能体间交接的细微偏差。

Method: VeriMAP规划器分解任务，建模子任务依赖关系，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的子任务验证函数。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的评估显示，VeriMAP优于单智能体和多智能体基线，同时增强了系统鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 验证感知规划能够在多智能体系统中实现可靠的协调和迭代优化，无需依赖外部标签或注释。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

TL;DR: DVAGen是一个开源统一框架，用于训练、评估和可视化动态词汇增强的语言模型，解决了现有方法代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持和推理扩展性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇表训练的语言模型难以泛化到新词或词汇表外词汇，限制了处理多样化词汇组合的灵活性。现有动态词汇方法存在代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持和推理扩展性有限等挑战。

Method: DVAGen框架模块化处理流程以便定制，与开源LLM无缝集成，首次提供CLI和WebUI工具进行实时结果检查，支持批量推理显著提高吞吐量。

Result: 验证了动态词汇方法在现代LLM上的有效性，并展示了批量推理支持，显著提升了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen提供了一个全面、可扩展的解决方案，克服了现有动态词汇方法的局限性，为语言模型处理多样化词汇提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法，发现简单的无训练查询增强方法往往能与更昂贵的RL方法表现相当甚至更好，并提出了结合两者优势的混合方法OPQE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询增强方法主要有两种：基于提示的方法和基于强化学习的方法，但它们在一致的实验条件下尚未被系统比较。

Method: 提出了OPQE方法，该方法不是重写查询，而是让LLM策略学习生成能最大化检索性能的伪文档，结合了提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化。

Result: 简单的无训练查询增强方法通常与RL方法表现相当或更好，而OPQE方法优于单独的提示方法和基于RL的重写方法。

Conclusion: 协同方法能产生最佳结果，结合提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化可以显著提升检索性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明人们在理解AI生成的讽刺时不会完全采用意向立场，神经和行为数据都显示人们对AI的讽刺理解投入的认知努力较少，更倾向于将其视为计算错误而非有意沟通。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地被部署为社交代理并训练产生幽默和讽刺，需要研究人们在遇到诙谐的AI言论时，是将其视为有意沟通还是纯粹的计算输出。

Method: 比较了人们对AI与人类来源讽刺语句的行为和神经反应，使用ERP成分：P200反映早期不一致性检测，P600索引重新解释不一致性为故意讽刺的认知努力。

Result: 行为上，参与者对两种来源的不一致性都归因于有意沟通，但对AI的归因显著少于人类；神经数据显示AI生成讽刺的P200和P600效应减弱，表明检测和重新分析的认知努力减少。

Conclusion: 尽管当前LLMs具有语言复杂性，但实现真正的社交代理不仅需要语言能力，还需要人类对人工代理的意向性归因方式发生转变。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

*Jiaqi Leng,Xiang Hu,Junxiong Wang,Jianguo Li,Wei Wu,Yucheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了基于分块的稀疏注意力模型，提出了三个关键设计原则：表达性强的分块编码器、旁路残差路径和预训练中的强制选择稀疏性，实现了从4K上下文到3200万tokens的训练无关长度外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效处理长上下文是语言模型的关键挑战。标准Transformer受限于二次复杂度和长度外推能力差，而滑动窗口注意力等替代架构由于固定大小的内存而无法有效利用完整上下文。需要理解分块稀疏注意力成功的关键架构原则。

Method: 通过统一框架和全面消融研究，识别了三个关键设计原则：1) 具有专用CLS令牌的表达性非线性分块编码器；2) 旁路残差路径稳定集成检索到的全局信息；3) 预训练中强制选择稀疏性以弥合训练-测试分布差距。

Result: 结合这些原则，在RULER和BABILong上实现了从4K上下文到3200万tokens的训练无关长度外推，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究为开发未来高性能长上下文语言模型提供了一套清晰且经验基础的设计原则，证明了分块内信息处理和地标生成的理论动机。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的注意力转移框架，通过重要性感知抑制和注意力引导保留增强，在保持模型效用的同时实现选择性遗忘，解决了传统遗忘方法在效用保留和幻觉风险之间的困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理敏感数据时存在隐私风险，现有遗忘方法面临两难：激进遗忘损害模型效用，保守策略保留效用但可能导致幻觉响应，限制了LLM在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用注意力转移框架，包含两个核心组件：上下文保持抑制（衰减对事实承载标记的注意力）和幻觉抵抗响应塑造（阻止对遗忘内容的虚构补全），通过双损失目标联合优化。

Result: 在ToFU基准上准确率比最先进方法提高15%，在TDEC基准上提高10%，同时保持竞争力的无幻觉遗忘效果，在遗忘效果、泛化能力和响应可靠性之间实现了更优平衡。

Conclusion: 注意力转移框架成功解决了LLM选择性遗忘中的关键挑战，在保持模型效用的同时有效减少幻觉风险，为知识密集型应用中的可靠LLM部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出StreamingThinker框架，让大语言模型能够在阅读输入的同时进行推理，而不是等到全部输入完成后再开始思考，显著降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理范式需要等待完整输入后才开始思考，这在动态场景中引入了不必要的延迟并削弱了对早期信息的注意力。受人类边阅读边思考的认知过程启发，设计了流式思考范式。

Method: StreamingThinker框架包含流式CoT生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理。通过流式推理单元、流式注意力掩码和位置编码，以及并行KV缓存实现输入编码与推理生成的解耦。

Result: 在Qwen3模型系列上的实验表明，StreamingThinker在保持与批量思考相当性能的同时，将推理开始前的token等待时间减少了80%，最终答案生成的时间延迟减少了60%以上。

Conclusion: 流式思考范式能够有效降低LLM推理延迟，同时保持推理质量，为动态场景下的实时推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了VideoBiasEval框架，用于评估视频生成中的社会偏见，发现对齐调优会强化并稳定化社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型在通过奖励模型进行对齐调优时，可能无意中编码并放大了社会偏见，需要系统评估这些偏见。

Method: 引入VideoBiasEval诊断框架，基于社会偏见分类学，采用基于事件的提示策略，并开发多粒度指标来评估偏见。

Result: 对齐调优不仅强化了表征偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，产生了更平滑但更刻板的描绘。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程中进行偏见感知的评估和缓解，以确保公平和社会负责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新闻媒体通过报道框架影响公众情绪，负面或情绪化的标题往往吸引更多关注并传播更快，这促使媒体采用更能引发强烈反应的报道方式。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 4B模型对30万条孟加拉语新闻标题和内容进行零样本推理，识别每篇文章的主导情绪和整体基调。

Result: 研究发现负面情绪明显占主导，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望，不同媒体对相似故事的报道存在显著的情感差异。

Conclusion: 基于这些发现，提出了以人为本的新闻聚合器的设计理念，通过可视化情感线索帮助读者识别日常新闻中隐藏的情感框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

Conclusion: TaxoAlign能够有效弥合人类生成与自动生成分类法之间的差距，为自动文献综述生成提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

Method: 使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large数据集，评估了6种基于文本和8种基于图的表示学习方法，分析了词汇线索、交互动态及其多模态融合。

Result: 多模态模型优于单模态基线，mBERT + WD-SGCN模型在反社会行为检测任务上达到0.718的最佳性能，在同伴群体识别（0.286）和霸凌分析（0.606）上表现良好。

Conclusion: 多模态模型能有效处理隐式攻击、角色转换和上下文依赖的敌意等微妙的反社会行为现象。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,
and context-dependent hostility.

*Chenghao Zhang,Guanting Dong,Xinyu Yang,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nyx，一个用于通用检索增强生成（URAG）的统一混合模态检索器，通过四阶段自动化管道构建NyxQA数据集，采用两阶段训练框架，在视觉语言任务中显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统主要关注单模态文本，但在现实场景中查询和文档可能包含混合模态（如文本和图像），需要解决混合模态信息的检索和推理挑战。

Method: 提出Nyx混合模态检索器，构建NyxQA数据集，采用两阶段训练：先在NyxQA和开源检索数据集上预训练，然后使用下游视觉语言模型的反馈进行监督微调。

Result: Nyx不仅在标准文本RAG基准上表现竞争力，在更通用的URAG设置中表现优异，显著提升视觉语言任务的生成质量。

Conclusion: Nyx成功解决了混合模态检索增强生成的挑战，为现实世界多模态信息检索和生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [252] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现指令调优大语言模型在简单自包含指令执行方面存在不足，对选项标签格式敏感，且缺乏对原子指令的严格遵守。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索指令调优大语言模型执行简单自包含指令的能力，这是复杂指令遵循的基础但尚未充分研究。

Method: 在修改的MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准上评估20个指令调优大语言模型，系统性地改变选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），在四种范式下测试模型表现。

Result: 标签格式变化导致显著性能波动（如罗马数字vs数字下降30.45%）；无指令时性能进一步下降；移除选项内容后模型无法超越随机基线；少量样本无法提升鲁棒性；大模型准确率更高但指令遵循仍不一致。

Conclusion: 当前指令调优范式存在不足，需要专门针对原子指令遵循的评估方法和训练策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

TL;DR: 提出了EduAdapt基准，包含48K个按年级标记的科学问答对，评估LLM在不同年级的适应性，发现大模型在低年级表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在学术基准上表现良好，但无法根据学生年级水平调整回答，这在K-12教育中至关重要。

Method: 创建EduAdapt基准数据集，包含9个科学学科的年级标记问答对，评估开源LLM在不同年级的表现。

Result: 大模型整体表现更好，但在低年级（1-5年级）仍难以生成合适回答。

Conclusion: EduAdapt是首个评估LLM年级适应性的框架，旨在通过改进训练和提示策略开发更适合教育需求的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

TL;DR: Ladder-base是首个使用GRPO强化学习方法训练的中医专用大语言模型，在中医推理任务上超越了通用大模型和领域专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医知识体系独特，现有中医专用大模型在一致性、数据质量和评估标准方面存在局限，需要更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct基础模型，使用GRPO强化学习方法，在TCM-Ladder基准的文本子集上进行训练，80%数据用于训练，20%用于验证和测试。

Result: Ladder-base在多项推理指标上表现优异，超越了GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3等通用大模型以及BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing等中医专用模型。

Conclusion: GRPO为将大语言模型与专家级中医推理对齐提供了有效策略，支持开发可信赖且临床基础扎实的中医人工智能系统。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

TL;DR: 开发了BenCao，一个基于ChatGPT的中医多模态助手，通过自然语言指令调优而非参数重训练，整合结构化知识库、诊断数据和专家反馈，在中医问答和诊断任务中表现优于通用和中医领域模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大语言模型应用于中医面临挑战，因为中医依赖整体推理、隐含逻辑和多模态诊断线索。现有中医领域大语言模型缺乏多模态整合、可解释性和临床应用性。

Result: 在单选题基准测试和多模态分类任务评估中，BenCao在诊断、草药识别和体质分类方面表现优于通用领域和中医领域模型。该系统已在OpenAI GPTs商店部署，截至2025年10月已有近1000名全球用户访问。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过自然语言指令调优和多模态整合开发中医领域大语言模型是可行的，为生成式AI与传统医学推理的对齐提供了实用框架，并为现实世界部署提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

*Tiancheng Hu,Benjamin Minixhofer,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现对齐后训练不仅导致任务准确率下降，还造成严重的校准损失，使模型过度自信、可靠性降低且输出多样性减少。通过简单的权重插值方法可以找到帕累托最优解，在提升准确率的同时恢复校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上"对齐税"被定义为任务准确率的下降，但本文发现对齐过程还会导致严重的校准损失，使模型变得过度自信、可靠性降低，且输出多样性减少。

Method: 采用简单的后处理干预方法：在对齐前后的模型权重之间进行插值。这种方法计算效率高，不需要重新训练。

Result: 研究发现权重插值过程能够一致地找到帕累托最优解，这些插值模型不仅准确率超过两个父模型，还显著恢复了在对齐过程中损失的校准性能。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并提供了一种计算高效的方法来缓解对齐税的全部影响，能够产生既更强大又更可靠的模型。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

*Yushi Yang,Shreyansh Padarha,Andrew Lee,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL训练的搜索模型虽然继承了指令调优的拒绝能力，但存在脆弱性。两种简单攻击（搜索攻击和多搜索攻击）可大幅降低模型的安全性能，暴露了当前RL训练忽视查询有害性的核心弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL训练的搜索模型的安全特性，发现其虽然具备拒绝有害请求的能力，但这种安全性很脆弱，需要开发安全感知的代理RL训练方法。

Method: 使用两种简单攻击方法：搜索攻击（强制模型以搜索开始响应）和多搜索攻击（鼓励模型重复搜索），在Qwen和Llama两个模型家族上进行测试。

Result: 攻击使拒绝率降低高达60.0%，答案安全性降低82.5%，搜索查询安全性降低82.4%。攻击通过触发模型在生成拒绝标记前产生有害的镜像搜索查询而成功。

Conclusion: 当前RL训练存在核心弱点，只奖励有效查询生成而不考虑其有害性，导致搜索模型存在易被利用的漏洞，迫切需要开发安全感知的代理RL训练流程。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines
optimising for safe search.

Method: 探索了基于单语和多语BERT的模型，这些模型在通用领域文本上训练，用于从英语、西班牙语和意大利语的临床病例报告中提取疾病和药物提及。

Result: 在西班牙语疾病识别上获得77.88%的F1分数，西班牙语药物识别92.09%，英语药物识别91.74%，意大利语药物识别88.9%，所有子任务均优于测试排行榜的平均值和中位数。

Conclusion: 基于BERT的深度上下文嵌入模型能够有效提升低资源语言临床文本的命名实体识别性能，为多语言临床NLP系统的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian
Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1
scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean/median values

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语翻译在机器翻译中是一个重要挑战，特别是对于乌尔都语等低资源语言，之前的研究关注有限。

Method: 构建首个乌尔都语到英语习语翻译评估数据集，评估多种开源LLM和NMT系统，使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET和XCOMET等自动指标评估翻译质量。

Result: 提示工程相比直接翻译能提升习语翻译质量，但不同提示类型间的性能差异较小；原生乌尔都语输入比罗马化乌尔都语能产生更准确的习语翻译。

Conclusion: 文本表示对翻译质量有显著影响，原生乌尔都语在习语翻译上表现优于罗马化乌尔都语，提示工程是提升习语翻译质量的有效方法。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了构建更公平的多语言AI医疗系统的实际途径，通过提供文化相关知识的上下文可以有效改善事实对齐。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

TL;DR: ReXMoE是一种新颖的MoE架构，通过跨层复用专家来超越现有的层局部路由机制，在固定参数预算下提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构受限于层局部路由机制，每层只能使用自己的专家池，需要在专家维度和路由多样性之间进行权衡。ReXMoE旨在打破这种限制，允许路由器跨相邻层复用专家。

Method: 提出ReXMoE架构，解耦专家维度与每层预算，允许路由器跨层复用专家。采用渐进式缩放路由(PSR)策略，在训练过程中逐步增加候选专家池。

Result: 在0.5B到7B参数规模的不同架构模型上，ReXMoE在固定架构维度下持续提升语言建模和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ReXMoE为参数高效且可扩展的MoE基础LLMs提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Method: 提出DETree方法，将不同生成过程的关系建模为层次亲和树结构，引入专门损失函数对齐文本表示与树结构。开发了RealBench基准数据集，包含各种人类-AI协作过程产生的混合文本。

Result: 该方法在混合文本检测任务中提升了性能，显著增强了在分布外场景下的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在少样本学习条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于训练的方法在分布外设置中具有前景，DETree通过建模文本生成过程的层次关系，有效解决了复杂AI-人类协作文本的检测挑战。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

*Zihan Liu,Shun Zheng,Xumeng Wen,Yang Wang,Jiang Bian,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER)概率框架，通过并行运行多个长时程自演化过程，即使验证和修正能力较弱，也能显著扩展小规模开放权重模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前验证-精炼框架依赖于强大可靠的验证和修正能力，但在开放权重的小规模模型中这些能力很脆弱。需要一种方法能在验证能力较弱的情况下仍能有效扩展推理极限。

Method: 将迭代推理建模为马尔可夫链，每个步骤代表解空间中的随机转移。通过并行运行多个自演化过程，放大微小的改进概率，使模型渐进接近正确答案。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B模型上应用DSER，在AIME 2024-2025基准测试中解决了5个之前无法解决的问题，总体性能提升，使这个紧凑模型通过多数投票超越了其600B参数教师的单轮准确率。

Conclusion: DSER不仅提供了测试时扩展的实用方法，还诊断了当前开放权重推理器的根本局限性，为开发具有强大内在自演化能力的新一代模型指明了研究方向。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多语言句子嵌入学习方法，结合单语和跨语言表示学习的最佳方法，显著减少了平行训练数据需求，在112种语言上实现了83.7%的双文本检索准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BERT在单语句子嵌入学习方面很有效，但基于BERT的跨语言句子嵌入尚未被充分探索。本文旨在研究如何学习高质量的多语言句子嵌入。

Method: 结合了掩码语言建模(MLM)、翻译语言建模(TLM)、双编码器翻译排序和加性边际softmax等最佳方法，并引入预训练的多语言语言模型。

Result: 将平行训练数据需求减少了80%，在Tatoeba数据集112种语言上达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率（远超LASER的65.5%），同时在单语迁移学习基准上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了多语言句子嵌入性能，并发布了支持109+种语言的最佳多语言句子嵌入模型。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EliCal框架，通过两阶段方法实现LLMs的诚实对齐：首先使用廉价的自我一致性监督来激发内部置信度，然后用少量正确性标注进行校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的诚实对齐方法要么依赖无训练的置信度估计，要么需要大规模正确性标注进行训练，成本高昂。需要一种标注高效的训练方法来实现通用的诚实对齐。

Method: EliCal两阶段框架：1) 使用自我一致性监督激发内部置信度；2) 用少量正确性标注校准置信度。同时发布了HonestyBench基准，包含10个问答数据集和63万实例。

Result: EliCal仅需1k正确性标注（占全监督的0.18%）就能达到接近最优的对齐效果，在未见过的MMLU任务上表现优于仅校准的基线方法。

Conclusion: EliCal为LLMs的通用诚实对齐提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBench是首个大规模标准化基准测试，用于评估LLM模拟人类行为的能力，统一了20个数据集，发现当前最佳LLM模拟能力有限(40.8/100)，性能随模型规模对数线性增长，存在对齐-模拟权衡，且在模拟特定人口群体时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM模拟人类行为的评估方法碎片化，基于定制任务和指标，导致结果难以比较。需要建立标准化基准来推动LLM模拟能力的科学发展。

Method: 引入SimBench基准测试，统一20个多样化数据集，涵盖从道德决策到经济选择等任务，基于全球参与者数据，系统评估LLM的模拟能力。

Result: 当前最佳LLM模拟能力有限(40.8/100)；性能随模型规模对数线性增长；推理时计算增加不提升性能；存在对齐-模拟权衡；模拟特定人口群体时表现不佳；模拟能力与深度知识推理能力强相关(r=0.939)。

Conclusion: SimBench使LLM模拟能力的进展可测量，将加速开发更忠实的人类行为模拟器。当前LLM模拟能力仍有很大提升空间，特别是在处理多样性和特定群体模拟方面。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多任务学习框架，将自回归LLM与临床推理对齐，用于癌症治疗结果预测。通过三种对齐策略（标准微调、思维链提示、GRPO强化学习）在MSK-CHORD数据集上实现生存分类、时间回归和自然语言推理生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在生物医学NLP中表现良好但缺乏结构化推理能力，而癌症治疗结果预测需要既准确又可解释的模型来处理异质临床数据。

Method: 使用多任务学习框架，训练模型同时执行二元生存分类、连续生存时间回归和自然语言推理生成。评估三种对齐策略：标准监督微调、思维链提示和GRPO强化学习。

Result: 思维链提示使F1提高+6.0%，MAE降低12%；GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE和BERTScore上达到最先进的解释性和预测性能。现有生物医学LLM由于架构限制常无法产生有效推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 推理感知对齐在多任务临床建模中至关重要，为精准肿瘤学中可解释、可信赖的LLM设定了新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析语言模型如何编码歧义性，发现微调后的模型在嵌入空间中形成模块化、非凸的区域，这些区域与模型预测高度一致，但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标量评估指标（如准确率）无法捕捉模型内部如何表示歧义性，特别是在人类标注者存在分歧的情况下。需要新的方法来理解模型如何处理主观性NLP任务中的不确定性。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来分析RoBERTa-Large在MD-Offense数据集上的嵌入空间结构，与传统可视化工具（如PCA、UMAP）进行对比。

Result: 微调将嵌入空间重构为模块化、非凸的区域，98%以上的连通组件展现出≥90%的预测纯度。但在歧义数据中，模型结构与真实标签的对齐度下降，揭示了结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的隐藏张力。

Conclusion: Mapper是一个强大的诊断工具，能够直接揭示决策区域、边界塌陷和过度自信的聚类，为理解模型如何解决歧义性提供了新的视角，并可能为主动建模策略提供拓扑指标。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的语言混淆门控（LCG）方法，在解码过程中过滤token而不改变基础LLM，显著减少语言混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常出现语言混淆问题，即文本生成时无意中混合多种语言。现有解决方案要么需要重新训练模型，要么无法区分有害的混淆和可接受的语码转换。

Method: 使用规范调整的自蒸馏训练LCG来预测适当的语言家族，仅在需要时应用掩码。该方法基于语言混淆不频繁、正确语言token通常位于预测前列、高资源语言的输出token嵌入规范更大等发现。

Result: 在包括Qwen3、GPT-OSS、Gemma3、Llama3.1在内的各种模型上评估，LCG显著减少了语言混淆，通常降低一个数量级，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: LCG是一种有效的轻量级插件解决方案，能够显著减少语言混淆问题，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在代码任务中表现良好，但未考虑代码中潜在的高阶数据相关性，限制了性能提升。

Method: 识别代码中的三种高阶相关性（抽象语法树家族相关性、词汇相关性、行相关性），设计token和超边生成器，改进超图神经网络架构并与适配器调优结合，提出HGAdapter方法。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同语言的代码摘要和代码克隆检测任务中均能不同程度提升PLMs性能。

Conclusion: 引入高阶数据相关性有助于提高代码相关任务的效果，HGAdapter方法可灵活插入各种PLMs中增强性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Conclusion: 明确建模法律推理链能够有效增强语言模型的推理能力，LawChain框架在法律分析任务中具有推广价值。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Motivation: 现有遗忘学习方法评估主要关注目标知识的遗忘程度和保留集性能，但忽视了当已遗忘知识在提示中重新出现时模型仍应能利用该知识的上下文效用需求。

Method: 在现有遗忘学习目标基础上添加插件项，专门用于保持模型在提示中包含已遗忘知识时仍能有效利用该知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能将上下文效用恢复到接近原始水平，同时仍保持有效的遗忘效果和保留集效用。

Conclusion: 通过增强遗忘学习目标，可以在保持有效遗忘的同时恢复模型的上下文效用，解决了现有方法的重要局限性。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: This paper introduces Qomhr\'a, a bilingual Irish-English large language
model (LLM), developed under low-resource constraints presenting a complete
pipeline spanning bilingual continued pre-training, instruction tuning, and
alignment from human preferences. Newly accessible Irish corpora and English
text are mixed and curated to improve Irish performance while preserving
English ability. 6 closed-weight LLMs are judged for their Irish text
generation by a native speaker, a learner and other LLMs. Google's
Gemini-2.5-Pro is ranked the highest and is subsequently used to synthesise
instruction tuning and human preference datasets. Two datasets are contributed
leveraging Gemini-2.5-Pro: a 30K Irish-English parallel instruction tuning
dataset and a 1K human preference dataset, generating accepted and rejected
responses that show near perfect alignment with a native Irish speaker.

*Liqun He,Manolis Mavrikis,Mutlu Cukurova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对话分析方法来评估教育应用中LLM的有效性，通过分析学习者与LLM的对话来识别有效的教学策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注技术性能或学习成果，而忽视了学习者与LLM之间的互动过程，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用对话分析方法，包括对话数据收集、对话行为标注、对话模式挖掘和预测模型构建四个步骤。

Result: 目前处于早期研究阶段，已获得初步见解，为未来研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: 强调需要从对话动态和教学策略的角度来评估基于LLM的教育应用。

Abstract: Dialogue plays a crucial role in educational settings, yet existing
evaluation methods for educational applications of large language models (LLMs)
primarily focus on technical performance or learning outcomes, often neglecting
attention to learner-LLM interactions. To narrow this gap, this AIED Doctoral
Consortium paper presents an ongoing study employing a dialogue analysis
approach to identify effective pedagogical strategies from learner-LLM
dialogues. The proposed approach involves dialogue data collection, dialogue
act (DA) annotation, DA pattern mining, and predictive model building. Early
insights are outlined as an initial step toward future research. The work
underscores the need to evaluate LLM-based educational applications by focusing
on dialogue dynamics and pedagogical strategies.

*Hanxu Hu,Xingxing Zhang,Jannis Vamvas,Rico Sennrich,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了QueST框架，通过难度感知图采样和拒绝微调直接优化专用生成器来创建具有挑战性的编程问题，解决了现有竞争性编程数据集规模小的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务上表现出色，但受限于人工标注数据集和缺乏大规模、具有挑战性的编程问题训练数据。现有竞争性编程数据集仅包含数千到数万个问题。

Method: 结合难度感知图采样和难度感知拒绝微调，直接优化专用生成器来创建具有挑战性的编程问题。使用生成的合成编程问题从强教师模型进行蒸馏或对较小模型进行强化学习。

Result: 训练出的生成器在创建具有挑战性的问题方面甚至优于GPT-4o。在Qwen3-8B-base上使用QueST生成的10万个困难问题进行微调后，在LiveCodeBench上超越了原始Qwen3-8B的性能。使用额外的11.2万个示例后，8B模型与更大的DeepSeek-R1-671B性能相当。

Conclusion: 通过QueST生成复杂问题为推进大型语言模型在竞争性编程和推理方面的前沿提供了一种有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

*Nanda Kumar Rengarajan,Jun Yan,Chun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个轻量级少样本命名实体识别框架，通过改进的指令调优模板和保留实体信息的上下文改写数据增强技术，在低资源场景下实现高性能NER


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源场景下NER任务面临的标注数据不足问题，现有零样本和指令调优方法对领域特定实体泛化能力差，且无法有效利用有限数据

Method: 1) 新的指令调优模板，结合先前IT方法原理，利用最新LLM的大上下文窗口；2) 战略性数据增强技术，在改写上下文时保留实体信息，扩展训练数据而不损害语义关系

Result: 在基准数据集上，少样本方法在CrossNER数据集上平均F1得分为80.1；使用改写方法的模型相比基线版本F1分数提升高达17分

Conclusion: 该方法为训练数据和计算能力有限的群体提供了有前景的解决方案，在少样本和零样本任务上达到与最先进模型相当的性能

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AcademicEval，一个基于arXiv论文的实时长文本生成基准测试，包含标题、摘要、引言和相关工作四个学术写作任务，无需人工标注且能避免标签泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长文本LLM基准测试存在上下文长度固定、标注成本高以及在LLM训练中标签泄露的问题，需要开发更有效的评估方法。

Method: 使用arXiv论文构建长文本生成任务，集成专家策划的少样本示例，支持灵活上下文长度，并采用实时评估机制防止标签泄露。

Result: LLMs在具有层次抽象级别的任务上表现不佳，且难以处理长少样本演示，凸显了该基准测试的挑战性。

Conclusion: AcademicEval为评估LLMs的长文本建模能力提供了有效基准，通过实验分析揭示了提升LLMs长文本建模能力的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

*Tong Chen,Akari Asai,Luke Zettlemoyer,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Faeze Brahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，有效减少语言模型的外源性幻觉，在保持其他任务性能的同时显著提升事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少语言模型外源性幻觉时，往往会降低开放生成和下游任务的性能，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习，只有当模型输出完全正确时才给予奖励1，否则为0。

Result: 在开放生成任务中幻觉率降低39.3%；在问答任务中学会策略性弃答，在PopQA和GPQA上分别减少44.4%和21.7%的错误答案；且不影响指令遵循、数学和代码任务性能。

Conclusion: 二元奖励方案在提升事实准确性的同时避免了其他任务性能的退化，优于连续奖励强化学习方法。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学大语言模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，但这些结果转化为临床工作流程中安全可靠的性能仍具挑战性，需要更贴近实际临床使用的评估框架。

Method: 采用自主性层级框架(L0-L3)，涵盖信息工具、信息转换与聚合、决策支持和监督代理，将现有基准和指标与各层级的允许操作和风险对齐。

Result: 提出了基于层级的蓝图，用于选择指标、收集证据和报告声明，并将评估与监管联系起来，使评估目标更加明确。

Conclusion: 通过以自主性为中心，该调查推动领域超越基于分数的声明，转向为真实临床使用提供可信、风险感知的证据。

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FARE（基础自动推理评估器），通过大规模数据驱动的监督微调方法，在2.5M样本上训练了8B和20B参数的评估器，在多个推理评估任务中超越了更大规模的专门评估器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式评估器主要关注新方法如强化学习，而忽视了大规数据驱动开发。本文旨在通过数据扩展来解决这一局限。

Method: 使用简单的迭代拒绝采样监督微调方法，在2.5M样本上训练8B和20B参数的评估器，涵盖五种评估任务和多个推理领域。

Result: FARE-8B挑战了更大的专门RL训练评估器，FARE-20B为开源评估器设定了新标准，超越了专门的70B+评估器。在实际应用中，FARE-20B在MATH上达到接近oracle性能，在RL训练中提升下游模型性能达14.1%。

Conclusion: 大规模数据驱动的监督微调方法可以有效训练高质量的自动推理评估器，FARE系列评估器在多个任务中表现出色，为自动评估提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Motivation: 现有方法在AI研究复现中面临挑战，包括生成可执行代码困难、背景知识不足、RAG方法无法捕捉隐藏技术细节、忽视代码实现信号以及缺乏结构化知识表示等问题。

Method: 设计可执行知识图谱(xKG)，自动从科学文献中提取技术见解、代码片段和领域特定知识，支持多粒度检索和重用，并集成到三个代理框架中。

Conclusion: xKG是一个通用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效支持AI研究的自动化复现，通过结构化知识表示和多粒度检索机制解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的基于草图的烟雾插图生成框架，使用流函数和潜在扩散模型。用户草图指导流函数生成，流函数作为速度场生成器的控制条件，最终引导烟雾模拟与预期流动对齐。

Motivation: 解决草图到烟雾模拟的转换问题，通过流函数捕捉草图中缺失的连续变化和旋转流动细节，使生成的烟雾更符合预期的流动动态。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用用户草图指导流函数生成；第二阶段使用流函数作为控制条件，通过潜在扩散模型生成速度场，进而引导烟雾模拟。训练时使用流线编码全局流动动态作为草图指导。

Result: 开发了一个能够根据用户草图生成符合预期流动的烟雾插图的系统，通过流函数作为中间表示有效捕捉了流动细节。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架成功实现了草图到烟雾模拟的转换，流函数作为中间表示有效弥补了草图在表达连续流动细节方面的不足。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage sketch-based smoke illustration
generation framework using stream function and latent diffusion models (LDM).
The user sketch is used to guide the generation of the stream function, which
serves as the control condition for the velocity field generator. The generated
velocity field can be used to guide the smoke simulation to align with the
intended flow. We adopt streamlines to encode global flow dynamics as sketch
guidance during training. The stream function constitutes the intermediate
representation that captures continuous variation and rotational flow details
absent from sketches.

Abstract: Integrating motion into static images not only enhances visual expressiveness
but also creates a sense of immersion and temporal depth, establishing it as a
longstanding and impactful theme in artistic expression. Fluid elements such as
waterfall, river, and oceans are common features in landscape, but their
complex dynamic characteristics pose significant challenges in modeling and
controlling their motion within visual computing. Physics-based methods are
often used in fluid animation to track particle movement. However, they are
easily affected by boundary conditions. Recently, latent diffusion models have
been applied to video generation tasks, demonstrating impressive capabilities
in producing high-quality and temporally coherent results. However, it is
challenging for the existing methods to animate fluid smooth and temporally
consistent motion. To solve these issues, this paper introduces a framework for
generating landscape videos by animating fluid in still images under the
guidance of motion sketches. We propose a finetuned conditional latent
diffusion model for generating motion field from user-provided sketches, which
are subsequently integrated into a latent video diffusion model via a motion
adapter to precisely control the fluid movement.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应无帧渲染方法，通过闭环反馈采样、时域深度缓冲和GPU重建，显著提高了渲染速度，比传统渲染方法减少了一个数量级的采样数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交互式渲染方法受限于固定的采样模式，无法有效适应时空颜色变化。无帧渲染可以更精细地适应图像中的边缘和运动区域。

Method: 使用闭环反馈指导采样朝向图像边缘或运动区域；时域深度缓冲存储短时间内的所有采样；GPU重建同时考虑采样密度和时空颜色梯度；使用采样重投影改善重建质量。

Result: 在静态场景中产生更清晰且最终抗锯齿的图像，在动态场景中产生更及时但较不清晰的图像；比传统渲染方法减少一个数量级的采样数，额外计算开销仅占15%。

Conclusion: 无帧渲染方法在保持相似视觉质量的同时，显著提高了渲染效率，为交互式渲染提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive form of frameless rendering with the potential to
dramatically increase rendering speed over conventional interactive rendering
approaches. Without the rigid sampling patterns of framed renderers, sampling
and reconstruction can adapt with very fine granularity to spatio-temporal
color change. A sampler uses closed-loop feedback to guide sampling toward
edges or motion in the image. Temporally deep buffers store all the samples
created over a short time interval for use in reconstruction and as sampler
feedback. GPU-based reconstruction responds both to sampling density and
space-time color gradients. Where the displayed scene is static, spatial color
change dominates and older samples are given significant weight in
reconstruction, resulting in sharper and eventually antialiased images. Where
the scene is dynamic, more recent samples are emphasized, resulting in less
sharp but more up-to-date images. We also use sample reprojection to improve
reconstruction and guide sampling toward occlusion edges, undersampled regions,
and specular highlights. In simulation our frameless renderer requires an order
of magnitude fewer samples than traditional rendering of similar visual quality
(as measured by RMS error), while introducing overhead amounting to 15% of
computation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨架化方法通常假设体积解释，而该方法直接在表面操作，确保生成的表示对导航感知的几何分析保持相关。

Method: 首先提取表面图表示作为结构分析基础，然后生成Steiner树连接关键终端点，最后利用视线约束减少冗余并保持必要连接性。

Result: 在两个用例中验证：基于瓦片的程序内容生成结构表示提取，以及自动关卡分析的关键点和结构度量识别。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成简化的连贯表示，支持程序生成、空间推理和地图分析等应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method to extract a hierarchical tree representation
from 3D unorganized polygonal data. The proposed approach first extracts a
graph representation of the surface, which serves as the foundation for
structural analysis. A Steiner tree is then generated to establish an optimized
connection between key terminal points, defined according to
application-specific criteria. The structure can be further refined by
leveraging line-of-sight constraints, reducing redundancy while preserving
essential connectivity. Unlike traditional skeletonization techniques, which
often assume volumetric interpretations, this method operates directly on the
surface, ensuring that the resulting representation remains relevant for
navigation-aware geometric analysis. The method is validated through two use
cases: extracting structural representations from tile-based elements for
procedural content generation, and identifying key points and structural
metrics for automated level analysis. Results demonstrate its ability to
produce simplified, coherent representations, supporting applications in
procedural generation, spatial reasoning, and map analysis.

Motivation: 现有3D场景布局生成大多采用声明式范式，即先由LLM生成对象间约束规范再求解。这种方法表达能力有限，难以处理复杂场景。本文探索指令式范式作为替代方案。

Method: 采用指令式方法，让LLM迭代放置对象，每个对象的位置和朝向基于已放置对象计算。还开发了错误修正机制，在保持原始布局的同时提高场景有效性。

Result: 在强制选择感知研究中，参与者82%和94%的时间偏好本文的指令式方法生成的布局，优于两种声明式方法。同时提出了与人类偏好一致的自评估指标。

Conclusion: 指令式范式相比声明式范式在3D场景布局生成中表现更优，能处理更复杂场景，且生成的布局更受人类偏好。

Abstract: Synthesizing 3D scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions is a
challenging, important, and recently-popular application. One of its critical
subproblems is layout generation: given a set of objects, lay them out to
produce a scene matching the input description. Nearly all recent work adopts a
declarative paradigm for this problem: using an LLM to generate a specification
of constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the
final layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in
which an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and
orientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative
approach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling
a wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the
robustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism
that iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as
possible to the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice
perceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative
approach 82% and 94% of the time when compared against two declarative layout
generation methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for
3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences.

### [291] [Region-Aware Wasserstein Distances of Persistence Diagrams and Merge Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16486)
*Mathieu Pont,Christoph Garth*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对持续性图和合并树的广义Wasserstein距离，通过利用拓扑特征在输入域中的区域信息，提供了比经典Wasserstein距离更具区分性的度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Wasserstein距离在比较拓扑特征时没有充分利用它们在输入域中的区域信息，导致度量不够区分。本文旨在通过考虑极值对齐区域来改进拓扑特征的比较。

Method: 重新定义拓扑特征的比较为极值对齐区域值之间的距离，通过输入参数调整区域属性在距离中的影响。提供两种策略控制计算时间和内存：使用区域子集和压缩区域属性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛实验表明方法高效，平均运行时间在分钟级别。应用包括跟踪时变集合中拓扑特征的演化，以及用于降维和关键阶段检测的距离矩阵计算。

Conclusion: 提出的广义Wasserstein距离比经典方法更具区分性，能够有效跟踪拓扑特征演化并支持集合分析，提供了实用的C++实现。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the Wasserstein distance for both
persistence diagrams and merge trees [20], [66] that takes advantage of the
regions of their topological features in the input domain. Specifically, we
redefine the comparison of topological features as a distance between the
values of their extrema-aligned regions. It results in a more discriminative
metric than the classical Wasserstein distance and generalizes it through an
input parameter adjusting the impact of the region properties in the distance.
We present two strategies to control both computation time and memory storage
of our method by respectively enabling the use of subsets of the regions in the
computation, and by compressing the regions' properties to obtain low-memory
representations. Extensive experiments on openly available ensemble data
demonstrate the efficiency of our method, with running times on the orders of
minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions with two
applications. First, we use the assignments between topological features
provided by our method to track their evolution in time-varying ensembles and
propose the temporal persistence curves to facilitate the understanding of how
these features appear, disappear and change over time. Second, our method
allows to compute a distance matrix of an ensemble that can be used for
dimensionality reduction purposes and visually represent in 2D all its members,
we show that such distance matrices also allow to detect key phases in the
ensemble. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to
reproduce our results.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过简单预滤波去除等值面中的微小干扰组件，以改善医学扫描数据的可视化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从CT扫描或MRI等扫描数据构建的等值面通常包含许多极小的组件，这些组件会分散可视化注意力，且不构成从数据生成的任何几何模型的一部分。

Method: 采用简单的数据预滤波方法，在保持大型组件完整的同时去除微小组件。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效去除等值面中的微小干扰组件。

Conclusion: 简单的预滤波技术可以有效改善等值面可视化效果，去除干扰性微小组件而不影响主要几何结构。

Abstract: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field. An isosurface
is a piecewise linear approximation of a level set $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for some
$\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ built from some regular grid sampling of $f$.
Isosurfaces constructed from scanned data such as CT scans or MRIs often
contain extremely small components that distract from the visualization and do
not form part of any geometric model produced from the data. Simple
prefiltering of the data can remove such small components while having no
effect on the large components that form the body of the visualization. We
present experimental results on such filtering.

TL;DR: SeerX是一个轻量级、可扩展的传输中(in-transit)原位服务，支持动态资源分配和3D模拟数据的有损压缩，使多个模拟能够将分析任务卸载到共享的弹性服务基础设施中，无需MPI同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模拟产生的数据超过超级计算机的磁盘空间，许多模拟采用原位分析和可视化来减少需要存储的数据量。但原位可视化的有效性受到先验知识需求的限制：需要知道可视化参数来突出感兴趣的特征，以及无法提前知道运行原位工作流所需的资源。

Method: 提出了SeerX服务，这是一个轻量级、可扩展的传输中原位服务，支持动态资源分配和3D模拟数据的有损压缩。SeerX使多个模拟能够将分析任务卸载到共享的弹性服务基础设施中，无需MPI同步。

Result: 该方法解决了原位分析中的两个关键挑战：可视化参数选择和资源需求不确定性，通过共享的弹性服务基础设施实现了高效的数据处理。

Conclusion: SeerX为大规模模拟提供了一种有效的原位分析解决方案，通过动态资源分配和共享服务基础设施，克服了传统原位分析方法的局限性。

Abstract: As simulations produce more data than available disk space on supercomputers,
many simulations are employing in situ analysis and visualization to reduce the
amount of data that needs to be stored. While in situ visualization offers
potential for substantial data reduction, its efficacy is hindered by the need
for a priori knowledge. First, we need to know what visualization parameters to
use to highlight features of interest. Second, we do not know ahead of time how
much resources will be needed to run the in situ workflows, e.g. how many
compute nodes will be needed for in situ work. In this work, we present SeerX,
a lightweight, scalable in-transit in situ service that supports dynamic
resource allocation and lossy compression of 3D simulation data. SeerX enables
multiple simulations to offload analysis to a shared, elastic service
infrastructure without MPI synchronization.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SAIP是首个考虑身体形状差异的稀疏惯性运动捕捉方法，通过分解传感器测量中的形状和姿态信息，能够有效处理不同体型（如儿童）的运动捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖标准成人身体模型，难以泛化到体型差异较大的个体（如儿童），因为身体形状变化会影响IMU测量的加速度。

Method: 1. 训练回归模型将真实身体的IMU加速度转换到标准成人模型；2. 使用现有方法估计标准体型身体的完整运动；3. 通过第二个回归模型将关节速度映射回真实身体，结合形状感知的物理优化策略计算全局运动。

Result: 创建了首个包含不同体型个体的IMU运动捕捉数据集（10名儿童和10名成人，身高110-190cm，共400分钟数据），实验证明SAIP能有效处理不同体型的运动捕捉任务。

Conclusion: SAIP通过形状感知的方法成功解决了惯性运动捕捉中的体型泛化问题，为不同体型个体的运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion capture with sparse inertial sensors has gained significant
attention recently. However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a
template adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges
when generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a
child). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration
caused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware
Inertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in
sparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor
measurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their
joint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the
IMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body
model, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can
easily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of
the template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map
the joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware
physical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject.
Furthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first
inertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the
shape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate
the effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset
containing individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10
children and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total
of 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse
body shapes. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lean Finder是一个针对Lean和mathlib的语义搜索引擎，通过理解数学家的意图来改进定理搜索，相比现有方法有30%以上的相对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式定理证明的进展常常因难以找到相关定理和Lean 4语言的学习曲线陡峭而受阻。现有搜索引擎主要依赖非形式化翻译，但忽略了与实际用户查询的不匹配问题。

Method: 首先分析并聚类公共Lean讨论的语义，然后在模拟用户意图的合成查询上微调文本嵌入。通过多种反馈信号与数学家的偏好对齐，从多个角度编码他们的目标。

Result: 在真实世界查询、非形式化语句和证明状态上的评估显示，Lean Finder相比之前的搜索引擎和GPT-4o实现了超过30%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Lean Finder是一个用户中心的语义搜索系统，能够有效理解数学家的搜索意图，并与基于LLM的定理证明器兼容，连接了检索与形式推理。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LS-OGD是一个用于多模态学习的自适应控制框架，通过动态调整学习率和模态融合权重来应对概念漂移，确保系统在漂移条件下的稳定性和容错能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统在非平稳环境中面临概念漂移的挑战，特别是模态特定的漂移和缺乏持续稳定适应机制的问题。

Method: 使用在线控制器动态调整模型学习率和不同数据模态的融合权重，响应检测到的漂移和预测误差变化。

Result: 在有限漂移条件下，LS-OGD系统的预测误差被证明是最终一致有界的，如果漂移停止则收敛到零；自适应融合策略能有效隔离和减轻模态特定漂移的影响。

Conclusion: LS-OGD为开发可靠且持续适应的多模态学习系统提供了理论基础，确保了系统的弹性和容错能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多响应采样能提高LLM输出质量，但会增加计算成本。关键挑战是如何在准确性和效率之间平衡，决定何时停止生成新样本。

Method: 基于顺序搜索和贝叶斯学习，BEACON顺序生成策略LLM的响应，实时更新奖励分布的后验信念，权衡预期收益与计算成本来决定停止时机。

Result: BEACON在保持响应质量的同时，将平均采样量减少了80%，并展示了在成本效益偏好数据生成中的实用性。

Conclusion: BEACON提供了理论最优性保证和实际可操作性，为未来研究者提供了实用的扩展思路和行动指南。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

TL;DR: PatMD是一种新颖的有害表情包检测方法，通过学习和主动缓解潜在的误判风险来提高检测效果，在5个有害检测任务上平均F1分数提升8.30%，准确率提升7.71%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网表情包已成为流行的多模态媒介，但经常被武器化用于通过讽刺、隐喻等微妙修辞手法传达有害观点。现有的检测方法（包括MLLM技术）难以处理这些隐式表达，导致频繁误判。

Method: 构建知识库，将每个表情包解构为误判风险模式，解释其可能被误判的原因（漏判有害潜台词或过度解读良性内容）。对于目标表情包，PatMD检索相关模式并动态指导MLLM的推理。

Result: 在包含6,626个表情包的基准测试中，PatMD在5个有害检测任务上优于最先进的基线方法，平均F1分数提升8.30%，准确率提升7.71%。

Conclusion: PatMD通过识别潜在的误判风险模式并主动指导MLLM避免已知的误判陷阱，显著提高了有害表情包的检测能力，展现出强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于WaveNet的深度学习模型，用于自动分类EEG信号为生理、病理、伪影和噪声四类，在公开数据集上取得了优于CNN和LSTM方法的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖专家视觉审查的EEG信号分类方法在处理日益复杂的EEG记录时变得不切实际，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用WaveNet架构，利用扩张因果卷积和残差连接处理EEG数据，在Mayo Clinic和St. Anne's大学医院的公开数据集上进行训练验证，采用70/20/10的数据分割。

Result: 模型分类准确率超过之前的CNN和LSTM方法，能够高精度区分噪声和伪影，但在生理和病理信号之间存在可解释的误分类，反映了临床固有的重叠性。

Conclusion: WaveNet架构因其能够捕捉细粒度和长程时间依赖性，非常适合EEG数据分析，为EEG信号自动分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Conclusion: 击键动力学可作为帕金森病的可靠数字生物标志物，为早期检测和持续监测提供有前景的途径。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Conclusion: EnSF被确立为野火数据同化的稳健实用方法，相关代码已公开。

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

Motivation: 现实任务自动化需要LLMs调用工具并处理复杂的JSON响应，但LLMs处理结构化响应的能力研究不足。

Method: 创建了工具响应处理数据集，评估15个开源和闭源模型，采用多种提示策略。

Result: JSON处理对前沿模型仍是困难任务，最佳处理策略取决于工具输出的性质和大小以及所需推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: 工具响应处理是LLMs的关键挑战，处理策略选择对性能有显著影响，性能差异可达3%-50%。

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

Motivation: 现有建模方法将调查变量独立处理，忽略了变量间的潜在关联结构，无法有效检测青少年非法药物使用

Method: LAMI将个体响应表示为关系图，通过图结构学习层学习潜在连接，并集成大语言模型生成基于图结构和调查语义的自然语言解释

Result: 在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上的实验表明，LAMI在预测准确性上优于竞争基线方法

Conclusion: LAMI能够揭示有意义的行为子结构和心理社会路径，如家庭动态、同伴影响和学校相关压力，这些与已确立的物质使用风险因素一致

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA是一种基于曲率信任区域的参数高效微调框架，通过秩调度和稳定性感知优化，在多个7B-13B模型上实现了优于现有PEFT方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法虽然通过低秩更新、量化或启发式预算重分配提高效率，但往往将容量分配与训练过程中更新演化分离，缺乏理论指导。

Method: CTR-LoRA基于轻量级二阶代理的边际效用分配参数，并使用Fisher/Hessian度量信任区域约束更新，结合秩调度和稳定性感知优化。

Result: 在多个开源骨干模型(7B-13B)上，在分布内和分布外基准测试中均优于强PEFT基线，提高了准确性、训练稳定性，减少了内存需求并提升了吞吐量。

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA在性能和效率的帕累托前沿上表现出色，为更鲁棒和可部署的PEFT提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调(PEFT)技术虽然广泛使用，但其效率低下带来了时间投入和运营成本的显著挑战，需要新的加速方法。

Method: Long Exposure系统包含三个关键组件：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer使用长感知范围捕获更多稀疏细节；Sequence-oriented Predictor处理大序列输入和动态参数；Dynamic-aware Operator优化计算模式和内存访问。

Result: 广泛评估显示，Long Exposure在端到端微调中实现了最高2.49倍的加速，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLMs的PEFT提供了有前景的进展，有效解决了微调中的Shadowy Sparsity问题。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大型推理模型的死锁攻击方法，通过训练恶意对抗嵌入诱导模型陷入永久推理循环，阻止其输出最终答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型的链式思维推理机制引入了新的安全漏洞，需要研究如何通过资源耗尽攻击来劫持模型的生成控制流。

Method: 使用优化的对抗嵌入鼓励模型在推理步骤后生成过渡性标记（如"Wait"、"But"），并结合后门植入策略通过特定触发标记可靠激活攻击。

Result: 在四个先进LRM和三个数学推理基准测试中实现100%攻击成功率，迫使模型生成达到最大标记限制，同时攻击具有隐蔽性且对现有缓解策略具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型推理模型在推理效率方面存在关键且未被充分探索的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度联邦域自适应方法Gains，用于解决开放环境中新客户端加入带来的知识发现和适应问题，通过编码器-分类器分离架构和抗遗忘机制，在多个数据偏移场景下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习面临新客户端不断加入的开放环境，这带来了两个关键需求：检测新知识（知识发现）和将其整合到全局模型中（知识适应）。现有研究存在粗粒度知识发现、牺牲源域性能和适应效率低等问题。

Method: 将模型分为编码器和分类器，发现编码器提取的特征对域偏移敏感，而分类器参数对类别增量敏感。基于此开发了细粒度知识发现和贡献驱动的聚合技术，以及抗遗忘机制来保护源域性能。

Result: 在三个典型数据偏移场景的多域数据集上的实验结果表明，Gains在源域和目标域客户端的性能上都显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Gains方法通过细粒度的知识发现和自适应机制，有效解决了开放联邦学习环境中的新知识整合问题，同时保持了源域性能的稳定性。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Conclusion: SAU-FNO是先进3D IC热模拟的高效工具，显著减少对高保真数据集的依赖并加速训练。

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Method: 为每种非线性模式分配一个重新表述代理，这些代理被明确指示为其非线性模式推导精确的线性重新表述，然后协调组装出与原始问题等效的求解器就绪线性模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性优化开辟了完全对话式建模管道的路径，能够自动化处理线性化任务。

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

Result: 在广泛实验中，PALE在幻觉检测性能上显著优于竞争基线6.55%。

Conclusion: PALE框架提供了一种无需人工标注的高效幻觉检测方法，具有强泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Conclusion: DAWP框架通过AIDA模块在观测空间中初始化AIWP，有效解决了传统方法对再分析数据的依赖问题，为全球观测预报提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker通过分层元认知推理有效解决了LLM推理训练中的采样效率问题，在数学推理任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: AMiD框架通过统一的α-混合辅助分布方法，有效解决了LLM知识蒸馏中的关键挑战，为后续研究提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

### [319] [Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990)
*Kangqi Ni,Zhen Tan,Zijie Liu,Pingzhi Li,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了GRPO算法在强化学习中的局限性，证明其本质上是一种保守的重新加权方案，无法发现全新解决方案，只能在预训练偏差范围内提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在提升大语言模型推理能力方面应用广泛，但其效果在不同领域表现不一致，有时在数学领域显著提升而在医学领域停滞不前，这引发了对该算法改进推理和泛化能力的条件研究。

Method: 从数据分布角度进行理论分析，证明GRPO是保守的重新加权方案，并通过从头训练transformer进行控制研究，评估在推理深度、输入长度、标记表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: 研究发现GRPO的OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏差一致时出现，而ID任务的收益随着性能饱和而减少，GRPO实际上只是强化了预训练偏差。

Conclusion: GRPO不应被视为通用推理增强器，而是强化预训练偏差的工具，这为开发能扩展模型能力超越预训练起源的算法提供了动机。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业对定制化和成本效益高的LLM需求增长，现有蒸馏框架需要手动干预且难以满足复杂需求。

Method: 自动选择帕累托最优服务器，动态匹配师生模型对，根据任务复杂度调整蒸馏策略以优化云托管。

Result: 在特定麻将推理任务上，学生模型准确率是GPT-4o教师基线的4倍，同时降低延迟和成本且不损失准确率。

Conclusion: Stratos在垂直领域LLM部署中展现出良好前景。

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来监测和量化机器学习系统中的分布偏移问题，并展示了即使很小的KS距离（0.02）也会导致强化学习智能体在交通场景中性能显著下降（旅行时间增加50%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习系统中测试数据分布与训练数据分布发生偏移时导致的预测误差问题，这在AI系统的安全性和可靠性方面尤为关键。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来测量分布偏移，使用KS距离来量化分布偏移及其对AI智能体性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现即使KS距离仅为0.02，也会导致强化学习智能体在单个交叉路口的旅行时间增加约50%，表明分布偏移对AI性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: KS检验和KS距离可以作为实时监测AI智能体性能退化的有价值统计工具，帮助AI系统更有效地应对分布偏移问题。

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Conclusion: 提出的多截止适应策略显著提升了ANaGRAM的性能，理论框架解释了正则化的必要性并扩展了与格林函数理论的联系。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks

with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注静态影响力测量，忽略了数据价值在优化过程中的动态变化特性，特别是在深度模型中。频繁的影响力估计计算负担重，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发层感知在线估计器，仅需损失到输出的梯度，避免参数级和全网络梯度计算，同时保持排序保真度。

Result: 在LLM预训练、微调和图像分类等任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著降低时间和内存成本的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法使动态数据筛选在实践中变得高效且可扩展，为数据为中心的学习提供了实用的动态影响力评估工具。

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

Result: 在真实数据集上的大量实验表明，STAR能够提升现有时间序列基础模型在多变量时间序列异常检测中的性能。

Conclusion: STAR作为一个即插即用模块，能够有效增强时间序列基础模型对状态变量的建模和利用能力，解决了现有方法在处理混合类型变量时的局限性。

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: 决策导向方法比传统方法更有效地支持洪水应急响应决策，通过端到端优化传感器部署和预测模型来提升决策质量。

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决深度强化学习在流体流动控制中训练耗时的问题，通过迁移学习策略来加速高保真度环境下的控制策略学习。

Method: 采用渐进式神经网络架构，并与传统微调策略进行对比，以Kuramoto-Sivashinsky系统为基准，评估从低保真度到高保真度环境的知识转移效果。

Result: PNNs能够稳定保留先前知识并提供一致性能提升，对预训练过拟合具有鲁棒性；而微调虽然能加速收敛，但对预训练时长敏感且容易发生灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 渐进式神经网络为稳健、可扩展和计算高效的流动控制提供了有前景的迁移学习框架，特别适用于源环境和目标环境差异较大的情况。

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

Motivation: 翼型几何优化需要探索多样化的设计，同时使用尽可能少的设计变量来降低优化复杂度。

Method: 从UIUC翼型数据库中选择12个最优基线翼型，通过设计变形方法重构数据库，并在多目标气动优化和强化学习环境中验证性能。

Result: 用12个基线翼型重构了99%的数据库，平均绝对误差低于0.005；在气动优化中实现了更快的收敛和更大的超体积Pareto前沿，发现了具有更高升阻比的新Pareto最优解。

Conclusion: AirDbM在减少设计变量维度的同时保持了优秀的重构精度和优化性能，在机器学习驱动的设计中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

Result: 在两个代码基准测试上，IB-FT显著缓解记忆障碍，提高top-1性能，在更严格的多样本指标下获得更稳定的增益

Conclusion: IB-FT能有效克服LLMs代码生成中的记忆障碍，提升模型泛化能力和性能稳定性

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Conclusion: PolyConFM为聚合物科学提供了一个通用且强大的工具。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

TL;DR: 提出GCQ方法，使用网格状吸引子动态将观测-动作序列压缩为离散表示，实现时空联合压缩和统一世界建模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化方法处理静态输入，需要开发能同时压缩空间和时间信息的序列建模方法，并受神经系统中网格状编码形成的启发

Method: 使用动作条件化码本，码字来自连续吸引子神经网络，基于动作动态选择，实现时空联合压缩

Result: 在多样化任务中验证了GCQ在紧凑编码和下游性能方面的有效性，支持长时程预测、目标导向规划和逆向建模

Conclusion: GCQ既为高效序列建模提供了计算工具，也为神经系统中网格状编码形成提供了理论视角

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

*Mengtao Lv,Ruiqi Zhu,Xinyu Wang,Yun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMS-Quant是一种创新的浮点数量化方法，首次探索非整数位宽量化，通过尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，将LLM量化为FP5.33和FP4.25格式，实现2.8-3.2倍推理加速且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的数十亿甚至万亿参数带来了存储和推理效率瓶颈，浮点数量化虽然能加速推理，但传统方法局限于整数位宽，需要进一步逼近量化最佳点。

Method: 提出两种新技术：1) 尾数位共享 - 将k个量化权重分组共享最低有效尾数位；2) 自适应搜索 - 采用离线优化策略最小化共享带来的精度损失。还实现了高效的CUDA线性核，将内存节省转化为实际延迟降低。

Result: 在大规模数据集和模型上的实验表明，AMS-Quant可将模型量化为FP5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2格式，相比FP16推理分别实现2.8倍和3.2倍的解码加速，精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AMS-Quant首次实现了非整数位宽浮点数量化，通过创新的尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，在保持精度的同时显著提升了LLM推理效率，为模型压缩和加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源渗透和配电网电压波动增加，传统配电网状态估计方法难以应对稀疏测量和大规模网络，需要开发可扩展的鲁棒估计方法。

Method: 使用分层图神经网络，结合电网拓扑和物理特征，利用公开的SMART-DS数据集在数千个母线和多种DER渗透场景下进行训练和评估。

Result: 在综合实验中，该方法比替代数据驱动模型实现了高达2倍的RMSE降低，在仅1%测量覆盖率下仍能保持高精度。

Conclusion: 图神经网络具有为配电网实现可扩展、可复制和数据驱动电压监控的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

Result: 在57、118和2000节点系统上测试，MSE降低约25%，可行性误差减少达3倍，运行时间加速达13倍，在N-1故障下仍保持精度。

Conclusion: 残差学习是连接线性近似和AC可行OPF的实用可扩展桥梁，可实现近实时运行决策。

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Conclusion: 提出的重尾动态定量指标和谱特征收敛信号高度一致，证明随机矩阵理论在监控Transformer训练进程中的实用性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense

Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Conclusion: BPL框架通过双重蒸馏策略成功解决了推荐系统偏差问题，在两种测试环境中都实现了高性能，平衡了长期用户满意度和平台用户行为预测的需求。

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

Conclusion: CONEC-LoRA通过知识整合、随机分类器和辅助网络有效解决了领域增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将平衡传播学习算法扩展到离散和连续复值波系统，在弱耗散状态下有效，适用于多种物理环境，并在激子极化凝聚体中验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法在物理神经网络中难以实现，平衡传播(EP)是替代方案，具有可比的效率和原位训练的潜力。

Method: 扩展EP学习到离散和连续复值波系统，在弱耗散状态下有效，用可训练的局部势能替代节点间连接，在激子极化凝聚体中测试。

Result: 在标准基准测试中（包括逻辑任务和手写数字识别）展示了稳定的收敛性。

Conclusion: 为系统控制仅限于局部参数的物理系统中的原位学习建立了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中由于遮挡、隐私约束和设备故障导致模态缺失，现有方法忽略此问题导致泛化性差

Method: 使用去冗余同质-异质因子化模块分解模态为同质、异质和噪声表示，并设计分布对齐自蒸馏模块进行双向知识转移

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，FSRF在不确定模态缺失情况下相比先前方法具有显著性能优势

Conclusion: FSRF框架能有效缓解MSA任务中的模态缺失问题，提高模型在现实场景中的泛化能力

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STABLE是一个门控持续自编辑框架，通过LoRA参数高效微调来约束顺序更新中的灾难性遗忘，使用三种指标评估编辑稳定性并在阈值超标时进行裁剪或拒绝更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续适应机制而无需完全重新训练，但顺序更新会导致灾难性遗忘，新编辑会降低先前获得的知识。

Method: 使用LoRA进行参数高效微调，通过三种指标（精确匹配下降、比特数增加、KL散度）评估候选编辑的稳定性，超过阈值时对LoRA更新进行裁剪或拒绝。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，门控机制有效缓解遗忘同时保持适应性，基于EM的门控在短持续学习序列中实现了最高的累积性能。

Conclusion: 不同门控策略可以实现可比较的分布偏移，但产生不同的准确性结果，突显了门控设计在持续适应中的重要性，为持续模型编辑提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

Motivation: 上下文学习中增加示例数量能提升性能但带来高昂的内存和计算成本，需要有效的压缩方法来平衡效率与性能。

Method: 提出MemCom层间压缩方法，使用更强的压缩器模型，在每个transformer层进行细粒度压缩，生成软令牌摘要。

Result: 在多个分类任务上，MemCom在所有压缩比下均优于基线方法，高压缩比时性能下降小于10%，而基线方法下降超过20-30%。

Conclusion: MemCom通过层间压缩实现了高效的多示例提示压缩，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Motivation: 探索是否能在顺序决策任务中实现人机互补，通过自适应控制人类代理水平来超越单独使用专家或分类器的性能。

Method: 使用预训练AI代理缩小人类可采取的行动集合，然后让人类从该行动集中选择行动，并引入利用动作集平滑特性的多臂赌博机算法来优化人类代理水平。

Result: 在1600人参与的野火缓解游戏研究中，使用该系统的参与者比单独游戏表现提升约30%，比AI代理表现提升超过2%，尽管AI代理本身显著优于无支持的参与者。

Conclusion: 通过限制行动选择范围的自适应决策支持系统能够在顺序决策任务中有效实现人机互补，显著提升整体决策性能。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

Motivation: 世界模型在强化学习中广泛应用，但传统方法需要训练过程。本文旨在探索无需训练的世界模型构建方法，提高样本效率。

Method: 利用相似性搜索和随机表示来近似世界模型，避免训练过程。与Dreamer家族的PlaNet模型进行对比分析。

Result: 搜索式世界模型在潜在重建质量和感知相似性方面与基于训练的模型相当，在长时程预测方面表现更优，特别是在视觉差异较大的环境中。

Conclusion: 基于搜索的世界模型是训练式模型的有效替代方案，在长时程预测任务中表现突出，为世界模型研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

TL;DR: 首次对时变学习策略下的Q-learning算法进行有限时间分析，证明其具有O(1/ε²)的样本复杂度，与离策略Q-learning匹配但探索能力较弱，同时具有策略收敛到最优策略的利用优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Q-learning分析主要针对离策略设置，而对策略Q-learning（使用时变学习策略）的分析存在挑战，特别是在最小探索假设下的有限时间收敛性分析。

Method: 采用改进方法，利用泊松方程将马尔可夫噪声分解为鞅差项和残差项，并对泊松方程解进行关于Q函数估计和学习策略的敏感性分析。

Result: 建立了𝔼[‖Q_k - Q*‖∞²]的最终迭代收敛率，证明样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)，同时推导了𝔼[‖Q^π_k - Q*‖∞²]的显式速率。

Conclusion: 对策略Q-learning探索能力较弱但具有利用优势，其策略会收敛到最优策略。所开发的分析工具对具有快速时变学习策略的一般强化学习算法分析具有独立价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Motivation: 现有稀疏专家混合模型的专家合并策略缺乏原则性的权重机制，需要更平衡高效的协作方法。

Method: 基于博弈论视角，将专家合并重新解释为合作竞争动态，引入纳什议价机制，并加入复动量加速专家传播。

Result: 在语言建模、文本分类、图像分类和数据损坏下的零样本鲁棒性等任务中，NAMEx始终优于竞争方法，并能无缝集成到流行的MoE架构中。

Conclusion: NAMEx在大规模系统（如Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE）中展现出良好的可扩展性和有效性，适用于零样本和微调场景。

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法优化平滑后的函数期望值，而SAM方法关注邻域内的最大损失以获得平坦最小值。本文旨在连接这两种方法，提供更灵活的优化框架。

Method: 提出指数倾斜目标，通过倾斜参数t在平均损失和最大损失之间平滑过渡，开发新的零阶算法来求解软SAM目标。

Result: 该方法在分类、多项选择问答和语言生成等下游任务中，相比传统零阶基线方法获得了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）已成为语言模型偏好微调的流行方法，但其内部对齐机制仍然不透明，需要系统分析对齐是如何实现的。

Method: 在基础模型和调优模型之间应用层间因果修补，分析人类偏好对中的激活差异，并使用LASSO回归识别与奖励增益相关的关键层。

Result: 对齐在空间上是局部化的：中间层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，只有少数层具有非零系数连接激活距离与奖励增益。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个方向性的低秩过程，而非扩散的参数化过程。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Motivation: 对抗训练作为主要防御策略存在计算成本高和可能损害原始数据准确性的问题，需要探索更高效的架构方法来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种对称感知架构：并行设计（独立处理标准和等变特征后融合）和级联设计（顺序应用等变操作），嵌入旋转和尺度等变卷积层。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和CIFAR-10C数据集上，模型在FGSM和PGD攻击下均表现出更好的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，且理论分析显示降低了假设空间复杂度和更紧的认证鲁棒性边界。

Conclusion: 对称强制架构作为数据增强防御的高效且原则性替代方案具有巨大潜力，能够在不依赖对抗训练的情况下显著提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习研究过度关注展示智能体性能，而忽视了理解学习动态的重要性，这可能导致在学术基准上过拟合，难以将技术迁移到新问题。

Method: 以Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)为例，说明即使被认为是"饱和"的基准，仍可有效用于发展对RL技术的理解。

Result: 论文提出了两个核心观点：RL研究应更注重科学理解而非单纯性能展示；需要更精确地定义基准与数学形式化之间的映射关系。

Conclusion: 强化学习社区需要重新平衡研究方向，将重点从性能竞赛转向对学习动态的深入理解，这样才能更好地将RL技术应用于现实世界问题。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

### [361] [Expressive Reward Synthesis with the Runtime Monitoring Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16185)
*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于运行时监控语言(RML)的新型语言奖励机，能够表达非正则、非马尔可夫奖励函数，解决了传统奖励机表达能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中奖励函数通常被视为黑盒映射，缺乏解释性，且传统奖励机只能表达正则语言，无法处理计数或参数化条件等复杂行为。

Method: 利用RML的内置内存机制，构建语言奖励机，支持非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数规范。

Result: 实验证明该方法在表达能力上优于现有奖励机方法，在事件处理和任务规范方面具有灵活性优势。

Conclusion: 基于RML的语言奖励机扩展了奖励函数的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的非正则行为，为强化学习提供了更好的可解释性和灵活性。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Result: 实证评估表明该方法具有有效性和高效性

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够有效处理结构化和非结构化数据，通过主动学习机制提升了学习性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

Motivation: 研究非平稳老虎机问题，其中奖励同时依赖于动作和潜在状态，且状态动态也受动作影响，导致短期和长期奖励之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用探索-提交算法：探索阶段使用随机Rademacher动作估计线性动态的马尔可夫参数；提交阶段使用估计参数设计优化动作序列以获得长期奖励。

Result: 算法达到$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$遗憾界，解决了时间相关奖励学习和长期奖励优化两个关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作为非平稳老虎机问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过系统识别和优化方法处理了短期与长期奖励的权衡问题。

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集中的标签噪声会影响模型训练和验证效果，但目前缺乏对噪声检测方法的系统性比较和共识。

Method: 将检测方法分解为三个基本组件：标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方法（样本内vs样本外），并提出了统一的基准任务和新的评估指标。

Result: 在视觉和表格数据集上的评估表明，使用样本内信息收集、平均概率聚合和logit边界作为标签一致性函数的组合在大多数场景下取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计新的检测方法和为特定应用选择技术提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

Conclusion: 研究为一比特神经网络压缩提供了理论支持，证明了其可行性和有效性，为资源受限环境下的高效推理提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

Conclusion: WEBSERV提供了一个高效、可扩展的RL网络代理训练环境，显著提升了性能并降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Motivation: AlphaFold等蛋白质结构预测模型中的Evoformer架构深度达48层，计算成本高且层间离散化，希望通过神经ODE实现连续深度建模以降低资源消耗。

Method: 使用神经ODE参数化替代Evoformer的48个离散块，保留核心注意力操作，通过伴随方法实现恒定内存成本，利用自适应ODE求解器平衡运行时间和精度。

Result: 基于神经ODE的Evoformer能生成结构合理的预测，可靠捕捉α-螺旋等二级结构元素，但未能完全复现原始架构精度，仅需单GPU训练17.5小时。

Conclusion: 连续深度模型作为轻量级可解释替代方案在生物分子建模中具有潜力，为高效自适应蛋白质结构预测框架开辟新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Conclusion: S2-DiGCL通过整合复数域和实数域两个互补的空间视角，能够构建更高质量的正负样本，实现更通用和鲁棒的有向图对比学习。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: 记忆化与组合能力之间存在协同效应，这种协同可以帮助模型泛化到未见过的长尾特征组合，模型架构对组合能力有重要影响。

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and

Motivation: 将数据分布的先验信息直接融入Transformer结构，改善传统流模型的优化问题凸性并促进生成样本的稀疏性。

Method: 基于正则化Wasserstein近端算子设计稀疏Transformer架构，该算子具有闭式解且是Transformer的特殊表示。

Result: 在生成建模和贝叶斯逆问题应用中，稀疏Transformer比传统神经ODE方法具有更高精度和更快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 稀疏Transformer架构在理论和实验上都优于传统方法，实现了更准确和高效的分布学习。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

Conclusion: 提出的Input Domain Aware MoE框架通过概率混合模型改进了路由机制，实现了更好的专家专业化和计算平衡，提升了稀疏专家混合模型的性能。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

Motivation: 传统PLS方法难以处理高维异构数据中的复杂非线性关系，特别是在具有高维相关结构的多元系统中。同时，跨多个尺度的交互关系和静态特征加权限制了模型对上下文变化的适应性。

Method: 引入自适应核基注意力机制，分别处理不同的特征组然后进行整合，既能捕捉局部模式又能保持全局关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，与现有最先进方法相比，在多个数据集上性能指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过新颖的架构创新有效提升了预测性能，解决了高维异构数据建模中的关键挑战。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多元时间序列异常通常罕见且无标签，现有方法依赖复杂架构但只能检测异常片段且性能被高估。

Method: 将每个变量的过去序列编码为因果嵌入来联合预测当前时间点并重建输入窗口，使用自注意力机制投影到共享潜在空间捕获空间关系，将投影嵌入对齐到代表正常状态关系的稳定潜在结构，采用基于预测误差和SLS偏差的双重评分机制。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集和评估协议上实现了最先进的结果，同时通过SLS保持可解释性。

Conclusion: OracleAD通过直接定位违反正常数据时间因果性的根因变量，在嵌入级别实现细粒度异常诊断，提供了一种简单有效的异常检测方法。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据集常包含具有复杂依赖关系的高维特征，而内在维度估计面临尺度依赖的挑战：在精细尺度下噪声会膨胀估计值，在粗糙尺度下估计值会稳定到较低的尺度不变值。

Method: 基于连通性因子(CF)这一局部连通性度量，开发了eDCF方法，该方法可扩展且支持并行计算。

Result: 在合成基准测试中与领先估计器表现相当，在中等至高噪声水平和大数据集下表现优异，内在维度精确匹配率可达25.0%，优于MLE的16.7%和TWO-NN的12.5%。还能准确检测决策边界中的分形几何结构。

Conclusion: eDCF方法在内在维度估计方面表现出色，特别适用于分析具有现实结构的数据，能够有效处理噪声和尺度变化问题。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Conclusion: 该工作推动了EEG基础模型的发展，为可扩展和泛化的神经信息处理系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在LLM中依赖标量奖励，丢弃了rollout中的宝贵文本推理信息，导致模型每次都要重新探索，降低了样本效率。

Method: LANPO构建动态经验池，采用奖励无关反思进行样本内自校正，并通过相关抽象从样本间经验中提取可泛化的教训。

Conclusion: LANPO为将历史经验整合到LLM强化学习循环中提供了稳健方法，创造了更有效和数据高效的学习智能体。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时增强（如RAG或工具使用）中模型参数知识与外部检索信息之间的关系，通过将多步推理建模为知识图上的连通性问题，揭示了参数知识密度与增强效率之间的相变现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解测试时增强中模型参数知识与外部检索信息之间的理论关系，特别是确定在少量增强步骤下准确回答问题所需的最小预训练知识量。

Method: 将多步推理建模为知识图上的s-t连通性问题，将模型的预训练参数知识表示为部分且可能有噪声的子图，将增强视为查询真实边来扩充模型知识。

Result: 发现了一个相变现象：当知识图被分割成小连通分量时，通过增强找到路径效率低下，需要Ω(√n)次查询；但当正确知识密度超过阈值形成巨连通分量时，仅需期望常数次查询即可找到路径。

Conclusion: 模型参数知识的结构密度对测试时增强的效率有决定性影响，存在一个临界密度阈值，超过该阈值后增强效率会显著提升。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

*Jiatong Yu,Yinghui He,Anirudh Goyal,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多阶段训练中的机器遗忘面临根本性障碍，局部遗忘方法无法普遍实现重训练等价性，因为遗忘结果依赖于训练阶段的顺序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习流水线通常涉及多阶段训练，每阶段有不同的数据分布和目标。本研究旨在探索这种多阶段训练对机器遗忘的影响。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析，使用梯度上升、NPO和SimNPO等局部遗忘算法，在Llama和Qwen模型上进行实证研究。

Result: 不同训练顺序的模型在遗忘过程中行为出现分歧，GSM8K准确率下降差异超过20%，且某些学习路径产生的模型遗忘速度较慢。

Conclusion: 重训练等价性对于局部遗忘算法是一个不适定的目标，需要重新思考机器遗忘的定义和期望目标。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

TL;DR: StructureFlow是一个新颖的模拟自由方法，能够同时学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动力学，解决了现有方法无法同时处理结构学习和动态建模的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然系统中的物理系统（如细胞生物学）具有高维度和随机性，只能获得部分噪声状态测量，这给建模动态和推断网络结构带来了挑战。现有方法通常只能单独处理结构学习或群体层面的动态建模。

Method: 提出StructureFlow方法，这是一种原则性的模拟自由方法，能够联合学习物理系统的结构和随机群体动力学。该方法支持从干预中进行结构学习，以及条件群体动态的轨迹推断。

Conclusion: StructureFlow是朝着系统行为机制理解的关键一步，能够同时学习系统结构并建模条件群体动态。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

TL;DR: PUMBA是一个基于Vision Mamba架构的蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分函数，通过替换PIsToN中的Vision Transformer为Vision Mamba，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质-蛋白质对接工具依赖强大的评分函数来区分天然和非天然复合物。虽然PIsToN使用Vision Transformer表现良好，但Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域展现出优于Transformer的性能，因此希望利用Mamba的优势来改进蛋白质对接评分。

Method: 将PIsToN中的Vision Transformer主干替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba在长序列建模方面的效率优势来处理图像块序列，从而更好地捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征的全局和局部模式。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的大规模公共数据集上的评估表明，PUMBA在性能上持续优于其基于Transformer的前身PIsToN。

Conclusion: Vision Mamba架构能够有效提升蛋白质-蛋白质对接评分函数的性能，在捕捉界面特征方面表现出色，为药物、疫苗和治疗开发提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

Motivation: 在数据获取成本高昂的领域（如医学成像、环境监测），传统基于强先验的生成模型在数据极其有限或采样成本极高时难以泛化，需要能在无信息先验条件下仍能有效进行主动目标发现的方法。

Method: 提出一个理论原理驱动、受神经科学启发的框架，具有内在可解释性，保证每次新观测都能单调改进先验估计，从而实现越来越准确的采样。

Result: 在物种分布建模和遥感等多个领域的综合实验和消融研究中，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在无信息先验条件下实现有效的主动目标发现，确保在复杂现实场景中的鲁棒探索和适应性。

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为纵向监测开发一个紧凑的严格因果基准，评估不同模型在流式临床时间序列任务中的表现，特别是在心动过速风险预测和心率预测方面的能力。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据库的每秒心率数据，采用记录级非重叠分割。比较GRU-D（RNN）和Transformer在匹配训练预算下的表现，并与强非学习基线对比。评估采用校准感知分类和适当预测方法，包括温度缩放和分组bootstrap置信区间。

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，GRU-D在心动过速风险预测方面略优于Transformer，而Transformer在心率预测误差方面明显低于GRU-D和持续性模型。

Conclusion: 在纵向监测中，模型选择具有任务依赖性：紧凑RNN在短期风险评分方面仍具有竞争力，而紧凑Transformer在点预测方面能带来更清晰的增益。

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Conclusion: 扩散方法为分析噪声SGD提供了精确的连续时间视角，能够更好地理解高维设置中的统计风险和隐私损失动态，同时提出的变体算法避免了梯度敏感度的显式知识需求。

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed

results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating

addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader

This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%

  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and

Motivation: 传统因果效应可识别性定义基于变量层面，但实际应用中我们往往关心特定状态间的因果效应。当变量层面的因果效应不可识别时，状态层面的效应仍可能可识别。

Method: 通过引入上下文特定独立性和条件函数依赖等额外知识，分析状态层面因果效应的可识别性，并研究变量状态约束知识的作用。

Result: 发现状态层面因果效应可识别性与变量层面可识别性存在分离，这种分离仅在有额外知识时才发生。变量状态约束知识本身不能提高可识别性，但与其他知识结合时可同时改善变量和状态层面的可识别性。

Conclusion: 状态层面因果效应可识别性分析能发现传统变量层面框架可能遗漏的可识别情况，有助于从观测数据中估计感兴趣的因果效应。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SegDeformer的联合特征和任务解码方法，显著降低了车载和分布式应用中的计算复杂度，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代汽车系统使用DNN进行语义分割，存在车载和分布式两种应用场景。传统方法使用CNN进行联合源和任务解码，但未研究性能更优但计算复杂度更高的基于transformer的SegDeformer方案。

Method: 为SegDeformer提出联合特征和任务解码方法，在保持性能的同时降低计算复杂度。该方法适用于车载和分布式应用场景。

Result: 在车载应用中，Cityscapes数据集上fps提升11.7倍(1.4到16.5fps)，ADE20K数据集上提升3.5倍(43.3到154.3fps)，同时mIoU与未压缩的transformer基线相当。在分布式应用中，在广泛比特率范围内实现SOTA mIoU，云DNN参数仅使用之前SOTA的0.14%(ADE20K)和0.04%(Cityscapes)。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了车载系统的实时性能，同时为分布式应用提供了高效的云资源利用，实现了计算复杂度和性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMOSA是一种用于开放集主动学习的新方法，通过基于样本典型性的查询策略，有效选择信息丰富的样本，在多个数据集上实现了比现有技术高达3%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习需要大量数据收集，但标注成本高昂。为了减轻这一负担，开放集主动学习方法旨在从未标记数据池中选择信息丰富的样本，这些数据可能包含不相关或未知类别。

Method: 基于理论发现，SAMOSA利用锐度感知最小化(SAM)和随机梯度下降(SGD)的泛化特性，根据样本典型性主动查询样本。该方法能有效识别嵌入流形中靠近模型决策边界的非典型样本。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，SAMOSA在多个数据集上比现有技术实现了高达3%的准确率提升，且没有引入计算开销。

Conclusion: SAMOSA是一种有效的开放集主动学习查询算法，能够优先选择对目标类别高度信息丰富且有助于区分目标类别和不想要类别的样本。

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于3D第一人称视频游戏的多模态推理方法，通过收集大规模游戏数据集、学习逆动力学模型和行为克隆训练，实现了能够响应文本指令的实时游戏智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D第一人称视频游戏为实时多模态推理提供了具有挑战性的环境，需要解决游戏多样性、实时推理和文本指令响应等问题。

Method: 收集大规模人类游戏数据集，学习逆动力学模型来推断缺失的动作，使用行为克隆训练文本条件化智能体，并设计支持实时推理的定制架构。

Result: 训练出的模型能够在多种3D游戏中执行游戏操作，并能响应文本输入指令，在消费级GPU上实现实时推理。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在3D游戏环境中实现多模态推理的可行性，但仍需解决长时程任务和大规模游戏定量评估等挑战。

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD是一种用于分子表示学习的3D图自编码器，通过选择性重掩码解码解决2D到3D掩码图建模的挑战，在MD17基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将2D掩码图建模的成功扩展到3D面临两个冲突挑战：避免2D结构泄漏到解码器，同时为重构重掩码原子提供足够的2D上下文信息。

Method: 提出选择性重掩码解码(SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩码3D相关信息，同时保留2D图结构；结合3D关系变换器编码器和结构无关解码器。

Result: 在广泛使用的MD17分子性质预测基准测试中，8个目标中有7个达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 3D-GSRD通过选择性重掩码解码和结构无关解码器的协同集成，增强了编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

TL;DR: 这篇综述论文系统回顾了大型语言模型的混合精度量化技术，分析了不同精度分配策略在权重、激活和KV缓存上的配置，比较了各种框架的困惑度和零样本任务性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模的快速增长，其计算、内存和能耗需求急剧增加，使得训练和部署变得不可持续。量化作为一种压缩技术可以减小模型大小、缓解内存瓶颈并加速推理，但传统的均匀低比特量化会降低精度。混合精度量化通过选择性分配精度来平衡效率和准确性。

Method: 论文首先回顾量化基础知识，包括均匀和非均匀量化器、量化粒度以及训练后量化方法。然后根据比特分配策略和精度配置对MXPLM框架进行分类比较，分析不同框架在权重、激活和KV缓存上的精度配置差异。

Result: 通过比较分析发现混合精度量化框架在困惑度和零样本任务性能方面存在显著差异，同时揭示了部署时的权衡取舍。与早期深度神经网络混合精度量化方法相比，识别了在语言模型设置下可转移的策略和面临的挑战。

Conclusion: 混合精度量化是解决大型语言模型效率与准确性平衡问题的有前景方向。未来研究方向包括硬件感知设计、激活量化和针对数十亿参数模型的可扩展优化方法。这篇综述为理解当前混合精度量化研究现状和未来前景提供了参考。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

*Weilin Wan,Weizhong Zhang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算预算感知的数据选择方法CADS，通过双层优化框架将计算预算约束整合到数据选择过程中，解决了现有方法忽视计算预算的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法独立于计算预算约束，但实证研究表明不同预算下需要不同的数据数量、质量和分布要求。计算预算应该成为数据选择策略的核心组成部分。

Method: 采用双层优化框架：内层在计算预算约束下训练模型，外层基于模型评估优化数据选择。使用概率重参数化策略和Hessian-free策略梯度估计器解决Hessian矩阵估计问题，将内层优化转化为外层目标中的惩罚项以提高效率。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了高达14.42%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 计算预算应该被整合到数据选择策略中，提出的CADS方法通过双层优化框架有效解决了这一挑战，在多种基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

*Zhoutong Wu,Yuan Zhang,Yiming Dong,Chenheng Zhang,Cong Fang,Kun Yuan,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former是一种Transformer变体，通过从第一层的Value头添加跳跃连接来增强模型表示能力并减少KV缓存，在减少约25% KV缓存的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer扩展需要大量内存和计算成本，特别是自回归解码中的KV缓存。现有方法要么无法减少KV成本，要么以减少表示能力为代价。

Method: 从第二层开始，每层重用第一层一半的Value头，正常计算另一半，从而减少近50%的Value投影和V缓存。

Result: 在不同模型规模下，SkipV1Former能持续减少约25% KV缓存，同时相比标准MHA Transformer和一些先进变体提升困惑度。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former提供了一种有效平衡表示能力和资源使用的方法，并能与现有方法结合实现进一步优化。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么先识别奖励的父节点再应用经典强盗方法，要么在最小化遗憾的同时联合学习父节点。作者质疑这些策略是否最优，并研究遗憾最小化和父节点识别之间的潜在冲突。

Method: 通过证明存在遗憾最小化和父节点识别根本冲突的实例，建立了捕捉动作空间组合结构的遗憾下界，并提出了绕过图恢复和父节点恢复的算法。

Result: 实验证实，在各种环境中，新方法与现有基线之间存在显著的性能差距，表明父节点识别对于遗憾最小化确实是不必要的。

Conclusion: 学习父节点集是次优的，父节点识别对于遗憾最小化是不必要的。新提出的算法在已知和未知父节点集大小的机制下都实现了近乎最优的性能。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

<details>

Motivation: 考古预测建模面临结构性标签稀缺问题：正样本稀少且大多数位置未标记，需要有效方法来处理这种严重类别不平衡。

Method: 采用半监督正未标记学习策略，实现为语义分割模型，使用动态伪标签和通过RNN实现的CRF来增强标签置信度。

Result: 在DEM数据集上与最先进的LAMAP方法性能相当但获得更高的Dice分数；在原始卫星影像上保持性能并产生更具可解释性的预测表面。

Conclusion: 半监督学习为在大型稀疏标注景观中识别未发现遗址提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出线性注意力神经算子（LANO），通过引入少量代理令牌来调解全局交互，在保持软注意力表达能力的同时实现线性复杂度，解决了传统神经算子在可扩展性和准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于transformer的神经算子面临可扩展性-准确性权衡：软注意力计算复杂度高（O(N²d)），而线性注意力变体虽然降低计算成本但准确性显著下降。

Method: 引入紧凑的代理令牌集（M≪N），通过代理注意力机制调解N个令牌之间的全局交互，实现线性复杂度O(MNd)的算子层。

Result: 理论上证明了通用逼近性质，实证上在标准基准测试中比当前最先进的神经PDE求解器（包括Transolver）平均提高19.5%的准确性。

Conclusion: LANO通过在保持软注意力级别性能的同时实现线性复杂度，为科学机器学习应用建立了可扩展、高准确性的基础。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

TL;DR: UDS是一种用于监督微调的高效在线批量选择框架，通过核范数捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，并通过轻量级历史样本缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源即可实现计算高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线批量选择方法存在三个主要问题：(i)仅依赖数据效用而忽略多样性；(ii)需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集；(iii)训练时间超过全数据集训练。UDS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: UDS利用对数矩阵的核范数捕获数据效用和样本内多样性，通过低维嵌入比较与轻量级历史样本缓冲区估计样本间多样性，无需外部资源和额外反向传播。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批量选择方法，并显著减少与全数据集微调相比的训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS提供了一个无需外部资源的高效在线批量选择框架，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TRPINN方法，在Sobolev-Slobodeckij范数H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，这是与H^1(Ω)相关的正确迹空间。通过仅计算半范数的理论必要部分来降低计算成本，并通过避免离散化中的分母评估来增强收敛稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准物理信息神经网络(PINN)在处理高度振荡的Dirichlet边界条件时可能失败，需要更精确的边界损失处理方法来提高收敛性和稳定性。

Method: TRPINN方法在正确的迹空间H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制边界损失，仅计算半范数的理论必要部分，避免分母评估，并利用神经切线核(NTK)分析。

Result: 数值实验显示，在具有高度振荡Dirichlet边界条件的Laplace方程中，TRPINN在标准PINN失败的情况下仍能成功，性能提升1-3个十进制数字。

Conclusion: TRPINN通过精确的H^{1/2}(∂Ω)范数实现了向真实解的H^1(Ω)意义收敛，并证明比标准PINN收敛更快。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用双线性自编码器将表示分解为二次多项式，通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析的潜在表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器依赖输入进行解释，其孤立研究不完整。多项式作为代数原语，无需参考输入即可分析，能够描述从线性概念到复杂流形的结构

Method: 使用双线性自编码器高效地将表示分解为二次多项式，并引入改进以诱导重要性排序、聚类和激活稀疏性

Result: 实现了通过代数特性分析非线性潜在表示的方法

Conclusion: 这是通过代数特性实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的初步步骤

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Method: 采用双分支层次编码器（图神经网络处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入层间双向跨模态注意力机制，并构建共享原型空间与可学习的类特定锚点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ProtoMol在各种分子性质预测任务中始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMol通过原型引导的多模态框架，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了分子图和文本描述的细粒度整合与语义对齐，显著提升了分子性质预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

*Dania Refai,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个组件级的评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的数学优化公式，超越了传统的整体评估方法，通过多个细粒度指标来分析结构性和数值性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法将优化公式视为整体，依赖粗糙的指标如解精度或运行时间，这掩盖了结构或数值错误，需要更精细的评估框架来诊断LLM在优化建模中的表现。

Method: 开发了组件级评估框架，包括决策变量和约束的精确率与召回率、约束和目标函数的均方根误差、基于token使用和延迟的效率指标。评估了GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct和DeepSeek Math在不同复杂度优化问题下的六种提示策略。

Result: GPT-5持续优于其他模型，思维链、自一致性和模块化提示策略最有效。求解器性能主要取决于高约束召回率和低约束RMSE，确保结构正确性和解可靠性。约束精度和决策变量指标起次要作用，简洁输出提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出了NLP到优化建模的三个原则：(i)完整约束覆盖防止违规，(ii)最小化约束RMSE确保求解器级精度，(iii)简洁输出提高计算效率。该框架为LLM在优化建模中的细粒度诊断评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Conclusion: DrivAerStar是首个连接学术机器学习研究与工业CFD实践的数据集，为数据驱动的汽车空气动力学优化设立了新标准，展示了将高保真物理模拟与AI集成到工程领域的范例。

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

Conclusion: MoE结构习惯在知识蒸馏过程中会持续传递，可作为可靠的检测指纹，为LLM知识产权保护提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有持续表示学习方法直接利用预训练特征进行下游任务时，在相似性匹配阶段容易遭受多重共线性问题，且更先进的方法在实时低延迟应用中计算成本过高。

Method: 采用近乎冻结的预训练模型，将参数更新重构为相似性匹配问题，受果蝇嗅觉回路启发设计Fly-CL框架，渐进式解决多重共线性问题。

Conclusion: Fly-CL通过生物启发设计有效解决了持续表示学习中的多重共线性挑战，具有低时间复杂度，适用于实时低延迟应用。

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对大语言模型遗忘过程的隐蔽后门攻击，在正常条件下看似成功遗忘，但当隐藏触发器激活时会恢复遗忘的知识。该攻击利用注意力汇聚现象，将触发器放置在汇聚位置并调整其注意力值，从而增强后门持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源权重LLM的兴起，研究遗忘过程本身是否可能被植入后门，即在正常条件下看似成功遗忘，但在特定触发器激活时恢复遗忘的知识。

Method: 通过将后门触发器放置在LLM中的注意力汇聚位置，并调整其注意力值来增强后门持久性。利用注意力汇聚现象作为后门遗忘的网关。

Result: 实验验证了注意力汇聚引导的后门遗忘方法能够可靠地在后门触发器存在时恢复遗忘的知识，而在触发器缺失时与正常遗忘模型行为无法区分。

Conclusion: 注意力汇聚现象为后门遗忘攻击提供了有效的网关，通过精心设计的触发器放置和注意力值调整，可以创建难以检测的后门遗忘模型。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估LLM通过对话发现和利用用户潜在信息的统一基准，包含三个逐步现实化的场景，结果显示LLM在潜在信息发现方面的表现差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM擅长生成通用文本，但在需要用户特定偏好的场景中，用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大部分信息是潜在的，需要通过对话来推断。

Method: 引入统一基准评估潜在信息发现能力，采用三智能体框架（用户、助手、裁判），包含20问答游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要三个任务。

Result: LLM确实能够通过对话发现潜在信息，但成功率差异很大，从32%到98%不等，取决于任务复杂度、主题和隐藏属性数量。

Conclusion: 有效偏好推断仍然是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿，该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络受限于固定标签空间，而大语言模型难以捕捉图结构，需要一种能够统一结构推理和语义理解的方法来处理未见过的图任务。

Method: 编码器使用可学习对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力机制增强预训练LLM，解码器基于编码表示预测任务答案并重构输入图的自然语言描述。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现节点分类、链接预测、图分类和图回归任务的零样本最先进性能，在跨任务和跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: 图结构与LLM语义的紧密集成能够实现鲁棒、可迁移的图推理能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Conclusion: 该工作显著降低了SE(3)等变模型的使用门槛，促进了分子科学中几何感知神经网络的应用和进一步发展

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the
energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and
consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in
the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for
better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了传统掩码扩散模型的信息丢失问题，通过保留部分预测信息显著提升了语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

*Hongwei Yan,Guanglong Sun,Zhiqi Kang,Yi Zhong,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了领域泛化持续学习(DGCL)新设置，并开发了自适应领域变换(DoT)方法来解决该问题。DoT基于人脑分布式加枢纽理论，分离语义和领域信息，通过自适应变换实现跨领域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能系统需要持续学习新技能并泛化到未见场景。现有持续学习方法假设训练和测试领域相同，在跨领域泛化场景中表现不佳。

Method: DoT方法：基于预训练模型，分离语义和领域相关信息，自适应变换任务表示进行输出对齐，确保平衡和泛化的预测。可作为插件策略应用于现有CL方法。

Result: DoT显著提升了现有CL基线方法在DGCL设置下的性能，支持全参数调优和参数高效调优，验证了其领域泛化知识积累能力和资源效率。

Conclusion: DoT是解决领域泛化持续学习问题的有效方法，能够积累领域泛化知识，实现资源高效的学习。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

TL;DR: SolverLLM是一个无需训练、基于测试时扩展的框架，通过生成数学公式并转换为求解器代码来解决多样化优化问题，采用改进的MCTS策略提升搜索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程导致跨问题类型泛化能力差，或需要昂贵的监督训练。SolverLLM旨在开发无需训练即可解决多样化优化问题的通用框架。

Method: 使用改进的蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)策略：动态扩展用于自适应公式生成、提示反向传播通过结果驱动反馈指导探索、不确定性反向传播将奖励可靠性纳入决策。

Result: 在六个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，SolverLLM优于基于提示和学习的方法，实现了强大的泛化能力且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: SolverLLM证明了测试时扩展策略在解决多样化优化问题上的有效性，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

TL;DR: 提出了一个语言在环框架，使用大语言模型将自然语言反馈转换为标量效用，用于在数值搜索空间上进行贝叶斯优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，反馈对于将复杂、微妙或主观目标转化为可量化的优化目标至关重要。传统方法只能接受受限的反馈格式，需要为每个领域特定问题定制模型。

Method: 使用LLM将各种类型的文本反馈转换为一致的效用信号，并轻松包含灵活的用户先验，无需手动设计核函数，同时保持贝叶斯优化的样本效率和原则性不确定性量化。

Result: 该方法不仅为决策者提供了更自然的接口，而且在反馈受限的情况下优于传统的贝叶斯优化基线和仅使用LLM的优化器。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法结合了LLM的自然语言处理能力和贝叶斯优化的效率优势，为复杂优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Motivation: Layer Normalization和前馈网络Hessian矩阵缺乏理论结果，导致Transformer优化景观研究存在空白。

Method: 推导显式二阶表达式，提出基于泰勒展开的损失差异分析框架，将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构。

Result: 结果推广了先前自注意力分析，估计了每个子层在曲率传播中的作用，并展示了Hessian结构如何影响收敛动态和大型模型性能的实证缩放规律。

Conclusion: 通过将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构，为大规模深度学习优化的理论和实证研究建立了新基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

TL;DR: P-KAN是一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的概率扩展模型，用于时间序列预测，通过样条函数连接和直接参数化预测分布，在卫星流量预测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在时间序列预测中难以有效捕捉非线性和重尾动态，且缺乏不确定性量化能力，特别是在资源受限的卫星通信等场景中需要高效的预测模型。

Method: 用样条基函数连接替代标量权重，直接参数化预测分布（高斯分布和Student-t分布），构建参数高效的P-KAN模型。

Result: P-KAN在多层感知机基准上表现出更高的准确性和校准度，使用更少参数实现更好的效率-风险权衡，高斯变体适合安全关键场景，Student-t变体在稳定需求下效率更高。

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率预测提供了强大框架，特别适用于卫星通信等资源受限领域，不同分布变体可针对不同应用场景提供优化方案。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种样本级别的度量方法来量化后训练过程中的知识遗忘和反向迁移，发现不同后训练阶段对预训练知识的影响存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规模化后训练虽然显著提升了语言模型能力，但其对预训练知识的影响仍不明确，需要更精确的度量方法来理解知识遗忘和反向迁移现象。

Method: 使用样本级别的1->0转换（后训练后从正确变错误）量化遗忘，0->1转换量化反向迁移，并针对多选题基准添加了机会调整变体。

Result: 大规模分析显示：领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低到中度反向迁移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑上产生中到大的反向迁移；模型合并不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用度量标准，有助于开发通用AI系统。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了三种概率深度学习方法（分位数回归神经网络、变分自编码器、扩散模型）在次季节预报中改进地表风速空间不确定性表示的效果，相比传统随机方法能提供更真实的空间不确定性表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 次季节预报通常依赖大尺度大气预测因子，但传统基于模型残差的随机扰动方法无法充分表示空间相关性和物理一致性，需要更复杂的方法来捕捉大尺度预测因子与局地预测变量之间的复杂关系。

Method: 使用ERA5再分析数据训练三种概率方法：直接建模分布分位数的分位数回归神经网络、利用潜在空间采样的变分自编码器、使用迭代去噪的扩散模型，并将这些模型应用于ECMWF次季节后报来回归概率风速集合。

Result: 概率降尺度方法相比简单随机方法提供了更真实的空间不确定性表示，每种概率模型在集合离散度、确定性技能和物理一致性方面都有不同的优势。

Conclusion: 概率降尺度方法可有效增强业务次季节风预报，为可再生能源规划和风险评估提供支持。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会科学中常见中小规模数据集，现有差分隐私线性回归方法主要关注点估计，缺乏不确定性量化和合成数据生成支持，而主流合成数据方法要么适用于离散数据，要么需要大数据集。

Method: 使用高斯差分隐私下的偏差校正估计器，提供渐近置信区间，并通过分箱聚合策略实现合成数据生成，确保在合成数据上的回归与差分隐私回归一致。

Result: 实验表明该方法在准确性上优于现有方法，提供有效置信区间，且生成的合成数据在下游机器学习任务中比现有差分隐私合成数据方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法为社会科学中的中小规模连续数据集提供了有效的差分隐私线性回归解决方案，支持不确定性量化和合成数据生成。

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

TL;DR: 提出MuonBP优化器，通过块周期性正交化减少模型并行训练中的通信开销，在保持训练稳定性的同时提升8%的吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器结合梯度正交化和动量，在语言模型训练中比Adam/AdamW有更好的数据效率，但在模型并行设置中由于额外的通信开销导致吞吐量下降5%-10%。

Method: MuonBP在每个设备上独立对矩阵分片应用正交化，并周期性执行完整正交化以维持训练稳定性。使用两个学习率：一个用于块正交化步骤，一个用于完整正交化步骤。

Result: 在8B模型训练中，使用8路张量并行和ZeRO优化器状态分片，MuonBP相比Muon实现了8%的吞吐量提升，且性能没有下降。

Conclusion: MuonBP方法简单，需要最少的超参数调整，在保持与基线Muon相当的迭代复杂度的同时，提供了与AdamW等坐标方法相当的每迭代吞吐量。

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Motivation: 现实世界多模态数据具有复杂的结构关系，传统方法无法区分多跳邻居并将图视为独立模态，这限制了整体理解能力。

Method: 提出Hop-Diffused Attention通过因果掩码和跳扩散整合多跳结构信息；设计MM-QFormer进行跨模态融合。

Result: 在生成和判别任务上优于更大的视觉语言模型、大语言模型和多模态图基线，平均提升6.93%。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息整合模态内和模态间交互，能够超越将图作为独立模态的方法，提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Motivation: 电路原理图在模拟集成电路设计中至关重要，但现有基于LLM的方法主要依赖SPICE网表等文本表示，缺乏对电路设计师的视觉可解释性。

Method: 集成文本、视觉和符号模态，使用6个模拟子结构示例进行少样本布局，采用视觉思维链策略迭代优化布局和布线，提高原理图的清晰度和对称性。

Conclusion: EEschematic能够有效生成高质量的可编辑电路原理图，为模拟电路设计提供了更好的视觉理解工具。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Motivation: 在共享GPU服务器中服务LLM应用时，主流调度器由于队头阻塞或资源分配过紧，无法保证最坏情况性能，需要设计公平且高效的调度方案。

Method: 设计Justitia调度器，采用三种关键技术：内存中心的服务成本建模、轻量级神经网络进行需求预测、基于虚拟时间的公平排队算法。

Result: 在vLLM上实现Justitia，实验结果表明它能显著提升调度效率同时保持公平性。

Conclusion: Justitia调度器能够有效解决LLM应用在共享GPU服务器中的调度问题，实现公平高效的服务。

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

TL;DR: 提出了PIMMA框架，通过三个阶段的生成式方法解决服务质量退化问题，在非线性边权重函数场景下优于传统方法和机器学习基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法直接处理非线性边权重函数的服务质量退化问题，传统组合优化方法受限，而机器学习方法只能处理小规模网络的线性变体

Method: PIMMA框架包含三个阶段：Forge阶段使用预测路径应力算法生成可行解；Morph阶段训练条件变分自编码器混合模型；Refine阶段使用强化学习在解空间中进行优化

Result: 在合成和真实网络上的实验表明，该方法在非线性成本函数场景下一致优于传统方法和机器学习基线

Conclusion: PIMMA框架能够有效解决服务质量退化问题，特别是在传统方法无法泛化的非线性场景中表现优异

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

TL;DR: 提出DICA框架，通过最大化雅可比矩阵体积来识别非线性混合中的潜在成分，无需辅助信息、成分独立性或雅可比稀疏性假设


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性独立成分分析中潜在成分识别的挑战，特别是在缺乏辅助信号和结构假设的情况下

Method: 引入Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA)框架，采用Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax)准则，利用混合函数雅可比矩阵的凸几何特性

Result: 在合理条件下实现了潜在成分的可识别性，无需依赖辅助信息、潜在成分独立性或雅可比稀疏性假设

Conclusion: 扩展了可识别性分析的范围，为现有方法提供了补充视角

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当后处理指令与模型已学习行为冲突时，模型的推理过程会发生什么变化，特别是关注模型是否会进行动机推理来合理化违反指令的行为。

Method: 在简单设置中调查模型行为，分析模型如何生成看似合理的理由来违反指令，并测试不同规模LLM法官检测动机推理的能力。

Result: 模型会进行系统性动机推理，前沿推理模型能检测到大部分动机推理，但较小的LLM法官可能无法识别部分动机推理，甚至可能被说服认为这种推理是正确的。

Conclusion: 动机推理能力的存在对依赖思维链过程进行模型评估和监督提出了挑战，需要在使用思维链监控时考虑动机推理的影响。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了低精度对数定点训练在保持精度的同时，能显著降低硬件成本和能耗，为未来高效训练硬件设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

Motivation: 当前成功的AI模型（如VLMs、LLMs）缺乏明确的行动概念，无法快速适应新任务。需要开发能够通过交互进行自监督训练的智能体，使其具备快速适应能力。

Method: 将目标作为原子构建块，训练时自动生成目标并练习达成；评估时通过逆强化学习将人类演示解释为最优目标达成行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式智能体的自监督预训练提供了一种有效途径，能够实现快速适应和零样本模仿能力。

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Result: Gram行列式评分保持了多种基于真实数据的可靠性排序，且具有实验无关性，在合成噪声模型、CIFAR-10嵌入和真实就业数据上的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Gram行列式评分是一种有效的数据集可靠性评估方法，能够在不知道真实数据和统计实验细节的情况下准确捕捉数据质量。

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图学习框架，通过专业专家网络检测金融异常，提供内置可解释性，能够识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测器将所有异常统一处理，产生标量分数而不揭示失效机制、风险集中点或干预方式，这种不透明性阻碍了有针对性的监管响应。存在三个未解决的挑战：静态图结构无法适应市场相关性变化；统一检测机制错过跨多时间尺度的类型特定特征；黑盒输出无法提供关于异常机制或其时间演化的可操作指导。

Method: 通过自适应图学习与专业专家网络构建框架：使用带自注意力的BiLSTM捕获多尺度时间依赖；通过跨模态注意力融合时间和空间信息；通过神经多源插值学习动态图；通过应力调制融合自适应平衡学习动态与结构先验；将异常路由到四个机制特定专家；产生双级可解释归因。可解释性在架构中嵌入而非事后应用。

Result: 在100只美国股票（2017-2024）上，实现了92.3%的13个主要事件检测率，领先时间3.8天，比最佳基线高出30.8个百分点。硅谷银行案例研究展示了异常演化追踪：Price-Shock专家权重在关闭期间升至0.39（比基线0.29高33%），一周后达到峰值0.48（比基线高66%），无需标记监督即可自动识别时间机制。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应图学习和机制特定专家网络，成功解决了金融异常检测中的关键挑战，提供了内置可解释性和机制识别能力，显著优于现有方法，为针对性监管响应提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了组合设置下的Hedge算法，证明其在大多数组合问题中是接近最优的，但在某些特定设置下存在次优性，并建立了在线最短路径问题的近最优正则化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Hedge算法在组合设置中的最优性，探索其在各种组合问题（如扩展形式博弈、资源分配、m-集合等）中的表现，并确定其最优性边界。

Method: 通过建立下界证明Hedge的接近最优性，识别特定组合集合（m-集合）展示Hedge的次优性，并利用Hedge的接近最优性为DAG中的在线最短路径问题构建近最优正则化器。

Result: 证明对于任意X⊆{0,1}^d，Hedge是接近最优的（最多相差√log d因子）；在log d≤m≤√d的m-集合中，Hedge确实次优√log d倍；但在在线多任务学习中Hedge是最优的；为DAG在线最短路径问题建立了近最优正则化器。

Conclusion: Hedge在大多数组合设置中接近最优，但在某些特定组合结构下存在次优性，这为理解组合在线学习算法的性能边界提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对具有聚合bandit反馈的表格MDP的BOBW算法，在已知转移概率下实现了随机环境中的O(log T)遗憾和对抗环境中的O(√T)遗憾，并建立了匹配的下界证明最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在聚合bandit反馈模型下的在线学习问题，该模型下学习者只能观察到每个episode的累积损失而非每个状态-动作对的个体损失。现有工作仅关注最坏情况分析，本文旨在开发在随机和对抗环境中都能取得低遗憾的BOBW算法。

Method: 结合了在占用度量上的FTRL、自约束技术以及受在线最短路径问题启发的新损失估计器。对于未知转移概率的情况，还融入了基于置信度的技术。

Result: 在已知转移概率下，算法在随机环境中实现了O(log T)遗憾，在对抗环境中实现了O(√T)遗憾，并建立了匹配的下界证明最优性。同时为最短路径问题提供了首个个体间隙相关的下界。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了首个针对聚合bandit反馈下表格MDP的BOBW算法，在随机和对抗环境中都达到了最优性能，为这一具有挑战性的反馈模型提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer在时间序列建模中取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然不透明。本文旨在通过建立Transformer编码器与图卷积网络的基本等价性来揭示其工作机制。

Method: 通过理论分析证明注意力分布矩阵作为动态邻接矩阵，其与后续变换的组合执行类似于图卷积的计算。提出Fighter架构，去除冗余线性投影并引入多跳图聚合。

Result: 在标准预测基准测试中，Fighter实现了具有竞争力的性能，同时为其预测提供了更清晰的机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器在本质上等同于图卷积网络，这种统一的理论重新解释为时间序列建模提供了显式和可解释的表示，自然表达为图边。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

Conclusion: 矩阵自由能正则化是有效的自编码器正则化方法，能够可靠地产生高斯编码并提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide
range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete
time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control,
where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing
from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

Motivation: 解决分类器自由引导(CFG)方法在提高图像质量和提示对齐性时导致多样性减少的问题，同时避免现有解耦方法需要额外训练辅助模型的开销。

Method: 在推理时使用随机前向传递动态生成劣质预测，将引导重新定义为推理时的自校正过程，无需任何辅助组件。

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance是一种零成本的自引导方法，能够在不使用外部模型的情况下实现图像生成扩散模型的有效引导。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

Result: 经验评估将展示PLDA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD范式使模型能够在部署后自主学习和适应动态环境，PLDA方法为此提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

*Guanjie Cheng,Siyang Liu,Junqin Huang,Xinkui Zhao,Yin Wang,Mengying Zhu,Linghe Kong,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPINE是一个轻量级自适应框架，让终端设备能实时调整差分隐私级别，通过动态风险感知、TD3隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证四个模块，在隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本之间实现动态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘群智感知系统在动态资源受限环境中持续生成和传输用户数据，面临严重隐私威胁。静态差分隐私机制无法适应不断变化的风险（如对抗能力变化、资源约束和任务需求），导致要么噪声过多要么保护不足。

Method: 提出ALPINE框架作为闭环控制系统，包含四个模块：动态风险感知、基于TD3强化学习的隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证。设计了平衡隐私收益、数据效用和能耗成本的奖励函数，指导TD3智能体自适应调整噪声幅度。

Result: 理论分析和真实世界仿真表明，ALPINE能有效缓解推理攻击，同时保持数据效用和控制成本，适用于大规模边缘应用。协作风险模型和预训练的TD3智能体设计为低开销部署。

Conclusion: ALPINE框架通过自适应调整差分隐私级别，在动态边缘环境中实现了隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本之间的有效平衡，为大规模边缘应用提供了实用的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架评估文本属性图(TAG)学习中GNN、RGNN和GraphLLM的鲁棒性，发现模型在文本和结构扰动间存在固有权衡，并提出了SFT-auto框架来提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对图神经网络(GNN)和大语言模型(LLM)在文本属性图(TAG)学习中的鲁棒性评估是零散的，缺乏对文本和结构扰动的系统性研究。

Method: 引入统一框架，在10个数据集上评估GNN、RGNN和GraphLLM在文本、结构和混合扰动下的表现，并提出SFT-auto框架来克服鲁棒性权衡。

Result: 发现模型在文本和结构鲁棒性间存在固有权衡，GNN和RGNN性能高度依赖文本编码器和攻击类型，GraphLLM对训练数据污染特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 为TAG安全研究奠定基础，SFT-auto框架能在单一模型中提供对文本和结构攻击的平衡鲁棒性。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学方法的快速发展超过了标准化验证工具的开发，不同模拟方法之间的客观比较受到评估指标不一致、罕见构象状态采样不足和缺乏可重现基准测试的阻碍。

Method: 使用基于时间延迟独立成分分析(TICA)的加权集合(WE)采样，通过WESTPA工具包实现快速高效的蛋白质构象空间探索。框架包含灵活的传播器接口，支持经典力场和机器学习模型。

Result: 开发了包含9种不同蛋白质的数据集，每个蛋白质在300K下进行了100万MD步骤的模拟。通过经典MD模拟和CGSchNet模型的比较验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该开源平台通过标准化评估协议和实现直接可重现的比较，为分子模拟社区建立了一致、严格的基准测试基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE是一个软硬件协同设计的Transformer加速方案，通过E2Softmax和AILayerNorm分别优化Softmax和LayerNorm操作，在不重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，同时显著提升速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在NLP和CV任务中表现出色，但其实时推理速度和效率受到Softmax和LayerNorm操作低效的限制。现有基于函数逼近的方法实现效率低，且需要重新训练来补偿逼近误差，成本高昂且不便。

Method: 提出SOLE软硬件协同设计方案：E2Softmax使用对数2量化指数函数和对数除法来逼近Softmax；AILayerNorm采用低精度统计计算。两者都实现了低精度计算和低比特位宽存储。

Result: 实验表明SOLE在不重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，相比GPU实现了数量级的速度提升和能耗节省。与现有最先进定制硬件相比，Softmax和LayerNorm分别实现了3.04倍、3.86倍的能效提升和2.82倍、3.32倍的面积效率提升。

Conclusion: SOLE通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了Transformer中Softmax和LayerNorm的效率瓶颈，在不牺牲精度的情况下显著提升了推理性能、能效和面积效率。

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法假设单模态高斯策略和标量值评论家，无法有效处理高风险高回报任务中的多模态动作分布和随机回报问题。

Method: 离散化连续动作空间以近似多模态分布，采用熵正则化探索提高风险但高回报动作的覆盖度，引入双评论家架构进行更准确的离散值分布估计。

Result: 在具有高失败风险的移动和操作基准测试中，该方法优于基线方法，证明了显式建模多模态性和风险的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够扩展到高维动作空间，支持复杂控制领域，为解决高风险高回报任务提供了有效的强化学习框架。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Result: AttEnc在三个数据集上的识别准确率分别为99.3%、99.0%和99.9%，预测时间加快44%-79%，平均减少87.6%模型参数。P-AttEnc在单样本场景下识别准确率为69.8%，对未知驾驶员的分类准确率为65.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在减少模型参数的同时实现了高精度驾驶员识别，并能有效应对数据短缺和未知驾驶员分类问题。

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Conclusion: ADCMs框架为一致性模型提供了自动和自适应的离散化方法，解决了手动离散化方案的局限性，提升了模型的实用性和性能

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a

Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出ControlValve防御机制，通过生成允许的控制流图并强制执行，解决多智能体系统中的控制流劫持攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对齐检查的防御机制（如LlamaFirewall）无法有效抵御控制流劫持攻击，因为安全性和功能性目标存在根本冲突，且对齐定义脆弱、检查器对执行上下文可见性不足。

Method: 提出ControlValve防御机制，包括：(1) 为多智能体系统生成允许的控制流图；(2) 强制执行所有执行必须符合这些控制流图，并为每个智能体调用生成零样本上下文规则。

Result: ControlValve能够有效防御控制流劫持攻击，即使攻击者能够规避基于对齐检查的现有防御机制。

Conclusion: ControlValve基于控制流完整性和最小权限原则，为多智能体系统提供了更有效的安全防御方案，解决了现有对齐检查机制的局限性。

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量数据逐渐耗尽和计算资源边际收益递减，传统通过扩大数据、参数和测试时计算的方法已接近极限，需要从人类和传统AI系统学习实践中获得灵感，构建LLM系统的记忆和持续学习框架。

Method: 设计用户反馈模拟框架和覆盖多领域、多语言、多任务类型的综合基准测试，用于评估LLM系统的持续学习能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有最先进基线方法的有效性和效率远不令人满意。

Conclusion: 该基准测试有望为未来LLM记忆和优化算法的研究铺平道路。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

TL;DR: 该论文将泛化保证扩展到非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布，通过PAC-Bayes框架改进现有边界，并在旋转MNIST数据集上验证理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注紧致群对称性且假设数据分布不变，这在现实应用中很少满足。需要扩展到更一般的非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes框架，改进并收紧现有边界，特别是McAllester的PAC-Bayes边界，证明该方法适用于多种PAC-Bayes边界。

Result: 在非均匀旋转群的旋转MNIST数据集上验证理论，推导出的保证不仅成立，而且优于先前结果。

Conclusion: 对于对称数据，对称模型在超越紧致群和不变分布的更广泛设置中更优，为理解机器学习中的对称性提供了更一般的理论基础。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在可解释性和高性能之间的权衡问题，为需要透明性和能力的受监管领域提供支持。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图神经网络中的表征不变性，探索人工神经网络与人类大脑在不变性机制上的差异，特别是GNNs中存在的过度不变性问题。

Method: 采用模型"metamers"生成技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，获得在模型表示空间中等价但在结构和节点特征上显著不同的图。

Result: 发现在多个经典GNN架构中存在极端的表征不变性，虽然通过模型架构和训练策略的针对性修改可以部分缓解这种过度不变性，但无法从根本上缩小与人类不变性的差距。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前GNNs的独特失败模式，为模型评估提供了补充基准，强调了GNNs在不变性方面与人类认知机制的根本差异。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Result: 在原始环境所用时间的一小部分内达到收敛结果，显著提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: PINNs替代模型能有效解决强化学习在智能电网优化中的样本效率问题，大幅减少训练时间。

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

TL;DR: 提出了DISC方法，利用扩散模型的去噪过程提取多维特征向量来检测和分类OOD数据类型，超越了传统基于标量的OOD检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法仅将分布偏移压缩为单一标量异常分数，无法区分不同类型的OOD数据，限制了OOD数据的上下文理解和利用。

Method: DISC利用扩散模型的迭代去噪过程，在多个噪声水平上提取丰富的多维特征向量来捕捉统计差异。

Result: 在图像和表格数据基准测试中，DISC在OOD检测方面达到或超越了最先进方法，并首次实现了OOD类型的分类能力。

Conclusion: DISC实现了从简单二元OOD检测到更细粒度检测的转变，为OOD数据的上下文理解和利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

Conclusion: 生成AI应被理解为专门化过程的涌现配置，而非内容的直接合成，需要重新定位对生成AI的理解方式。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

TL;DR: TabR1是首个用于表格预测的推理大语言模型，通过多步推理和创新的PRPO强化学习方法，在保持可解释性的同时实现了跨任务的适应性，在少样本和零样本设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格预测方法（如梯度提升决策树）虽然任务内表现优秀，但可解释性有限且跨表迁移能力弱。推理大语言模型具有跨任务适应性和透明推理轨迹的潜力，但尚未在表格数据上充分发挥作用。

Method: 提出TabR1模型，核心是Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO)方法，通过构造每个样本的多个标签保持排列，在排列内和跨排列估计优势，将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号，并编码列排列不变性作为结构先验。

Result: TabR1在全监督微调下达到与强基线相当的性能。在零样本设置下，TabR1接近强基线在32样本设置下的性能。TabR1 (8B)在各种任务上大幅超越更大的LLM，相比DeepSeek-R1 (685B)提升高达53.17%。

Conclusion: PRPO方法能够用有限监督激活LLM的表格预测推理能力，提升少样本和零样本性能以及可解释性，证明了推理LLM在表格预测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机化赌博机算法通常存在高维复杂度问题（如O(d^{3/2}√T)遗憾界），且依赖参数采样，计算效率低且难以扩展到非参数或神经网络模型。

Method: 特征扰动技术：直接在特征输入中注入随机性，而不是随机化未知参数或向奖励添加噪声。这种方法避免了参数采样，计算效率高。

Result: 实现了O(d√T)的最坏情况遗憾界，优于现有随机化算法的O(d^{3/2}√T)遗憾界。计算效率高，能自然扩展到非参数或神经网络模型。

Conclusion: 特征扰动技术不仅超越了现有方法，而且将强大的实际性能与最佳理论保证统一起来，为广义线性赌博机提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的平均奖励离线强化学习方法依赖于严格的假设（如遍历性或MDP的线性性），而弱通信MDP是一个更温和的假设，需要开发新的方法来解决这一限制。

Method: 提出了锚定拟合Q迭代方法，将标准拟合Q迭代与锚定机制相结合，锚定机制可解释为一种权重衰减形式，对于在平均奖励设置中实现有限时间分析至关重要。

Result: 建立了弱通信MDP下平均奖励离线强化学习与函数逼近的首个样本复杂度结果，并将有限时间分析扩展到单轨迹生成数据集而非IID转换的情况。

Conclusion: 锚定机制是实现平均奖励离线强化学习有限时间分析的关键，该方法在更温和的弱通信MDP假设下有效，且适用于单轨迹数据集。

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态神经网络训练中常出现模态过拟合问题，即网络过度依赖某一模态，导致性能不佳，无法充分发挥多模态学习的潜力。

Method: MILES利用训练过程中模态条件利用率的差异，动态调整学习率来平衡各模态的学习速度，实现平衡的多模态学习。

Result: 在四个多模态联合融合任务中，MILES优于七个最先进的基线方法，有效平衡了模态使用，提升了多模态性能并增强了模态编码器。

Conclusion: 平衡多模态学习对提升模型性能具有重要影响，MILES方法能有效解决模态过拟合问题，提升多模态和单模态预测能力。

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

Motivation: 时间序列数据常受缺失值、噪声和异常值等污染，传统深度学习方法需要大量预训练且难以应对分布偏移。

Result: 实现了高恢复性能，对异常值具有鲁棒性，且不依赖高斯噪声假设。

Conclusion: RINS-T为处理复杂现实世界时间序列挑战提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ECG分析方法要么捕捉全局趋势，要么捕捉局部波形特征，但很少能同时在高时间分辨率下分析它们的相互作用。需要一种能桥接全局和局部信号分析的方法。

Method: 引入S4ECG架构，利用结构化状态空间模型进行多周期心律失常分类，通过联合多周期预测来捕捉更长的时间依赖性。

Result: 多周期预测方法比单周期方法在macro-AUROC上提升1.0-11.6%，心房颤动特异性从0.718-0.979提升到0.967-0.998，在分布内和分布外都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了心律失常检测算法向时间感知范式的转变，为ECG解释特别是复杂心律失常如心房颤动和心房扑动的检测开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: 建立了扩散先验与数据集蒸馏目标的理论联系，提供了无需训练的实用框架来提升蒸馏数据集质量。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

TL;DR: 应用可解释AI技术(Grad-CAM和SHAP)解释PhaseNet地震检测模型的决策，并基于SHAP值开发了门控推理方案，在9000个波形测试集上F1分数达到0.98，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络如PhaseNet在地震事件检测中精度高，但其黑盒特性在关键应用中存在担忧，需要提高模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 使用Grad-CAM和SHAP解释PhaseNet模型决策，Grad-CAM可视化网络注意力，SHAP量化特征贡献度，并开发了SHAP门控推理方案结合模型输出和解释性指标。

Result: Grad-CAM显示网络注意力与P波和S波到达时间一致，SHAP确认垂直分量驱动P相拾取而水平分量主导S相拾取。SHAP门控模型在测试集上F1分数0.98(精度0.99，召回率0.97)，优于基线PhaseNet(F1 0.97)，对噪声具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI不仅能解释深度学习模型，还能直接提升其性能，为构建可信的自动化地震检测器提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

Method: 结合多尺度深度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，构建跨状态ECG认证模型CrossStateECG，专门针对静息-运动条件设计。

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the

Motivation: 研究Transformer在未见序列上的组合推理能力，特别是其归因于上下文学习和技能组合的现象。

Method: 使用随机层次模型(RHM)作为概率上下文无关文法生成序列，在序列子集上训练模型，并在四种泛化条件下评估：记忆、分布内泛化、相同规则的分布外泛化以及跨层迁移。

Result: 性能随任务复杂性和上下文示例数量系统提升，分布外任务需要比分布内场景多得多的示例。训练过程中出现层专业化，与泛化性能相关。PCA和注意力模式聚类显示Transformer在专门层中发展出结构化、层次化组织的表示。

Conclusion: Transformer发展出支持组合推理的模块化、可解释机制，其内部算法结构与观察到的行为能力相关联。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 个体间显著差异限制了EEG情绪识别在跨域设置下的泛化能力，需要解决多源适应中的分布异质性建模和语义一致性保持问题。

Method: 集成原型约束与对抗学习，使用MMD动态估计域间偏移并重加权源贡献，通过原型引导条件对齐模块增强伪标签可靠性。

Result: 在SEED和SEED-IV数据集上，跨被试平均准确率达94.86%和79.78%，跨会话达95.12%和83.15%；在FACED数据集上跨被试准确率达82.88%。

Conclusion: DAMSDAN框架通过分布感知的多源域适应有效解决了跨域EEG情绪识别问题，消融实验和可解释性分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用生成对抗网络(GAN)进行地下储层建模的可行性，发现GAN在匹配井数据和地震数据方面存在困难，主要瓶颈在于潜在空间的纠缠特性。通过微调GAN可以改善匹配效果，但仍需进一步评估其稳健性。


<details>

Motivation: 地下决策成本高且不确定性大，获取新数据难以扩展。将地质知识直接嵌入预测模型提供了有价值的替代方案，过程模型可以帮助训练生成模型以提高预测效率。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)训练生成河流沉积物模型，并应用四种反演方法来匹配井和地震数据。通过标签条件化、潜在空间过参数化以及微调GAN来改善潜在空间结构。

Result: 四种反演方法在4、8、20口井的三个测试样本中难以匹配井数据，特别是当井数增加或测试样本与训练数据差异较大时。微调GAN可以显著减少不匹配，达到可接受水平。

Conclusion: GAN已经能够处理地质建模工作流所需的任务，但仍需进一步评估其稳健性，并探索如何最好地利用它们来支持地质解释。

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT：一种0.25M参数的视觉变换器变体，用于区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺水肿和正常肺部，在肺超声视频中实现了最佳分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非心源性炎症模式、间质性肺病和健康肺部的高度视觉变异性，在肺超声视频中区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺水肿和正常肺部具有挑战性。这种异质性使得自动分类变得复杂。

Method: 引入ZACH-ViT（零标记自适应紧凑分层视觉变换器），移除位置嵌入和[CLS]标记，使其完全排列不变。提出ShuffleStrides数据增强（SSDA），在保持解剖有效性的同时置换探头视图序列和帧顺序。

Result: 在380个肺超声视频上评估，ZACH-ViT实现了最高的验证和测试ROC-AUC（0.80和0.79），平衡灵敏度（0.60）和特异性（0.91），而所有竞争模型都崩溃为平凡分类。训练速度比最小ViT快1.35倍，参数少2.5倍。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将架构设计与数据结构对齐可以在小数据医学成像中超越规模。

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但现有的差分隐私计算方法在实践中往往导致比集中式训练更差的隐私-效用权衡，这可能是由于当前DP计算方法在DL中的局限性。

Method: 通过推广现有的矩阵分解结果，将标准DL算法和常见信任模型统一到一个公式中，利用时间噪声相关性分析来获得更紧密的隐私边界。

Result: 提出的MAFALDA-SGD算法在合成和真实世界图上优于现有方法，实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: 基于矩阵分解的DP计算方法能够为现有DP-DL算法提供更紧密的隐私边界，并为开发新算法提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: 该框架为使用局部几何分析指导深度神经网络诊断和设计奠定了基础，提供了改进网络架构和训练稳定性的实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for

extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively
explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Motivation: 经典优化理论保证小步长梯度下降的单调目标函数下降，但神经网络训练常在大步长"稳定性边界"进行，目标函数非单调下降且偏向平坦极小值。本文旨在量化这一现象。

Method: 利用过参数化使全局极小值形成黎曼流形，将GD动态分解为平行和正交于流形的分量。平行分量对应黎曼梯度下降，正交分量是分岔动力系统。

Result: 识别了三种收敛状态：(a)亚临界状态：有限时间内克服瞬时不稳定性，线性收敛到次优平坦全局极小值；(b)临界状态：不稳定性持续存在，以幂律收敛到最优平坦全局极小值；(c)超临界状态：不稳定性持续存在，线性收敛到周期为二的轨道。

Conclusion: 通过过参数化最小二乘设置，为梯度下降在大学习率下的收敛行为提供了理论分析框架，解释了"稳定性边界"现象中的非单调收敛和偏向平坦极小值的特性。

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

TL;DR: 提出CD-GTMLL框架，将多标签学习建模为合作博弈，通过好奇心奖励机制解决长尾不平衡问题，在稀有标签上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中存在严重的长尾不平衡问题：少数头部标签主导梯度信号，而许多在实践中重要的稀有标签被忽略。

Method: 将标签空间分配给多个合作玩家，这些玩家共享全局准确度收益，同时获得与标签稀有度和玩家间分歧相关的额外好奇心奖励，无需手动调整类别权重。

Result: 在常规基准和三个超大规模数据集上的实验显示，相比最强基线实现了+4.3%的Rare-F1和+1.6%的P@3提升，并观察到标签分工和稀有类别更快速达成共识的现象。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL为多标签预测中的长尾鲁棒性提供了一种原则性、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD)框架，通过生成多样反事实样本来解决深度学习中虚假相关性问题，无需组标签且能扩展到多混淆变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到虚假相关性的影响，现有方法如DFR依赖显式组标签且在小样本情况下效果不佳，特别是在多虚假相关性导致数据碎片化时性能急剧下降。

Method: CFKD通过生成多样反事实样本，让人类标注者有效探索和修正模型决策边界，通过知识蒸馏步骤不仅重采样欠表示组，还为其丰富新数据点。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证了CFKD的有效性，特别是在低数据量且虚假相关性明显的场景下表现优异，实现了跨组的平衡泛化。

Conclusion: CFKD无需混淆变量标签，能有效处理多混淆变量问题，在存在显著虚假相关性的低数据量场景下表现突出，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

*Wei Huang,Andi Han,Yujin Song,Yilan Chen,Denny Wu,Difan Zou,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在低信噪比(SNR)数据中，通过向梯度下降添加标签噪声可以抑制噪声记忆化，改善神经网络泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易过拟合训练集中的噪声，特别是在低SNR情况下，这会导致泛化性能下降。受标签噪声提供隐式正则化的启发，研究是否在梯度更新中引入标签噪声能提升神经网络在低SNR环境下的测试性能

Method: 在理想化的信号-噪声数据设置中，使用带标签噪声的梯度下降算法训练两层神经网络

Result: 标签噪声GD能抑制噪声记忆化，防止其主导学习过程，实现快速信号增长同时控制过拟合，从而在低SNR下获得良好泛化性能

Conclusion: 与标准GD相比，在梯度训练中引入标签噪声能有效防止过拟合噪声，在低SNR环境下显著提升神经网络泛化能力

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共形对齐的级联机制(CAb)，用于边缘-云模型级联系统，确保边缘预测集满足云模型级别的条件覆盖保证，同时减少向云端的卸载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘智能虽然能通过紧凑的本地模型实现低延迟推理，但保证可靠性仍然具有挑战性。需要确保边缘预测集在条件覆盖方面能达到云模型的水平。

Method: 将边缘到云端的升级建模为多重假设检验问题，采用共形对齐方法选择哪些输入可以在边缘安全处理，从而保证边缘决策满足云级条件覆盖的统计保证。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类和TeleQnA问答基准测试中，CAb级联方法在保持目标条件覆盖的同时，显著减少了向云端的卸载，预测集大小仅有适度增加。

Conclusion: CAb级联机制能够在边缘预测中维持目标条件覆盖，同时有效控制向云端的卸载率，为边缘智能系统提供了可靠的统计保证。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

TL;DR: TrajMamba是一种用于车辆GPS轨迹学习的新方法，通过联合建模GPS和道路视角来捕获移动模式，集成旅行目的到嵌入中，并通过知识蒸馏减少轨迹冗余，在效率和准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆GPS轨迹包含有价值的旅行语义（移动模式和旅行目的），但面临两个主要挑战：旅行目的与道路和POI功能相关，文本信息处理计算负担重；真实轨迹包含冗余点，影响计算效率和嵌入质量。

Method: 提出TrajMamba方法，包括Traj-Mamba编码器联合建模GPS和道路视角，旅行目的感知预训练将旅行目的集成到嵌入中，知识蒸馏预训练通过可学习掩码生成器识别关键轨迹点并压缩轨迹嵌入。

Conclusion: TrajMamba能够有效且高效地学习车辆轨迹的语义信息，解决了轨迹数据建模中的计算负担和冗余问题，为轨迹数据的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列中的未检测异常可能引发安全关键系统的灾难性故障，现有检测方法的性能评估不清晰，因为当前指标仅捕捉任务的狭窄方面且常产生误导性结果。

Method: 引入可验证属性来形式化评估时间序列异常检测的基本要求，构建理论框架支持原则性评估和可靠比较，分析37个广泛使用的指标，并提出新的LARM和ALARM指标。

Result: 分析显示大多数现有指标仅满足少数属性，没有一个满足所有属性，这解释了先前结果的持续不一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的LARM和ALARM指标能够满足所有评估属性，填补了现有评估指标的不足，为时间序列异常检测提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了安全强化学习中拉格朗日乘子的最优性和稳定性，发现自动更新乘子能恢复甚至超过最优性能，但存在振荡行为，可通过PID控制缓解但需仔细调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，拉格朗日方法是解决约束优化问题的常用方法，但其效果严重依赖于拉格朗日乘子λ的选择。目前缺乏关于自动更新乘子鲁棒性及其对性能影响的实证证据。

Method: 通过分析一系列任务中拉格朗日乘子的最优性和稳定性，提供λ-剖面来可视化回报与约束成本之间的权衡，并研究自动乘子更新和PID控制更新的效果。

Result: λ-剖面显示λ具有高度敏感性且缺乏选择最优值λ*的通用直觉。自动乘子更新能够恢复甚至超过λ*处的性能，但存在训练期间的振荡行为。PID控制可缓解振荡但需要仔细调参。

Conclusion: 拉格朗日乘子在安全强化学习中具有高度敏感性，自动更新虽然有效但存在稳定性问题，需要进一步研究稳定化方法。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过降维进一步压缩抗菌肽设计空间的方法，探讨了如何提高潜在空间的可解释性和组织效率，以优化抗菌活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗菌肽是治疗细菌感染的有前途疗法，但序列空间巨大导致设计困难。现有深度生成模型缺乏可解释性，且对潜在空间质量的量化不足。

Method: 使用变分自编码器等深度生成模型，通过降维技术进一步压缩设计空间，并用物理化学性质组织潜在空间。

Result: 发现当数据可用时，用更相关信息组织空间的降维方法具有优势；降维搜索空间更易解释；即使在不同标签可用性下也能用不同物理化学性质组织潜在空间。

Conclusion: 通过降维压缩设计空间并结合物理化学性质组织，可以提高抗菌肽设计的优化效率和可解释性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CEPerFed方法，通过客户端历史风险梯度和历史平均梯度协调本地与全局优化，并使用分层SVD策略减少通信开销，解决多脉冲MRI分类中的联邦学习数据异构性和通信效率问题。


<details>

Motivation: 多脉冲MRI在阿尔茨海默病诊断等临床实践中广泛应用，但训练鲁棒模型需要来自不同医疗机构的大量多样化数据，同时需保护隐私防止原始数据共享。联邦学习虽可行，但面临数据异构性导致的模型收敛问题和大量参数传输带来的通信开销挑战。

Method: CEPerFed方法：1) 使用客户端历史风险梯度加权其他客户端贡献，增强本地更新可靠性；2) 使用历史平均梯度确保本地更新与全局优化方向一致；3) 采用分层SVD策略仅传输模型更新所需的关键信息。

Result: 在五个分类任务上的实验证明了CEPerFed方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CEPerFed通过协调本地与全局优化以及减少通信开销，成功解决了联邦学习在多脉冲MRI分类中的数据异构性和通信效率问题。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习和深度学习技术（特别是GAN）生成合成数据来解决自杀预测中的极端类别不平衡问题，在真实测试数据上取得了良好的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀预测是预防的关键，但真实数据中阳性样本稀少导致极端类别不平衡，需要数据增强来改善模型性能。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机）和深度学习技术（生成对抗网络）生成合成数据样本来增强数据集。

Result: 在真实测试数据上，逻辑回归的加权精度0.99、召回率0.85、F1分数0.91；随机森林分别为0.98、0.99、0.99；支持向量机分别为0.99、0.76、0.86。逻辑回归和SVM正确识别了自杀尝试案例（敏感度1.0），但有一定误报。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了模型的有效性，GAN在生成合成数据以支持自杀预防建模工作中发挥了关键作用。

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

Conclusion: 建立了一个实用且资源高效的框架，使基础模型能够适应特定用户需求，无需昂贵的完整模型微调。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Conclusion: 论文成功建立了策略梯度与动态规划的新联系，为风险规避强化学习提供了理论保证和实用算法，解决了模型不确定性和风险敏感决策的关键问题。

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过直接基于真实世界性能优化模拟器参数，为解决Sim2Real性能差距问题提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提高黑盒LLMs作为分类器的操作粒度，使其更适合需要特定指标约束的应用场景。

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了物理信息神经网络(PINN)策略，将海冰物理知识集成到机器学习模型中，改进了北极海冰速度和浓度的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于北极海冰进入新阶段，冰层变薄且融化加速，纯粹数据驱动的机器学习模型在泛化性和物理一致性方面存在局限，无法充分代表未来动态变化的海冰条件。

Method: 基于分层信息共享U-net架构，结合物理损失函数和激活函数，开发物理信息神经网络模型来生成物理上合理的海冰速度和浓度输出。

Result: PINN模型在海冰速度和浓度的日预测中优于纯数据驱动模型，即使使用少量样本训练也能表现良好，特别是在融化和早期冻结季节以及快速移动冰区显著改善了海冰浓度预测。

Conclusion: 物理信息神经网络方法能够有效整合物理知识，提高海冰预测模型的准确性和物理一致性，特别是在数据稀缺或海冰条件快速变化的情况下。

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Conclusion: 基于图册的方法在流形学习方面具有有效性和潜力，为直接在高维数据流形上进行机器学习提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配方法在推理时缩放方面研究不足，现有方法使用非线性插值会牺牲流匹配的高效采样特性，且仅应用于视觉任务

Method: 开发了保持线性插值的推理时缩放程序，在采样过程中不改变线性插值器

Result: 在图像生成和蛋白质生成任务中，样本质量随推理计算增加而持续改善，证明了流匹配推理时缩放可应用于科学领域

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功实现了流匹配的推理时缩放，保持了高效采样特性，并首次将其扩展到科学领域如蛋白质生成

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代概率回归器在分布偏移下往往过于自信，需要一种能够自适应输入不确定性并保持良好校准的方法。

Method: 使用输入条件化的网络权重分布，通过beta-ELBO损失函数和蒙特卡洛采样进行训练，生成预测混合分布。

Result: 在标准回归任务中，与贝叶斯、集成、dropout和超网络基线相比，在匹配参数和更新预算下，FDN在准确性、校准性和分布偏移感知方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架和评估协议旨在使面向分布外、良好校准的神经回归变得实用和模块化。

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无偏的低秩优化方法GUM，结合GaLore的梯度低秩投影和Muon算法的层间采样技术，在保持内存效率的同时提供收敛保证，并在LLM微调和预训练中表现优于GaLore和全参数训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有低秩优化方法（如GaLore）缺乏收敛保证的问题，这些方法由于低秩投影引入的偏差导致性能与全参数训练存在差距。

Method: 采用层间采样技术来消除低秩投影机制的偏差，基于GaLore机制和Muon算法开发了GUM方法。

Result: 理论证明GUM与基础Muon算法具有相同的收敛保证，同时保持低秩技术的内存效率。实证实验显示在LLM微调和预训练中优于GaLore，甚至超过全参数训练。

Conclusion: GUM方法通过更均匀的层内知识分布，实现了模型参数空间更高效的利用和更好的记忆能力，为内存高效的大语言模型训练提供了有理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索实现多模态安全对齐的框架，旨在解决大型视觉语言模型在跨模态攻击下的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对多模态越狱攻击存在脆弱性，视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，模态融合时安全对齐效果下降。

Method: 通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，引入基于提示的缩放实现实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 实验表明VisuoAlign能主动暴露风险，实现全面的数据集生成，并显著提升LVLMs对复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的挑战，为大型视觉语言模型提供了更强的安全防护能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

TL;DR: 本文提出了结构化认知循环（SCL）作为可执行的认知框架，旨在解决大语言模型缺乏真正认知理解的问题。SCL将哲学见解转化为可计算结构，重新定义智能为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出智能但缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI研究关注"什么是智能"的本体论问题，而SCL关注"在什么条件下认知涌现"的认知论问题。

Method: 基于心智哲学和认知现象学，结合过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，SCL将智能定义为执行过程而非属性——包含判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环。

Result: SCL实现了三个贡献：将哲学见解操作化为可计算结构；证明认知架构中的功能分离比单一提示系统产生更一致和可解释的行为；重新定义智能为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力。

Conclusion: SCL框架对心智哲学、认识论和AI产生重要影响：使认知理论能够被实施和测试；将行为建立在认知结构而非统计规律上；将知识视为在现象学一致循环中的持续重建。真正的进步需要实现认知原则的结构化架构，而非更大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader

Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，且忽视了记忆的建构性和任务导向作用。受皮亚杰认知发展理论启发，需要开发一个更实用、心理启发的统一记忆系统。

Method: 提出PISA系统，包含三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演化和图式创建）来保持连贯组织并支持灵活记忆更新，并设计了结合符号推理和神经检索的混合记忆访问架构。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA数据分析任务基准上的实证评估表明，PISA在适应性和长期知识保持方面创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PISA通过将记忆视为建构性和适应性过程，成功解决了现有记忆系统的局限性，为AI代理提供了更有效的记忆管理方案。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型在解决复杂谜题时性能崩溃的原因，特别是验证是否由于模型需要自行跟踪状态空间导致的评估混淆。

Method: 为大型语言模型提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许模型通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察结果状态空间，并重新提示自己进行下一步移动。

Result: 环境接口的访问并不能延迟或消除性能崩溃。模型参数化策略分析显示与最优策略和均匀随机策略的差异增加，表明模型在每种复杂度级别都表现出模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 模型性能取决于其模式是否反映问题的正确解决方案，类似现象可能在大型推理模型中也存在。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

Motivation: 受人类认知负荷理论启发，为深度学习模型开发中层可解释性框架，以理解模型内部推理过程中的资源分配动态

Method: 将CLTs定义为三组分随机过程（内在负荷、外在负荷、关联负荷），通过注意力熵、KV缓存未命中率、表征分散度和解码稳定性等可测量代理进行实例化，提出符号化公式和可视化方法（负荷曲线、单纯形图）

Conclusion: CLTs为深度学习模型提供了有效的可解释性分析框架，能够深入理解推理动态并指导效率优化

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

Motivation: 解决现有证明自动形式化方法在保持语义含义和逻辑结构方面的不足，将结构保真度作为主要目标。

Method: 首先构建有向无环图映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 在184个本科水平问题的基准测试中，ProofFlow实现了0.545的ProofScore，显著优于完整证明形式化（0.123）和步骤证明形式化（0.072）等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow为证明自动形式化设立了新的最先进水平，其流水线、基准和评分指标已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

### [527] [A Non-overlap-based Conflict Measure for Random Permutation Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16001)
*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集(RFS)和D-S理论(DST)两个角度分析置换间的冲突，并引入基于秩偏重叠(RBO)的不一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是处理包含顺序信息的不确定性的新形式，但如何度量由置换质量函数表示的两个证据之间的冲突仍是紧急研究课题。

Method: 从置换观察出发，基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，进一步提出基于非重叠的RPS冲突度量方法，将RPS理论视为DST的扩展。

Result: 数值示例验证了所提冲突度量的行为和特性，该方法具有自然的顶部加权特性，能有效从DST视角度量RPS间的冲突。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅具有顶部加权特性，能有效度量RPS间的冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

TL;DR: PAINT是一种架构无关的并行时间神经网络方法，用于从测量数据中建模动态系统，能够保持轨迹跟踪并实现高保真状态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经孪生体作为神经代理的演进，旨在创建真实系统的数字副本，需要能够在测试时根据测量更新状态以实现上下文特定的决策，关键在于保持轨迹跟踪能力。

Method: PAINT训练生成神经网络来并行建模时间上的状态分布，在测试时通过滑动窗口方式从测量数据预测状态。

Result: 理论分析表明PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪，而自回归模型通常不能。在二维湍流流体动力学问题上的实验验证了PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪并从稀疏测量中高保真预测系统状态。

Conclusion: PAINT具有开发能够保持轨迹跟踪的神经孪生体的潜力，能够实现更准确的状态估计和决策制定。

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ISGFAN框架解决噪声环境下跨域故障诊断问题，通过信息分离和全局-局部对抗学习提升鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移故障诊断方法假设数据干净或领域相似，但在工业环境中噪声干扰和领域偏移同时存在，限制了方法有效性

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失解耦领域不变故障表示；采用全局-局部域对抗方案约束模型的条件和边缘分布

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有方法

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声条件下的跨域故障诊断中表现出优越性

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

*Ioan Hedea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合离线约束规划优化与在线时序网络执行的混合方法，为柔性作业车间调度问题创建在不确定性下仍可行的调度方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要在应对随机任务持续时间的同时满足严格的交付期限，传统确定性调度在现实偏离名义计划时会失效，导致昂贵的紧急修复。

Method: 首先构建柔性作业车间的约束规划模型，插入最优缓冲Δ*获得完全主动基线，然后将计划转换为带不确定性的简单时序网络并验证动态可控性。

Result: 在Kacem 1-4基准测试套件上的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法消除了100%的期限违规，同时仅增加3-5%的制造周期开销，CP求解时间和STNU检查在中等规模实例中保持亚秒级。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了时序网络推理如何弥合主动缓冲与动态鲁棒性之间的差距，使工业向真正的数字化、自校正工厂迈进了一步。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了LLM生成的临床思维链的可靠性，发现选择性少样本策略显著优于其他策略，关键在于提示策略的质量而非示例数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量临床思维链数据稀缺问题，验证LLM生成医疗数据的可靠性，探索提升生成质量的提示策略。

Method: 在辅助生殖技术领域进行盲法比较研究，由资深临床医生评估三种策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本和选择性少样本，并与GPT-4o的评估结果对比。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上显著优于其他策略，随机少样本相比零样本无显著改进，AI评估器未能识别关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 临床思维链的可靠性取决于策略性提示设计而非示例数量，提出'双重原则'框架作为生成可信数据的基础方法，确认人类专家在高风险临床AI评估中的不可替代作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在企业决策中日益重要，传统基于人类代理人的公司犯罪意图认定假设面临挑战，需要重新定义企业知识的概念以适应算法时代。

Method: 开发了一个形式化模型，通过整合计算成本和统计验证错误率来定义连续的组织知识度量S_S(φ)，并推导出知识谓词K_S和企业范围认知能力指数K_{S,t}。

Result: 建立了定量指标与法律标准（实际知识、推定知识、故意忽视和鲁莽）之间的操作映射，提供了可测量和可司法审计的证据。

Conclusion: 该研究为在算法时代使公司思维变得可追踪和可问责提供了路径，创建了可测量的审计证据。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

Motivation: PHI去标识化对于临床笔记的安全重用至关重要，但传统评估方法依赖成本高昂的小规模专家标注，限制了模型比较和选择。

Method: 部署多个评估智能体独立判断PHI提取正确性，通过基于LLM的多数投票机制整合不同评估者观点，生成稳定可复现的排名。

Result: 在真实临床笔记语料上的实验表明，TEAM-PHI产生一致准确的排名，尽管个体评估者存在差异，但LLM投票能可靠地收敛到相同的最佳系统。

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI通过结合独立评估智能体和LLM多数投票，为PHI去标识化提供了实用、安全且成本效益高的自动评估和最佳模型选择方案。

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

Result: 建立了一个应对AI信息集中化风险的理论框架，为保护数字弱势群体和多元叙事提供了概念基础。

Conclusion: 需要建立'被记住权'机制来平衡AI技术发展，防止数字存在有限的群体被逐渐抹除，维护集体记忆的完整性。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

Motivation: 随着大型推理模型在数学和编程等复杂任务上表现出色，作者发现这些模型存在一个关键漏洞——容易被提示中嵌入的无关复杂任务干扰，从而偏离主要目标。

Method: 通过跨多种模型和基准的综合研究，识别推理分心漏洞；提出结合监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练防御方法，使用合成对抗数据进行训练。

Result: 研究表明即使最先进的大型推理模型也高度易受攻击，注入的干扰物可使任务准确性降低高达60%；某些对齐技术会放大此弱点；模型可能表现出隐蔽服从行为。

Conclusion: 推理分心是大型推理模型可靠性的独特且紧迫威胁，提出的防御方法为提高推理系统的安全性和可信度提供了实际步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Method: 将端到端延迟分解为LLM API延迟和网络环境延迟，通过15个模型和5个提供商的实证研究，提出SpecCache缓存框架结合推测执行来优化网络环境开销。

Result: 网络环境延迟可占整体延迟的53.7%，SpecCache相比随机缓存策略提升缓存命中率58倍，降低网络环境开销3.2倍，且不损害系统性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

Motivation: 当前多跳推理方法要么使用LLM进行事实验证（擅长并行验证但链式推理差），要么使用KG路径构建（擅长链式推理但并行验证效率低），这些限制影响了多跳问答的效率和准确性。

Method: 提出双轨KG验证和推理框架DTKG，受认知科学中的双过程理论启发，包含分类阶段和分支处理阶段两个主要阶段。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: DTKG框架通过结合两种方法的优势，旨在提高多跳推理问答任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Conclusion: MedRule-KG为安全的数学推理提供了通用框架，通过知识图谱和符号验证确保推理的数学一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

### [541] [The Burden of Interactive Alignment with Inconsistent Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16368)
*Ali Shirali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究用户如何通过战略性互动来引导算法与其真实兴趣对齐，提出了一个双系统决策模型，并定义了"对齐负担"的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在算法交互中经常表现出不一致的偏好，花费时间在低价值内容上，这引发了一个关键问题：用户需要什么条件才能让算法与其真实兴趣对齐。

Method: 将用户决策过程建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长）的双系统模型，研究多领导者、单跟随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 发现存在一个关键时间范围：足够有远见的用户可以实现对齐，而短视的用户则会被算法目标同化。额外的小成本信号（如额外点击）能显著降低对齐负担。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了具有不一致偏好的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中让参与驱动的算法与其兴趣对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在解决方案。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

### [542] [Before you <think>, monitor: Implementing Flavell's metacognitive framework in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16374)
*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的三阶段迭代系统，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有方法且需要更少的尝试次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法存在两大孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制；生成-验证方法能迭代优化但缺乏任务评估。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无战略基础的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现监控-生成-验证三阶段迭代系统，将策略规划与输出验证相结合。

Result: 在GSM8K上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE的68.44%和Self-Verification的67.07%，且只需1.3次尝试（对比2.0次），推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前期监控能产生更高质量的初始解决方案，减少优化需求，但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进一步验证通用性。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

TL;DR: 提出受人类智能启发的HSCM因果框架，通过解耦和重加权图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状）来提升跨领域泛化能力，在理论和实证评估中优于现有领域泛化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统领域泛化模型的局限性，模仿人类视觉系统的分层处理和多层次学习机制，专注于建模细粒度因果机制。

Method: 基于人类智能的层次化处理思想，解耦和重加权关键图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状），构建结构因果模型来增强跨领域泛化。

Result: HSCM在理论和实证评估中均优于现有领域泛化模型，提供了更原则性的方法来捕捉因果关系并提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSCM框架通过模仿人类智能的灵活性和适应性，在动态复杂环境中实现了更有效的迁移学习，为领域泛化提供了新的因果建模方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RGMem框架，通过多尺度信息压缩和涌现过程实现语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性，解决现有方法在用户建模深度和跨会话连续性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成和显式记忆系统主要关注事实级存储和检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特质的能力，限制了长期有效的用户建模，导致个性化交互浅层化并阻碍跨会话连续性。

Method: 受物理学重正化群思想启发，RGMem框架通过分层粗粒化和重标度操作，在多尺度上组织对话历史：首先从片段中提取语义和用户洞察，然后逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 该框架能够从噪声和微观层面的交互中实现高层次、准确的用户画像，解决了有限上下文窗口和静态参数记忆对跨会话长期用户状态建模的挑战。

Conclusion: RGMem通过将记忆演化建模为多尺度信息压缩和涌现过程，实现了语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性，为个性化持续交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统擅长预测用户偏好，但缺乏将客户评论转化为面向业务的规范性建议的能力。客户反馈对战略增长至关重要，需要从中获得可执行的洞察。

Method: 整合聚类、LLM适配和专家驱动评估的统一业务管道，识别客户情绪中的关键趋势、重复问题和具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与业务目标高度一致，具有推动数据驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，在优化业务策略和最大化客户反馈影响方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

TL;DR: 提出了NP-ENGINE框架，首个专门训练和评估LLMs解决NP-hard问题的综合系统，包含10个任务、可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器。训练出的QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型在NP-BENCH基准上超越GPT-4o，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学、编程等推理任务上表现出色，但解决复杂NP-hard优化问题的能力尚未充分探索。需要专门框架来训练和评估LLMs在这类问题上的表现。

Method: 开发NP-ENGINE框架，包含可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器，支持可扩展的RLVR训练。采用课程学习进行零RLVR训练，并构建NP-BENCH评估基准。

Result: QWEN2.5-7B-NP在NP-BENCH上显著超越GPT-4o，达到同尺寸模型SOTA性能。训练还带来强大的跨领域泛化能力，包括逻辑、谜题、数学等推理任务和非推理任务。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，揭示了RLVR的扩展规律，增加任务多样性可改善跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

<details>

Motivation: 目标是开发一种能够模拟人类技能获取速度的计算模型，超越现有方法的效率限制，更接近大脑中实际存在的心理表征及其学习过程。

Method: 基于轻量线性函数式编程语言，使用向量符号架构编码类型和项。类型采用全息声明性内存的槽值编码方案，项使用Lisp VSA变体。

Result: 提出了Doug语言框架，支持神经网络学习类型，使得嵌入空间中邻近点的类型在结构和内容上都相似。

Conclusion: Doug为实现人类水平的技能获取效率提供了一条可行路径，使计算模型更接近大脑的实际表征和学习机制。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Method: 采用强化学习后训练框架Urban-R1，使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)优化跨地理群体的推理，并以城市区域画像作为代理任务从多模态城市数据提供可衡量的奖励。

Result: 跨多个区域和任务的广泛实验表明，Urban-R1有效缓解了地理偏见并改善了跨区域泛化，优于监督微调训练和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习对齐是实现公平可信城市智能的有前景路径，Urban-R1框架为解决城市AI模型的地理偏见问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language

knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)，一种协调协议，让智能体不仅分享决策，还分享轻量级敏感度信号，从而在群体中实现更快更稳定的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的A2A和ACP等通信协议强调通信而非协调，随着智能体群体规模扩大，这会导致脆弱的集体行为，即使单个智能体很聪明，群体结果也很差。

Method: REP协议让智能体分享决策和轻量级敏感度信号（表达关键环境变量变化时选择如何变化），这些敏感度在本地网络中传播。协议规范分离了必需的消息模式和可选的聚合规则。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中：(i)供应链级联（啤酒游戏）、(ii)稀疏网络中的偏好聚合（电影调度）、(iii)可持续资源分配（渔业银行），REP相比A2A将协调准确性和效率提高了41%到100%，并能灵活处理来自LLM的多模态敏感度信号。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的智能体互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法难以从文本丰富的知识图谱中为复杂现实查询检索准确多样的信息，而过程奖励模型需要昂贵的过程级监督信号。

Method: 使用基于转移的流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，流估计器将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，指导检索策略按奖励比例从知识图谱中检索候选结果。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，GraphFlow比包括GPT-4o在内的强基线平均提高了10%的命中率和召回率，并对未见过的知识图谱表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow能有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确多样的知识，展现出良好的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: 现有不确定知识图谱补全方法忽略了置信度分布的极度不平衡性，导致学习到的嵌入不足以支持高质量的知识图谱补全。

Method: 将每个三元组置信度转换为置信度分布，引入更多监督信息；通过关系学习在标记数据和带有伪标签的未标记数据上迭代学习嵌入；使用元学习预测未见三元组的置信度来增强训练数据并重新平衡置信度分布。

Result: 在两个不确定知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，ssCDL在不同评估指标上始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ssCDL方法通过处理置信度分布不平衡问题，有效提升了不确定知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有的RL范式依赖稀疏的结果奖励和有限的探索，导致LLM陷入重复和次优的推理模式。需要设计更好的探索机制来改善LLM的多步推理能力。

Method: 使用基于计数的探索思想，通过轻量级的Coin Flipping Network(CFN)估计推理轨迹的伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转换为内在奖励，并与任务奖励结合。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于大语言模型的代理框架(AFL)，用于完全自动化解决复杂车辆路径问题，从问题实例到解决方案无需人工干预，在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解决复杂车辆路径问题需要大量专家努力进行意图解释和算法设计，现有LLM方法仍依赖外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误和解决方案可行性低。

Method: AFL框架直接从原始输入中提取知识，实现自包含的代码生成，无需手工模块或外部求解器。通过将整体流程分解为三个可管理的子任务，并采用四个专业代理的协调交互来确保跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性。

Result: 在60个复杂VRP问题上的广泛实验验证了框架的有效性和通用性，与精心设计的算法性能相当，在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有LLM基线方法，在评估基准上接近100%的成功率。

Conclusion: AFL框架实现了从问题实例到解决方案的完全自动化，为复杂车辆路径问题的自主解决提供了可信赖的解决方案，显著提升了LLM在运筹优化问题中的应用效果。

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Conclusion: 代理模型与可解释AI的耦合能够有效解决仿真驱动工作流中的计算成本和透明度问题，支持大规模系统探索和决策制定。

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了ELMM模型用于多模态知识图谱补全，通过多视图视觉令牌压缩器和注意力剪枝策略，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKG存在不完整性问题，而将MLLMs应用于MKGC面临图像令牌过多导致语义噪声和模态冲突，以及高计算成本的挑战

Method: 提出多视图视觉令牌压缩器(MVTC)自适应压缩图像令牌，设计注意力剪枝策略移除冗余层，并使用线性投影补偿性能损失

Result: 在FB15k-237-IMG和WN18-IMG基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时大幅提升计算效率

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新范式，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交互本质上是多模态和全双工的，需要同时感知和生成多种模态信息。现有模型难以实现这种自然的交互模式。

Method: 提出SA-MoE架构，将各模态路由到专门的专家模块，通过统一注意力主干进行融合，实现联合多模态感知和并发生成。

Result: 在语音交互和机器人操作基准测试中，ELLSA与单模态基线性能相当，同时支持高级多模态和全双工行为。

Conclusion: ELLSA代表了向更自然和通用交互智能迈出的一步，有助于实现人工通用智能。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图理解中存在输入令牌限制导致的可扩展性瓶颈，以及缺乏有效机制来协调文本和视觉模态的问题。

Method: GraphVista采用分层组织图信息到轻量级GraphRAG基础中，仅检索任务相关的文本描述和高分辨率视觉子图；引入规划代理根据任务复杂度路由到最适合的模态。

Result: GraphVista能够扩展到比现有基准大200倍的图，在文本、视觉和融合方法中表现最优，相比最先进基线实现了4.4倍的质量提升。

Conclusion: GraphVista通过充分利用两种模态的互补优势，有效解决了图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定本体论的刚性层次结构，问题根源在于将领域视为隐式上下文而非显式的推理级组件。

Method: 采用C-D-C三元组结构，基于认知-语言同构映射原则，定义20多个标准化关系谓词，并在Prolog中实现完整推理能力。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和文档管理等案例中，CDC实现了上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模等传统本体框架无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: CDC框架通过将领域提升为一等元素，克服了传统知识图谱的局限性，为知识表示和推理提供了更灵活强大的方法。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Motivation: 训练VLM智能体面临从文本状态到复杂视觉观察的转变挑战，这引入了部分可观测性并需要强大的世界建模能力。研究旨在探索VLM智能体是否能够通过显式视觉状态推理构建内部世界模型。

Conclusion: 视觉状态推理能够显著提升VLM智能体性能，最优表示形式取决于任务特性，自然语言适合语义关系，结构化格式适合精确操控。所提出的方法在VAGEN框架中验证有效。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释强化学习算法在调试方面应用广泛，但缺乏对其相对性能的比较评估。需要了解用户是否能从算法解释中准确识别智能体的目标。

Method: 使用Atari的Ms. Pacman环境和四种可解释强化学习算法，通过用户实验测试他们从解释中识别智能体目标的能力，并收集用户的自信程度和易理解性反馈。

Result: 只有一种算法的准确率超过随机水平；用户普遍过于自信；用户自我报告的易理解性与实际识别准确率没有相关性。

Conclusion: 当前的可解释强化学习算法在帮助用户理解智能体目标方面效果有限，用户的自信程度和感知的易理解性不能作为算法有效性的可靠指标。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation

environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

*Hassan Hamad,Yingru Xu,Liang Zhao,Wenbo Yan,Narendra Gyanchandani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolCritic是一个诊断框架，用于评估和改进LLM在多轮工具增强对话中的行为，通过检测8种特定工具调用错误并提供针对性反馈，使主LLM能修正响应，在SGD数据集上工具调用准确率提升高达13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的大型语言模型在现实应用中越来越普遍，但工具使用错误仍然阻碍其可靠性，需要解决这一问题以提高LLM与外部工具集成的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入ToolCritic框架，系统定义8种工具调用错误类型，构建合成数据集训练ToolCritic，主LLM基于ToolCritic的反馈修正响应。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验结果表明，ToolCritic相比零样本提示和自校正等基线方法，工具调用准确率提升高达13%。

Conclusion: ToolCritic是朝着在现实世界对话应用中更鲁棒地集成LLM与外部工具迈出的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

TL;DR: BRAINCELL-AID是一个多智能体AI系统，通过整合自由文本描述和本体标签来改进基因集注释，解决了传统方法在注释未知基因特征时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序技术虽然能识别多样细胞类型，但注释这些特征（特别是涉及未知基因的特征）仍然是一个重大挑战。传统方法如GSEA依赖精心策划的注释，在这些情况下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了BRAINCELL-AID多智能体AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过PubMed文献精炼预测，减少幻觉并增强可解释性。

Result: 在小鼠基因集的注释中，77%的基因集在其前几位预测中获得了正确注释。应用该方法注释了BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式并推断基因集合的功能作用。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID创建了一个有价值的资源来支持社区驱动的细胞类型注释，能够识别具有神经学意义描述的基底神经节相关细胞类型。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种基于大语言模型的系统（单代理系统NAS和辩论式多代理系统KPD-MADS），用于企业信用评估中的证据推理，相比人工评估显著提升了效率，且多代理系统在推理质量上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融AI方法主要关注数值预测，无法有效处理企业信用评估中具有决定性影响但难以形式化的定性非财务指标，缺乏对专业贷款评估所需解释性判断的支持。

Method: 开发了两种LLM系统：单代理系统（NAS）通过单次推理流程生成双向分析；辩论式多代理系统（KPD-MADS）基于卡尔·波普批判性对话框架，采用十步结构化交互协议进行对抗性验证。

Result: 在三个真实企业案例中，两种系统相比人工评估均实现显著效率提升（NAS：11.55秒/案例；KPD-MADS：91.97秒；人工基线：1920秒）。KPD-MADS在解释充分性（4.0 vs 3.0）、实际适用性（4.0 vs 3.0）和可用性（62.5 vs 52.5）方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互能够增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推进企业信用评估的可扩展和可辩护自动化。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于手工特征的方法，通过提取和融合颜色统计、多颜色空间直方图以及纹理特征来评估鱼类新鲜度，在FFE数据集上取得了显著优于深度学习的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要客观、自动化的解决方案来确保食品质量和消费者健康。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取并增量融合互补特征描述符，包括颜色统计、多颜色空间直方图、局部二值模式(LBP)和灰度共生矩阵(GLCM)等纹理特征，同时捕获全局色度变化和局部ROI区域退化。

Result: 在标准训练测试设置下，LightGBM分类器达到77.56%准确率，比之前深度学习基线63.21%提升14.35%；使用增强数据时，人工神经网络(ANN)达到97.16%准确率，比之前最佳77.3%提升19.86%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征经过策略性处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供鲁棒、可解释且可靠的解决方案，为食品质量监控的实际应用提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了PILLM框架，将物理原理融入大型语言模型，通过进化循环自动生成、评估和优化HVAC系统异常检测规则，在保持可解释性的同时提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的方法可解释性强但缺乏适应性，深度学习方法预测能力强但缺乏透明度和物理合理性，现有LLM方法忽略了HVAC系统的物理原理。

Method: 开发了PILLM框架，引入物理知识引导的反思和交叉算子，嵌入热力学和控制理论约束，在进化循环中自动生成和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公共建筑故障检测数据集上的实验表明，PILLM实现了最先进的性能，同时生成可解释和可操作的诊断规则。

Conclusion: PILLM推进了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，在保持物理合理性的同时提升了异常检测的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

TL;DR: ProtocolBench是一个系统评估多智能体系统通信协议的基准测试，比较了任务成功率、延迟、消息开销和容错性四个维度。研究还提出了ProtocolRouter，一个可学习的协议路由器，能根据场景需求动态选择最优协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中，通信协议选择对性能和可靠性至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化评估方法，选择往往基于直觉而非数据。

Method: 开发ProtocolBench基准测试系统，在四个可测量维度上比较不同协议；提出ProtocolRouter，基于需求和运行时信号为每个场景或模块选择最优协议。

Result: 协议选择显著影响系统行为：在流式队列场景中，完成时间差异达36.5%，端到端延迟差异达3.48秒；ProtocolRouter相比最佳单协议基线，故障恢复时间减少18.1%，在GAIA场景中成功率更高。

Conclusion: 协议选择对多智能体系统性能有重大影响，ProtocolBench提供了标准化评估方法，ProtocolRouter通过动态协议选择显著提升了系统性能和可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合ECG基础模型和XGBoost的混合预测框架，用于预测急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常风险，在提高准确性的同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECG基础模型提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)，SHAP分析显示模型识别特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了新范式，验证了基础模型输出作为有效自动化特征工程在构建可信赖、可解释AI临床决策支持系统中的应用。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Motivation: 探索工具增强的LLM健康教练在真实用户中的表现，特别关注个性化策略对不同用户群体的影响，避免平均指标掩盖的群体伤害。

Method: 使用离线策略评估分析工具/风格决策头，通过轻量级模拟器测试添加信息增益奖励的效果，采用冻结生成器、学习子群体感知决策头的方法。

Result: 统一重工具策略对低健康素养/高自我效能用户有害；添加早期信息增益奖励可缩短特征识别时间，提高目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 提出评估优先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，基于类型化奖励学习子群体感知决策头，并始终报告按原型分类的指标以揭示被平均值掩盖的子群体伤害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Motivation: 准确建模疾病进展（如2型糖尿病）可以改善患者亚型分型和及时干预，但现有方法难以处理不规则时间采样数据和患者异质性，无法捕捉复杂的连续时间动态。

Method: TD-HNODE将疾病进展表示为时间详细超图，使用神经ODE框架学习连续时间进展动态，包含可学习的TD-Hypergraph Laplacian来捕捉疾病并发症标记在进展轨迹内和轨迹间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实临床数据集上的实验表明，TD-HNODE在2型糖尿病和相关心血管疾病进展建模方面优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-HNODE能够有效建模疾病进展的连续时间动态，解决了现有方法在处理不规则时间采样和患者异质性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data

Motivation: 解决密集多智能体路径规划问题中实时寻找近优解的挑战，现有学习方法在MAPF中表现不佳。

Method: 结合学习到的启发式（来自MAGAT神经网络）和搜索算法LaCAM，采用增强的MAGAT架构、预训练-微调策略和死锁检测机制。

Result: 在密集场景中，LaGAT超越了纯搜索和纯学习方法，证明了混合搜索的有效性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的混合搜索为紧密耦合的复杂多智能体协调问题提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在基于仿真的环境中进行语义引导多样性规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失效的现实非符号领域开辟了新途径

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

TL;DR: 法律机器学习中标签不确定性问题的研究：法律判决结果常受人为干预影响，导致标签不确定性，这会显著影响模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律机器学习通常将历史案件结果视为真实标签，但法律结果常受和解、上诉等程序性干预影响，导致标签不确定性。现有方法基于不可验证的假设来估算这些不确定标签。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案件分类的背景下，研究标签构建方式如何影响模型行为，探讨标签不确定性对AI与法律领域的影响。

Result: 研究表明，训练过程中标签的构建方式会显著影响模型的行为表现。

Conclusion: 标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要关注点，需要被充分考虑，因为它能显著塑造模型的行为特征。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

*Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil,Sharad Duwal,Abhishek Tyagi,Adiba Mahbub Proma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个用于检测多模态虚假信息的推理时框架，通过分解验证过程为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断，无需领域特定训练数据即可达到监督检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿结合文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，超出了人工事实核查的能力。现有的监督检测模型需要领域特定训练数据，且无法泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：检测AI生成图像、识别跨模态不一致、通过迭代问题生成进行检索增强的事实核查，以及整合所有信号的校准判断模块。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集上，MIRAGE达到81.65% F1和75.1%准确率，比最强的零样本基线提升7.65个F1点，同时保持34.3%的假阳性率。测试集结果确认了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 分解的智能推理与网络检索相结合，可以在没有领域特定训练的情况下匹配监督检测器的性能，为标记数据稀缺的多模态虚假信息检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将大型语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到更小、更高效模型中的方法，通过结构感知损失优化来提升代码生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅需要准确的标记预测，更需要理解解决方案级别的结构关系。大型语言模型具备复杂推理能力，但部署成本高，因此需要将这些能力蒸馏到更小的模型中。

Method: 通过训练模型模拟大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确解决方案路径，并通过结构感知损失优化建立问题定义与解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过微调的模型在MBPP、MBPP Plus和HumanEval基准测试中，在pass@1、平均数据流和平均语法匹配等指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过简单且成本低廉的蒸馏过程，可以有效地将大型语言模型的推理能力转移到更小的模型中，实现高效且高质量的代码生成。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释选择的排序系统，需要低延迟的解码器重排序方法。

Method: 采用单解码器方法，结合池化首词评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤，通过专门针对困难案例的课程训练。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择任务中表现优异（快速路径：Recall@1~0.45，nDCG@20~0.625），门控激活时进一步改善（Recall@1~0.56，nDCG@20~0.699，门控率45%），编码器基线在效果和灵活性上都落后。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排序，在需要时解释，这种模式适用于选择性生成能以可接受成本提高准确性的决策任务，单策略设计简化了部署和预算规划。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为图形化框架来解决多智能体强化学习中的协调问题，设计了基于因果推理的预策略干预(PSI)方法实现目标干预范式，通过最大化因果效应来达成复合期望结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模多智能体强化学习中，对整个系统进行全局指导不切实际，而现有的协调机制设计主要依赖经验研究，缺乏易用的研究工具。

Method: 引入MAIDs框架分析现有MARL方法，设计目标干预范式，并提出预策略干预(PSI)因果推理技术来实现该范式，通过捆绑相关性图分析验证学习范式的可行性。

Result: 实验证明所提出的目标干预方法有效，并验证了相关性图分析的结果。

Conclusion: MAIDs框架为解决MARL中的协调问题提供了有效的图形化工具，目标干预范式能够缓解全局指导的困难，PSI方法通过因果效应最大化实现复合期望结果。

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Motivation: LLMs在多任务适应中存在灾难性遗忘和资源消耗大的问题，现有参数高效方法在复杂多任务场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出上下文注意力调制(CAM)机制动态调节自注意力表示，结合共享全参数CAM模块和多个轻量级专用CAM模块，采用动态路由策略进行自适应知识融合。

Conclusion: HyCAM框架通过上下文注意力调制机制有效平衡了知识保留和任务特定专业化，实现了更高效的多任务适应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Motivation: 系统研究VLMs失败的原因：是未能感知视觉证据还是未能有效利用证据，发现存在"看见但不相信"的现象。

Method: 通过层间注意力动态分析，发现深层稀疏但可靠地关注局部证据区域；提出推理时干预方法，通过选择性注意力掩码突出深层证据区域。

Conclusion: VLMs内部编码了可靠的证据但未充分利用，使这些信号显式化可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，推进VLM的诊断理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.
