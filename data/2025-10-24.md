### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习检测StyleGAN生成的图像，通过二维离散傅里叶变换和ResNet50网络，在频域中识别GAN图像的周期性伪影，准确率达92.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成对抗网络(GANs)产生的逼真图像对图像取证和需要可靠内容真实性的工业系统构成严重挑战，需要有效区分真实图像和GAN生成图像的方法。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到傅里叶域，利用ResNet50神经网络在频域中训练模型来区分真实图像和合成图像。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%的准确率和0.95的AUC值，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像具有独特的频域特征或"指纹"，结合信号处理技术和深度学习的方法具有增强数字取证和加强工业AI系统可信度的工业潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

### [2] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度计算敏感度分数，解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角下的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角下会产生严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测的不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度推导敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，而不是各向同性方差。

Result: 实验评估表明，与现有NeRF方法相比，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性，并能实时集成到现有3DGS渲染管线中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角外时的生成不确定性核心问题，无需大量后训练或微调。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [3] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D对象时的挑战，包括需要大量标注数据以及CNN可能忽略关键形状关系的问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers架构结合对比监督和自监督学习目标，通过ViT理解整体形状，对比学习优化局部判别特征。

Result: 在ModelNet10上监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，在多视角3D分析任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ViT与对比学习的结合有效克服了传统方法的局限性，无需大量标注数据即可捕获全局形状语义和局部特征。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

*Xiaohan Sun,Carol O'Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究不同细节层次和观察距离下用户对人群角色视觉质量的感知，比较几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯等表示方法的视觉保真度与计算性能权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同人群角色表示方法在视觉质量和计算性能之间的平衡，为感知优化的细节层次策略设计提供指导

Method: 通过定性和定量分析，比较几何网格、图像代理、NeRF和3D高斯四种表示方法在不同细节层次和观察距离下的表现

Result: 每种表示方法在视觉保真度和计算性能方面展现出不同的权衡特性

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计感知优化的细节层次人群渲染策略提供了重要见解

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how users perceive the visual quality of crowd
character representations at different levels of detail (LoD) and viewing
distances. Each representation: geometric meshes, image-based impostors, Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs), and 3D Gaussians, exhibits distinct trade-offs between
visual fidelity and computational performance. Our qualitative and quantitative
results provide insights to guide the design of perceptually optimized LoD
strategies for crowd rendering.

### [5] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个模块化的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过引入基于transformer的平滑器和融合驱动的跟踪器，在现有3D检测器基础上构建，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上实现了74.7 aMOTA的强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于查询的跟踪方法主要依赖单一传感器，而多模态传感器融合能提供更丰富的几何和语义信息，特别是在遮挡和视角变化情况下实现更鲁棒的重新识别。

Method: 采用多模态两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流水线，融合相机和LiDAR的BEV特征，无需显式运动模型；使用时间平滑器在移动窗口内精炼边界框序列，减少抖动并改善空间一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现出色，减少了身份切换同时保持竞争性精度，证明了多模态传感器特征相比单传感器方法的显著优势。

Conclusion: FutrTrack为改进基于transformer的跟踪器提供了一个高效框架，即使数据有限且无需预训练，也能与其他基于神经网络的方法竞争。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [6] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)通过动态调整软标签来改善医学图像分类中的过度自信预测，在RadImageNet数据集上相比传统方法提升了Top-1和Top-5准确率，并产生更紧凑的特征嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响可靠性。传统标签平滑方法将所有非目标类别同等对待，忽略了类别间的关系。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏等方法，持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑、分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向失真和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，在鱼眼交通图像上训练多种先进检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中获得F1分数0.6366，在62支队伍中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，证明了其在鱼眼图像检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [8] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个结合物理建模和机器学习的混合框架，用于实现定量经颅超声脑成像，通过两阶段方法在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下重建准确的大脑声速图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理方法受颅骨引起的信号衰减和相位畸变限制，而纯数据驱动方法在低信噪比条件下会产生定量偏差。需要一种能结合两者优势的方法来克服经颅超声成像的挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移（时间反转声学）从多角度采集生成保留结构细节的迁移片段；第二阶段使用基于Transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器，结合图注意力单元融合这些片段为连贯的声速图像。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面优于其他方法，展示了其在定量超声脑成像中的潜力。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle通过物理建模与机器学习的结合，成功解决了经颅超声成像中的定量精度问题，为临床可行的定量超声脑成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [9] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，发现T2I和I2I系统普遍存在偏向全球北方、现代风格的描绘，I2I编辑会削弱文化保真度，且模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知的文化变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑系统的文化偏见尚未充分探索，需要建立统一评估框架来诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏差。

Method: 采用统一评估框架，涵盖六个国家、8大类36子类的分类体系，结合时代感知提示，使用固定设置的开放模型进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别评估，结合自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家判断。

Result: 研究发现：1）国家无关提示下模型默认全球北方现代风格描绘；2）迭代I2I编辑会侵蚀文化保真度；3）I2I模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知变化，对全球南方目标常保留源身份。

Conclusion: 当前系统的文化敏感编辑仍不可靠，通过发布标准化数据、提示和人工评估协议，为诊断和追踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [10] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步重建方法，用于从移动事件相机的事件重建强度图像。该方法使用IIR滤波器集成强度变化，通过检测陈旧像素并应用高斯滤波来减少噪声，能够在CPU上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖GPU上的神经网络，计算复杂且昂贵。需要一种更简单、高效的异步重建方法，能够在CPU上实时处理事件数据。

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器集成事件信号强度变化；通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并维护最近更新像素窗口；对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波，基于移动相机中无事件区域可能具有低图像梯度的假设。

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度达42-140百万事件/秒；重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且存在重影，但足以完成某些任务如基准标记检测。

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单有效的异步图像重建替代方案，虽然质量不如神经网络方法，但在计算效率和实时性方面具有优势，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过数据自适应的张量核范数和双边结构，有效捕捉全局和局部相关性，并整合ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数正则化来处理复杂噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要更有效的模型来捕捉图像数据的全局和局部相关性，并处理真实场景中的复杂噪声。

Method: 提出TBTLRR模型，引入数据自适应的张量核范数学习任意酉变换，利用双边结构捕捉图像样本和特征间的局部相关性，整合ℓ₁/₂范数和Frobenius范数正则化，并基于ADMM开发高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证TBTLRR在聚类任务上优于现有最先进方法，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换和双边结构有效提升了张量低秩表示的性能，在图像聚类中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和手术数据科学在手术培训、研究和质量改进中有重要作用，但受限于异构记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，基于用户反馈迭代开发。通过内部调查确定隐私设计架构，外部调查评估可用性和采用度，并进行不同硬件配置的基准测试。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性评分（临床医生4.68/5，计算机科学家4.03/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07/7）、易用性（5.15/7）和强推荐度（9.20/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，但需要合规认证和更广泛的互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [13] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Attentive Convolution (ATConv)，通过将自注意力的自适应路由和侧向抑制机制融入卷积操作，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升CNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强但计算复杂度高，而传统卷积虽然计算效率高但性能存在差距。本文旨在揭示自注意力优于卷积的内在原理，并设计能结合两者优势的新算子。

Method: 提出ATConv，通过动态调节位置信息流（自适应路由）和引入token权重竞争机制（侧向抑制）来增强传统卷积的表达能力。

Result: ATConv在仅使用3×3核的情况下，在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中替换自注意力可降低FID 0.15。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积操作，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了超越自注意力的性能，为高效视觉骨干网络提供了新方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher是一个基于扩散模型的框架，专门用于生成像素级手绘草图，通过优化VAE解码和集成基于视觉问答的奖励函数来提升文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在合成像素级手绘草图（抽象表达的代表）方面仍面临挑战，现有方法难以生成具有高提示保真度的手绘草图。

Method: 1. 微调变分自编码器以优化潜在解码，更好地捕捉草图特征；2. 集成基于视觉问答的新奖励函数用于强化学习，改善文本-图像对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，StableSketcher生成的草图具有改进的风格保真度，与提示的对齐效果优于Stable Diffusion基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出了StableSketcher框架和SketchDUO数据集（首个包含实例级草图、标题和问答对的数据集），解决了现有数据集依赖图像-标签对的局限性，为手绘草图生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型的额外监督源，通过生成合成标题来训练BIOCAP模型，在物种分类和图文检索方面取得良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像和标题可被视为物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，但获取大规模实例特异性标题存在挑战，这限制了自然语言监督在生物领域的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科视觉信息和分类群定制格式示例，减少幻觉并产生准确的实例描述性标题。

Result: 训练的BIOCAP模型能够捕获丰富的语义，在物种分类和图文检索任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 描述性标题在连接生物图像与多模态基础模型方面具有重要价值，超越了传统标签的作用。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Conclusion: 逆图像渲染方法能有效从单张图像生成光场，为光场应用提供了更便捷的获取途径。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LogitGap方法，通过利用最大logit与其他logit之间的关系来增强ID和OOD样本的可分离性，实现高效的OOD检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法未能充分利用模型logit空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能。

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，利用最大logit与剩余logit的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logit子集进行评分。

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间关系，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且性能优越的后处理方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有数据集如PartNet依赖无纹理几何和专家标注，限制了可扩展性和可用性，需要新一代数据集来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建包含纹理3D模型和分层部件标注的大规模数据集，并在类无关部件分割和3D部件中心问答两个任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 现有方法在细粒度部件分割上表现不佳，3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位方面存在显著差距；在PartNeXt上训练Point-SAM相比PartNet有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，骑行者属于易受伤害的道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车关节结构变化带来的姿态变化。

Method: 提出联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点的模型，使用合成和真实图像数据进行训练，能够估计自行车的3D平移、旋转以及车把和踏板的相对旋转角度。

Result: 该方法在8D姿态参数估计上表现出有前景的结果，在与使用刚性模板匹配的最先进6D姿态估计器比较时获得了有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 8D姿态估计能够提供更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向信息，对自动驾驶系统中的骑行者行为理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，在封闭世界和开放世界设置下均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了组合零样本学习中的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAEs竞争的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAEs和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架成功实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程有效解决了长期时空一致性建模的计算效率问题，为增强现实等应用提供了高质量的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Motivation: 脑MRI基础模型的发展依赖于数据的规模、多样性和一致性，但目前缺乏对这些因素的系统评估。

Method: 在数据集层面分析模态组成、疾病覆盖和规模；在图像层面量化体素间距、方向和强度分布；评估预处理变异性；使用3D DenseNet121进行特征空间案例研究。

Result: 发现健康人群与临床人群数据存在严重不平衡，预处理步骤改善了数据集内一致性但无法消除数据集间差异，标准化预处理后仍存在可测量的残差协变量偏移。

Conclusion: 公共脑MRI资源存在显著变异性，仅靠数据协调无法消除数据集间偏差，需要预处理感知和领域自适应策略来开发可泛化的脑MRI基础模型。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关、成本高效且可扩展的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设定了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle提出了一种基于流模型的免反演图像编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化和循环一致性优化，实现目标感知的中间状态构建，在保持源图像一致性的同时实现忠实修改。


<details>

Motivation: 当前文本到图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略与特定编辑目标的语义差距，导致当期望修改与源图像显著偏离时编辑能力有限或不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化腐败过程，并利用循环一致性过程优化这些噪声。通过迭代地将源图像编辑到目标图像并恢复回源图像，在双重一致性约束下学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 广泛的消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过目标感知的中间状态构建和循环一致性优化，实现了更好的文本引导图像编辑效果，在保持源图像一致性的同时实现更忠实的修改。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统胎儿运动检测方法（如母体感知和胎心监护）存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题，需要更可靠的客观监测方法。

Method: 使用双重对比损失（空间和时间对比学习）的自监督学习框架，结合任务特定采样策略和概率微调方法。

Result: 在92名受试者的30分钟超声会话数据集上，达到78.01%的敏感度和81.60%的AUROC。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有潜力，为改进产前监测和临床决策铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: EditInfinity 通过精确的图像反演和有效的编辑策略，实现了高质量的文本驱动图像编辑，优于现有的扩散模型方法。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时更容易产生幻觉，但问题根源不是长度本身，而是对上下文依赖的增加。作者开发了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时幻觉问题更严重，传统观点认为是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"框架：通过设计特定上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码时抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著改进，验证了框架的有效性，并重新验证了关于上下文依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 幻觉风险主要源于长文本中对上下文依赖的增加，而非长度本身。该研究为深入探索LVLMs长文本幻觉问题提供了新视角和初步解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果差，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致误差累积，需要一种能有效整合语言和分割线索的新方法。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场框架有效解决了开放词汇3D分割中的关键挑战，在多个应用场景中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而未能有效利用词级信号

Method: 双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入token角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试中，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 解耦的语义建模在视频-语言对齐中非常有效，能够同时捕获粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Method: 提出掩码位置编码方案利用分割掩码捕获空间坐标和对象轮廓；设计上下文增强模块使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征

Result: 在两个公开数据集上达到最先进性能，在具有挑战性的地面到卫星场景中定位精度提升3.39%

Conclusion: 为推进跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范例和上下文建模框架

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别准确性

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Conclusion: GMFVAD通过细粒度多模态特征处理有效减少了视频特征中的冗余信息，显著提升了视频异常检测的性能

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时带来76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令作为动态分析路径；采用两阶段训练框架：先在合成的多样化指令上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个grounding基准测试中达到SOTA：UI-I2E-Bench 87.3%、ScreenSpot-Pro 57.0%、MMBench-GUI L2 84.9%；在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了grounding性能，还展现出涌现推理能力，能够选择性地组合和合成新的指令路径，同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一种高效的多模态对齐训练范式，通过双曲空间解决了视觉与文本模态间的粒度对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩泛化能力不足的问题，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对分布外数据处理的低效。

Method: 使用通用上下文模型捕获空间和通道维度的上下文依赖，并提出实例自适应微调策略，结合显式和隐式压缩范式，为每个实例微调少量网络权重。

Result: 在15个多样化数据集上的广泛实验证实，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩的泛化挑战，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，导致性能下降。现有方法未能有效解决这种误差积累问题。

Method: AccuQuant在多个去噪步骤中显式模拟扩散采样过程，最小化全精度模型与量化版本之间的输出差异，并提出高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降至O(1)。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差积累问题，为扩散模型提供了有效的后训练量化解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究发现DiTs中的补丁令牌即使位置编码被扰动仍能产生全局一致输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制，这启发了将位置编码从2D平面扩展到3D场的研究。

Method: 提出位置编码场(PE-Field)，包含用于体积推理的深度感知编码和用于细粒度子补丁控制的分层编码，使DiTs能够在3D空间中直接建模几何。

Conclusion: 位置编码场通过将2D位置编码扩展到结构化3D场，显著提升了DiTs在3D几何建模和空间控制方面的能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱中的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致跨模态表示学习忽略不明显的食谱特定细节，在相似食谱检索时难以区分细微差异。

Method: 使用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入跨模态表示学习以减轻偏差。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化美食数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，在两个数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法有效缓解了图像到食谱检索中的偏差问题，能够捕捉细微的烹饪细节，提升检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action RLVR训练框架。

Result: 在六个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct平均准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan在多步骤视频推理中表现出色，并能有效泛化到长视频理解任务，验证了其强大的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过提高推断可靠性来减少公平性估计的偏差和方差

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了新范式，通过双向概念蒸馏机制实现了概念个性化与生成质量的协同提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Metis-HOME混合优化专家混合框架，通过将密集模型分为思考分支和非思考分支，解决多模态推理模型中效率与泛化能力的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型存在两个关键局限：对简单查询使用计算昂贵的推理导致效率低下，以及专注于专业推理损害了更广泛的通用理解能力。

Method: 将原始密集模型构建为两个专家分支：思考分支用于复杂多步推理，非思考分支用于快速直接推理。使用轻量级可训练路由器动态分配查询到最合适的专家。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B实现MoE架构。

Result: 该方法不仅显著增强了复杂推理能力，还改善了模型的通用能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型中观察到的退化趋势。

Conclusion: 为构建强大且通用的多模态大语言模型建立了新范式，有效解决了推理与泛化之间的普遍困境。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext框架，通过精细化的面部区域划分和数据标注，解决了现有可解释深度伪造分析方法缺乏细粒度感知的问题，并引入了新的伪影定位解释任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在局限性：数据标注不可靠且粒度粗，模型无法输出文本解释与视觉伪影之间的连接关系，也不能支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 首先定义了面部图像概念树来划分面部区域，建立了FiFa-Annotator数据标注流程；然后提出了伪影定位解释任务；最后构建了统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在伪影定位解释任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过精细化的数据标注和多任务学习架构，显著提升了可解释深度伪造分析的细粒度感知能力，为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合估计模糊图像中潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹的深度学习框架，通过可解释的模块化架构实现运动去模糊，在严重模糊情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相机抖动（特别是大范围或旋转运动）引起的运动模糊问题，传统端到端去模糊网络在严重或空间变化模糊情况下效果不佳。

Method: 使用投影运动模糊模型（PMBM），通过神经网络预测完整的3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络，并通过后处理优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可解释的相机运动轨迹估计，实现了有效的运动去模糊，为理解模糊形成机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust

TL;DR: ACamera-Net是一个轻量级、场景自适应的相机参数调整网络，直接从RAW输入预测最优曝光和白平衡，提升复杂光照条件下的图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级相机在复杂光照条件（如低光、高动态范围、背光）下图像质量不稳定的问题，包括曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，这些会降低下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 提出ACamera-Net框架，包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure（估计ISO缓解曝光不足和对比度损失）和ACamera-Color（预测相关色温和增益因子改善色彩一致性）。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像管道中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的相机参数调整问题，在边缘设备上实现实时性能。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，通过整合显式时空证据到视频推理中，在生成答案的同时突出显示关键时间戳、对象和边界框，使推理能够基于具体的视觉观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型仅生成文本推理轨迹而不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置，而将证据中心推理能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 首先构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，提供统一的时空监督和推理轨迹；然后采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励来共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准测试中，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进的性能，将Qwen2.5-VL基线的mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在VideoMME、WorldSense、VideoMMMU和TVGBench等多个视频理解基准测试中也观察到一致的改进。

Conclusion: 除了准确性，Open-o3 Video生成的推理轨迹还为测试时缩放提供了有价值的信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

TL;DR: GenColorBench是首个专注于文本到图像生成中颜色精度的综合基准测试，包含4.4万个颜色相关提示，涵盖400多种颜色，通过感知和自动评估揭示模型在颜色生成方面的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，无法准确匹配文本提示中指定的颜色。现有基准测试要么忽视颜色评估，要么依赖粗略评估，缺乏对RGB值解释和人类期望对齐等关键能力的系统评估。

Method: 基于ISCC-NBS和CSS3/X11等颜色系统构建GenColorBench基准，包含44K个颜色聚焦提示，覆盖400多种颜色，包括其他地方缺失的数值颜色，通过感知和自动化评估方法进行模型评估。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能存在差异，揭示了模型最理解的颜色约定类型，并识别了失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench评估将指导精确颜色生成的改进，该基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出基于相似性原型的跨模态分割框架，通过类别原型学习和对比学习来解决域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在域偏移下性能急剧下降，无监督域适应旨在减少域差距并避免新域的昂贵标注成本。

Method: 学习嵌入空间中的类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离，使用字典存储不同图像的原型以解决类别缺失问题并实现对比学习。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架能有效提升跨模态分割性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自由移动物体从单目视频中重建的挑战，特别是在没有可靠位姿或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用双键记忆模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导的记忆读取和高效稀疏化机制，将当前帧特征与时间聚合的物体状态稳健融合。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，在重建质量和计算效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

Motivation: 长视频理解面临计算复杂度高、推理不聚焦的问题，现有帧选择方法忽略时序依赖或依赖单模态证据，无法提供完整且与查询相关的上下文。

Method: 提出训练无关、模型无关的SeViCES框架，包含SVCFS模块（时序感知语义分支和聚类引导视觉分支）和ACR模块（证据融合和答案空间约束）。

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架能有效提升长视频理解性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D医学影像的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率长序列体积时存在挑战：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不匹配，切片级tokenization会模糊精细解剖结构，降低下游任务的诊断性能。

Method: 采用因果卷积编码器-解码器架构，统一2D和3D训练推理，生成紧凑的频率感知体积token。通过三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺、长上下文解码器精炼，模型能从短切片片段学习并泛化到超过300切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务上，FID降低75%，FVD减半，能生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积。

reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集和针对精细细节合成的专门训练策略。

Method: 引入UltraHR-100K数据集（10万张超过3K分辨率的图像），并提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样和软加权频率正则化。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中，该方法显著提高了超高分辨率图像生成的精细细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和训练策略有效提升了超高分辨率文本到图像生成的细节质量，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

TL;DR: 提出两种技术解决多比特量化网络训练开销大的问题：权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样，在保持模型性能的同时大幅减少训练时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多比特量化网络需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复全数据集训练，训练开销随精度数量线性增长，且需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项

Method: 1. 权重偏置校正：通过中和不同比特宽度下的量化诱导偏置和对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化，无需微调；2. 比特级核心集采样：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在保持竞争性或更优准确率的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著降低了多比特量化网络的训练开销，无需牺牲模型效用，为灵活部署提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种针对大型视觉语言模型KV缓存压缩的新方法，通过混合重要性和多样性来优化压缩效果，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖可能丢失。

Method: MixKV方法分析KV缓存在不同注意力头中的冗余程度，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来选择性压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性指标。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下，MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI grounding任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别提升8.0%和9.0%，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过混合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能，并可无缝扩展到LLMs。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损距离图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点数损失的完整点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种无需外部校准就能实现无损投影的通用方法。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光校准校正等关键参数，实现无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: 在完整KITTI和DurLAR数据集上评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美点数保存，所有点云中零点数损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度范围内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: 从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保存的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值方法，有效解决了长时程驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: DyPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整位置编码来扩展扩散变换器的生成分辨率，使其能够生成远超训练分辨率的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高分辨率图像生成时存在计算成本高的问题，因为自注意力机制随图像token数量呈二次方增长。

Method: 利用扩散过程中的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码，使其频率谱与当前生成阶段匹配。

Result: 能够生成1600万像素的高分辨率图像，在多个基准测试中实现最先进的保真度，且分辨率越高效果越明显。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效的无训练方法，显著扩展了预训练扩散变换器的分辨率能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow框架在少步生成建模中表现出色但成功原因不明，研究发现其目标函数存在轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性之间的负相关冲突，导致优化困难和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow统一框架，通过课程策略从轨迹流匹配平滑过渡到MeanFlow，解耦冲突目标，使用标准DiT骨干网络进行训练。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow在多个尺度和设置下均优于MeanFlow，最大模型α-Flow-XL/2+实现了FID 2.58(1步)和2.15(2步)的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦MeanFlow中的冲突目标，实现了更好的收敛性和性能，为标准骨干网络上的少步生成建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Conclusion: SV通过从多个部分准确的推理路径中合成正确见解，相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误纠正和成本效率的双重优势。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

Motivation: 从单张2D图像准确重建3D对象（包括相机姿态、形状和纹理）是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法在姿态估计和形状重建的联合优化方面存在局限。

Method: 采用两阶段流匹配流程：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复；精炼阶段整合姿态对齐的图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在广泛实验中，Cupid在PSNR上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上匹配单目估计器，在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，在3D重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

*Xiaolong Wang,Lixiang Ru,Ziyuan Huang,Kaixiang Ji,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg是一种基于自回归生成的图像分割新范式，将多模态理解和像素级感知统一在单一框架中，通过图像生成自然产生目标对象的密集掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用边界点表示或专用分割头，依赖离散表示或语义提示，限制了MLLM捕捉细粒度视觉细节的能力。

Method: 利用MLLM输出视觉token，通过通用VQ-VAE解码为图像，使分割完全依赖MLLM的像素级理解；采用下一尺度预测策略并行生成视觉token以减少推理延迟。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越先前最先进方法，推理速度显著提升，同时保持强大的理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过图像生成范式成功实现了多模态理解与像素级感知的统一，为图像分割提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于纯Transformer的自回归视频预测模型，在物理模拟数据集上实现了更长时间的准确预测，比现有方法延长了50%的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型性能和可扩展性的启发，将Transformer架构应用于视频预测领域，特别关注物理模拟的时间因果建模这一现有视频生成方法的常见短板。

Method: 使用纯Transformer模型进行自回归视频预测，采用连续像素空间表示，比较不同的时空自注意力布局，通过物理对象跟踪指标和物理模拟数据集的无监督训练来隔离时空推理能力。

Result: 无需复杂训练策略或潜在特征学习组件，就能显著延长物理准确预测的时间范围达50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持可比性能。通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数，且能泛化到分布外参数。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一个基于物理引导的自监督高光谱超分辨率框架，通过解混瓶颈实现高光谱与多光谱图像融合，具有可解释性且对少波段多光谱图像鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖不透明的回归器，缺乏可解释性，且在MSI波段很少时容易失效。需要开发既保持高性能又具有可解释性的融合方法。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用紧凑MLP从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，使用MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行自监督训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph始终优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与有监督基线方法性能相当，训练时间不到1分钟。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph框架通过物理引导的解混方法实现了高性能、可解释且鲁棒的高光谱超分辨率，特别适用于少波段MSI场景。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM)，一个基于潜在变量扩展的通用模态转换框架，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的桥梁，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面仍面临挑战。现有方法依赖限制性假设，如共享维度、高斯源先验和模态特定架构，限制了其通用性和理论基础。

Method: 在共享潜在空间中操作，引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性，设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构用于潜在空间噪声预测，并提出预测损失指导跨域转换训练。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务上表现优异，包括多视图到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视图场景合成，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LDDBM建立了一个强大的通用模态转换基线，支持任意模态对，为跨模态生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制，解决了现有模型在空间构图控制和多主体扩展方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏对空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。为了解决这些限制，需要开发能够提供直观空间控制和多主体处理能力的框架。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体放在独立层中实现无遮挡组合；提出锁定机制，保持选定层的高保真度，同时允许其他层灵活适应周围环境；结合位置嵌入和互补数据采样策略，无需架构修改。

Result: 实验表明，LayerComposer在多主体个性化图像生成中实现了卓越的空间控制和身份保持，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过分层画布和锁定机制，为多主体个性化图像生成提供了有效的交互式空间控制解决方案，类似于专业图像编辑软件的直观操作体验。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，能够生成具有全局一致性的多镜头叙事场景，解决了现有模型在叙事连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型擅长生成单个片段，但在创建连贯的多镜头叙事方面存在"叙事鸿沟"，无法满足电影叙事的需求。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，同时使用稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集、镜头间稀疏）确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆能力以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC是一个基于Transformer的模型，用于自动分类在线科学学习讨论中的知识建构水平，在YouTube科学频道评论数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够自动分析在线科学学习环境中知识建构水平的工具，以支持大规模的教育话语分析和认知参与评估。

Method: 扩展DeBERTa-v3模型，结合Focal Loss、Label Smoothing和R-Drop正则化技术来处理类别不平衡并增强泛化能力，构建了端到端的可复现流程。

Result: 在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC取得了0.836±0.008的宏F1分数，显著优于传统和Transformer基线模型，对高阶认知参与类别表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识建构的细微指标，为话语分析和认知参与评估的自动化工具开发提供了可扩展的理论驱动方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了五个主流大语言模型生成高中物理课程计划的质量，发现模型选择主要影响可读性，而提示框架结构对事实准确性和教学完整性影响更大。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE提示框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI生成课程计划的教学合理性和可用性，比较不同大语言模型和提示框架在生成物理课程计划方面的表现。

Method: 使用五个大语言模型和三种提示框架生成15个高中物理课程计划，通过四个自动化计算指标进行分析：可读性、事实准确性、课程标准对齐和认知需求。

Result: DeepSeek生成最易读的教学计划，Claude语言最密集；RACE框架产生最低的幻觉指数和最高的课程标准对齐；所有模型的学习目标主要集中在布鲁姆分类法的低阶层次。

Conclusion: 可读性主要由模型设计决定，而教学可靠性和课程对齐更依赖于提示框架。最佳配置是结合可读性优化的模型与RACE框架及明确的概念清单。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

TL;DR: ReDiff是一个改进的离散扩散模型框架，通过主动修正而非被动去噪来解决训练-推理差异导致的错误级联问题，显著提升了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在视觉语言任务中面临训练-推理差异的挑战，初始token错误在并行解码时会污染生成上下文，引发错误级联，导致语法错误和语义幻觉。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：1) 训练模型修正合成错误以建立基础修正能力；2) 实施在线自修正循环，模型学习从专家修正中修正自己的错误草稿。

Result: ReDiff显著提高了生成内容的连贯性和事实准确性，实现了比传统去噪方法更稳定高效的并行生成。

Conclusion: 通过将生成过程重新定义为主动修正而非被动去噪，ReDiff有效打破了错误级联，为离散扩散模型的实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出Sparse Tracing技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长上下文注意力模式，解决了传统方法在百万token上下文下内存需求过高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展到百万token上下文，传统注意力分析技术因二次方复杂度需要TB级内存，无法处理超过10万token的上下文。

Method: 引入Stream算法，采用可编译的分层剪枝方法，在近线性时间O(T log T)和线性空间O(T)内估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码，通过二分搜索式精化保留每个查询的前k个关键块。

Result: 在长思维链推理轨迹中识别思维锚点，剪枝97-99%的token交互；在RULER基准测试中保留关键检索路径，剪枝90-96%交互，暴露从针到输出的分层路径。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing为分析注意力模式和追踪信息流提供了实用的即插即用工具，使长上下文可解释性在消费级GPU上可行，有助于民主化思维链监控。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

Motivation: HIV的高效筛查和早期诊断对于减少传播至关重要。虽然大规模实验室检测不可行，但电子健康记录的普及为解决这一挑战提供了新机会。现有研究主要关注结构化数据，而忽视了临床笔记等非结构化文本数据中可能包含的HIV风险相关信息。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的流程，利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，评估患者进行HIV进一步检测的资格。

Result: 在伊拉斯姆斯大学医学中心鹿特丹分校的临床数据上进行实验，结果显示该流程实现了高准确率，同时保持了较低的假阴性率。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了利用大型语言模型分析电子健康记录非结构化文本在HIV筛查中的有效性，为早期诊断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

TL;DR: 本研究首次对大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现进行了专家基准测试，评估了11个通用LLM在22个LCA相关任务上的表现。专家发现37%的响应包含不准确信息，幻觉率高达40%，但较小模型在准确性和解释质量方面表现良好，开源模型与闭源模型表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大型语言模型越来越多地被用于支持生命周期评估，但缺乏对其可靠性、鲁棒性和可用性的系统性证据。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为LCA领域提供首个基于专家评估的LLM基准测试。

Method: 评估了11个通用LLM（包括商业和开源模型）在22个LCA相关任务上的表现。17位经验丰富的从业者根据科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性、可验证性和指令遵循等标准审查模型输出，共收集168份专家评审。

Result: 专家判定37%的响应包含不准确或误导性信息。准确性和解释质量评分普遍为平均或良好，格式遵循评分较高。幻觉率差异显著，某些模型的幻觉引用率高达40%。开源模型在准确性和解释质量等标准上与闭源模型表现相当或更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LCA中简单应用LLM的风险（如将其视为自由形式的神谕），同时也显示了其在解释质量和减轻简单任务劳动强度方面的益处。没有基础机制支持的通用LLM使用存在风险。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型评估存在静态基准测试无法综合评估、人工或模型对比主观性强、成本高且容易被模型利用表面特征（如冗长性）来提升胜率等问题。

Method: 采用游戏化评估方法，具体通过Dixit幻想卡牌游戏实现，玩家需要为卡片生成能够欺骗部分但非全部玩家的描述，从而综合测试模型的多项能力。

Result: 对五个多模态大语言模型的定量实验显示，Dixit胜率排名与流行基准测试排名完全一致，同时人机对战揭示了模型策略与人类策略的差异以及模型推理能力的改进空间。

Conclusion: 游戏化评估为多模态大语言模型提供了更全面、客观和有趣的评估框架，能够有效解决传统评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆增强的LLM代理框架，通过存储实例级批评和语义级指导来提升分类性能，无需参数更新即可实现24.8%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法成本高、灵活性差且不透明，需要探索无需参数更新的学习方式，使LLM代理能够从标注示例中学习目标分类函数。

Method: 使用记忆增强框架，包含实例级批评的片段记忆和可重用任务指导的语义记忆，结合标注数据和LLM生成的批评进行学习。

Result: 在多样化任务中，相比仅依赖标签的检索式基线，整合批评可带来最高24.8%的准确率提升，并揭示了OpenAI与开源模型在处理事实导向与偏好数据时的行为差异。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的反思式学习为构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM代理提供了前景，模型特性和记忆策略共同塑造学习动态。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR是一个无监督可控歌词翻译框架，通过难度感知课程设计和自适应课程策略，在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上取得SOTA结果，训练步骤减少近40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌词翻译方法依赖手工规则和句子级建模，难以内化音乐-语言模式，在段落级别缺乏跨行连贯性和全局韵律。

Method: 提出LyriCAR框架，包含难度感知课程设计师和自适应课程策略，以无监督方式逐步引导模型学习复杂挑战。

Result: 在EN-ZH歌词翻译任务上，LyriCAR在标准翻译指标和多维奖励分数上均达到SOTA，自适应课程策略减少近40%训练步骤。

Conclusion: LyriCAR通过课程学习有效提升歌词翻译质量，证明了自适应课程策略在加速收敛和改善翻译性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉和输出结构不一致的问题，而符号NLU系统虽然能提供可解释的结构化表示，但覆盖范围有限且需要专业知识维护。希望通过混合方法结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用LLM进行重述和文本简化以提供广泛覆盖，并作为信息源填补知识空白；使用符号NLU生成可用于推理和增量学习的结构化关系表示。

Result: 在从常识科学文本中提取和解释数量及因果规律的任务上，混合方法显著优于纯符号方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了LLM的广泛覆盖能力和符号NLU的结构化表示优势，在特定任务上取得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Motivation: 模拟人脑解析语言的方式，开发一种能够逐词实时构建依赖关系的解析算法，与传统的短语结构解析方法形成对比。

Method: 采用逐词处理策略，每个单词在能够被附加时立即附加到依赖树中，算法的最坏情况复杂度为O(n³)。

Conclusion: 该依赖解析算法模拟了人脑的解析过程，具有与短语结构解析相同的理论复杂度，但在实际应用中表现更优。

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗数据集（如MedQA）过于简化，不能充分代表真实世界的临床决策过程，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出基于临床背景和临床问题两个维度的统一范式，总结现有数据集设置，回顾训练时和测试时技术，并扩展评估维度。

Result: 建立了一个能够澄清假设、标准化比较并指导开发具有临床意义的LLM的评估框架。

Conclusion: 该范式有助于更准确地评估LLM在临床决策中的表现，推动开发更具临床意义的语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了希腊嵌入模型(GEM)，这是一个针对希腊语的新系列Transformer模型，通过精心策划的大规模语料库训练，在希腊语NLP任务中显著超越现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希腊语等形态丰富的中等资源语言在NLP发展中面临研究分散、架构单一和上下文长度受限的问题，特别是在法律等专业领域，现有模型通常局限于早期Transformer架构和512个token的窗口，无法处理长法律文档。

Method: 构建大规模希腊语语料库，采用严格的质量驱动过滤和预处理方法；预训练并系统评估多种现代架构（ELECTRA、ConvBERT、ModernBERT）；提出首个面向法律领域的希腊-英语双语嵌入模型。

Result: 实验表明，GEM-RoBERTa和GEM-ConvBERT模型在下游任务中显著优于现有基线，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过质量驱动的数据策划和多样化的现代架构应用，成功提升了希腊语NLP性能，特别是在法律领域的长文档处理能力。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练语言模型在序列标注任务中的迁移学习效果仍有提升空间，特别是在领域迁移、信息流动和生成式应用方面存在局限性。

Method: 1) 多任务模型结合领域无关文本处理系统的额外信号；2) 修改自回归大语言模型架构实现层间双向信息流；3) 生成式监督上下文微调框架结合响应导向适应策略。

Result: 提出的模型、方法和框架证明，通过针对性迁移学习范式适应的预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中能达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标注任务中的性能可以通过特定的迁移学习改进策略得到显著提升，特别是在领域适应、架构优化和生成式应用方面。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界工具集中存在冗余工具，工具名称和描述重叠导致歧义，降低选择准确性；同时LLM面临严格的输入上下文限制，无法有效处理大型工具集。

Method: 提出ToolScope系统：(1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction自动审核和修复工具合并，减少冗余；(2) ToolScopeRetriever对每个查询进行工具排序和选择，压缩工具集以适应上下文限制。

Result: 在三个最先进的LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试中，工具选择准确率提升了8.38%至38.6%。

Conclusion: ToolScope能有效增强LLM工具使用能力，解决工具冗余和上下文限制问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

Motivation: 提升小语言模型在波斯语等资源稀缺语言中的推理能力，特别是针对医学问答等专业应用场景

Method: 采用强化学习与AI反馈(RLAIF)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，翻译医学问答数据集，生成包含正确和错误推理轨迹的答案对，训练模型产生链式思维推理

Result: 训练后的模型在仅使用200万token偏好答案和250万token拒绝答案的情况下，超越了基于5700万token训练的gaokerena-V模型

Conclusion: 推理导向的训练方法在数据有限的情况下，能够高效开发特定领域的语言模型

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了CreativityPrism框架，将创造力分解为质量、新颖性和多样性三个维度，用于评估大语言模型在不同任务和领域中的创造力表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型创造力评估方法碎片化，缺乏统一框架，主要原因是创造力的定义和测量标准在不同领域和任务中存在显著差异。

Method: 构建CreativityPrism框架，包含发散思维、创意写作和逻辑推理三个领域，九个任务，以及二十个评估指标，分别测量创造力的三个维度。评估了17个最先进的专有和开源大语言模型。

Result: 专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；同一领域内任务表现高度相关，不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标强相关，新颖性与其他维度相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 创造力评估需要整体性方法，单一任务或维度的优异表现不能推广到其他方面，支持了创造力不是单一固定概念的观点。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法依赖大量标注数据和模型微调，而现有的少样本方法虽然减少了训练需求，但LLM推理成本高昂且效率低下。

Method: ARTER采用结构化流水线，通过计算互补信号将上下文提及分类为简单和困难案例，分别由低计算成本的实体链接器和选择性LLM推理处理。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ARTER在6个数据集中的5个上平均提升2.53%，最高提升4.47%，性能与全LLM推理相当但效率提升一倍。

Conclusion: ARTER证明了通过智能路由和选择性使用LLM推理，可以在不牺牲性能的前提下显著提高实体链接的效率。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

TL;DR: BoundRL是一种新颖高效的文本分割方法，通过生成起始标记序列来重构完整内容，大幅降低推理成本并减少幻觉，特别适用于处理包含表格、代码片段等复杂元素的结构化文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着结构化文本在技术报告和生成式AI提示等领域的复杂性增加，传统基于句子或段落的分割方法无法有效处理包含表格、代码片段等非纯文本元素，需要更有效的语义分割方法。

Method: BoundRL联合执行标记级文本分割和标签预测，通过生成起始标记序列而非完整内容来重构文本。采用带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）优化文档重构保真度和语义对齐，并通过系统扰动生成序列构建中间候选来缓解熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明，BoundRL使小型语言模型（1.7B参数）在复杂LLM应用提示的分割任务上优于大型模型的少样本提示。RLVR相比监督微调有显著改进，加入中间候选进一步提升了性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: BoundRL为处理复杂结构化文本提供了一种高效的分割解决方案，通过创新的起始标记生成和强化学习方法，在保持高质量的同时大幅降低了计算成本。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

### [107] [Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20154)
*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在立场检测任务中的偏见问题，发现模型存在显著的刻板印象，如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非裔美国人方言与反对特朗普关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从预训练数据中继承了刻板印象，导致在自然语言处理任务中对某些社会群体产生偏见行为。然而，立场检测方法中的这种偏见评估在社区中被很大程度上忽视了。

Method: 通过自动标注现有立场检测数据集中的帖子，使用两个属性：特定群体的方言或语言风格，以及文本复杂度/可读性，研究这些属性是否影响模型的立场检测决策。

Result: 结果显示，LLMs在立场检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂度关联，将非洲美国方言与反对唐纳德·特朗普关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在零样本立场检测设置中存在显著的偏见问题，需要进一步研究和解决这些刻板印象问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch是首个专门评估智能代理在信息搜索中整合深度推理和广度信息收集能力的基准测试，包含220个跨15个领域的问题，现有最先进代理仅能达到2.39%的平均成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前搜索代理缺乏同时进行深度多跳推理和广度信息收集的能力，这在真实世界应用（如市场分析和商业开发）中是一个关键缺陷。

Method: 通过转换现有数据集的方法，构建了包含220个问题的基准测试，这些问题需要处理大量数据并进行深度多跳检索推理。

Result: 实验表明，即使最先进的代理在DeepWideSearch上也仅能达到2.39%的平均成功率，揭示了深度和广度搜索整合的挑战。错误分析识别出四种失败模式：缺乏反思、过度依赖内部知识、检索不足和上下文溢出。

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch基准测试公开发布，旨在推动更强大和鲁棒的信息搜索代理的研究，暴露了当前代理架构的关键局限性。

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: 提出了Mixture-of-Minds多智能体框架，将表格推理分解为规划、编码和回答三个专门角色，结合代码执行实现精确表格操作，并通过MCTS和强化学习进行自我改进训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格理解方法存在局限性：基于微调的方法容易产生算术错误和幻觉，而基于工具的方法缺乏语义理解且依赖刚性模式。需要整合强大推理能力和可靠表格处理的方法。

Method: 使用多智能体框架将表格推理分解为三个专门角色（规划、编码、回答），结合代码执行进行精确表格操作，并采用MCTS生成伪黄金轨迹和强化学习优化智能体。

Result: 在TableBench上达到62.13%的准确率，超越了OpenAI-o4-mini-high，显示出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合结构化多智能体工作流程与强化学习，为表格理解提供了有前景的解决方案，证明了该方法在整合推理能力和表格处理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过五个空间推理任务测试大语言模型的空间理解能力，发现模型在小规模任务中表现尚可，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能急剧下降，平均准确率下降42.7%，最高达84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在文本输入上的空间推理能力，评估其从简单模式识别到抽象空间推理的扩展能力。

Method: 使用五个任务测试LLMs：象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和瓷砖滑动，通过增加网格维度来提升任务复杂度。

Result: LLMs在所有小规模任务中表现中等，但随着规模增加性能急剧恶化，所有初始准确率超过50%的任务都至少损失48%的准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在语言和空间推理之间存在明显差距，其底层架构缺乏稳健的空间表征能力，这为未来语言与几何交叉领域的基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解码无关的采样策略，用于近似计算语言模型对文本所有可能分词方式的概率边际化，相比传统采样方法大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型评估只考虑特定分词方式的概率，但实际上同一文本有多种分词可能。边际化评估更准确但计算昂贵，现有采样方法需要昂贵的生成步骤。

Method: 提出解码无关的采样策略，不依赖模型生成，仅使用廉价的分词采样方法，这些策略与模型和分词器无关。

Result: 实验表明解码无关采样策略在多个开源模型上能提供足够准确的边际估计，且运行时间成本仅为传统方法的一小部分。

Conclusion: 解码无关采样策略是实现高效文本概率边际化的可行方法，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个三模态情感严重程度框架，通过融合文本、音频和面部信号来评估抑郁症和PTSD的严重程度，在DAIC数据集上优于单模态基线，提高了决策效用和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和PTSD经常共病且症状相互关联，但现有的自动化评估通常是二分类且针对单一障碍。临床诊断需要能够评估严重程度的跨障碍估计和决策支持解释。

Method: 开发了统一的三模态情感严重程度框架，同步融合：1）访谈文本（句子级transformer嵌入）；2）音频（log Mel统计特征和delta）；3）面部信号（动作单元、注视、头部和姿态描述符）。使用校准的后期融合分类器输出抑郁症（PHQ-8；5类）和PTSD（3类）的严重程度概率及特征级归因。

Result: 在DAIC数据集上的分层交叉验证显示：融合模型在准确率和加权F1上与最强单模态基线相当，同时提高了决策曲线效用和噪声/缺失模态下的鲁棒性。对于PTSD，融合减少了回归误差并提高了类别一致性。错误主要发生在相邻严重程度之间，极端类别识别可靠。消融实验表明文本对抑郁症严重程度贡献最大，音频和面部线索对PTSD至关重要。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床医生在环支持，能够可靠识别极端严重程度类别，归因结果与语言和行为标记一致。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

TL;DR: ContextLM框架通过引入next-context预测目标来增强标准预训练，克服了传统next-token预测在捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统next-token预测限制了模型捕捉高级语义结构和长距离上下文关系的能力，需要改进以提升语言模型性能。

Method: 在标准预训练基础上添加next-context预测目标，训练模型学习多token上下文的预测表示，利用未来token块的错误信号，同时保持与标准自回归评估范式的完全兼容。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型家族上的实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务性能上均带来一致改进，最高扩展到15亿参数规模。

Conclusion: next-context预测为更强的语言建模提供了可扩展且高效的途径，能够以最小计算开销实现更好的长距离连贯性和更有效的注意力分配。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 该论文提出区分引用失败和响应失败，引入CITECONTROL基准分析引用失败模式，并提出CITENTION框架来改进LLM引用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based RAG系统的引用机制在模型生成有用响应但未能完整引用证据时存在引用失败问题，需要与响应失败区分开来解决。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 研究引用失败发生条件，引入CITECONTROL基准分析响应与证据关系对引用质量的影响；2) 提出CITENTION框架，集成生成式、基于注意力和基于检索的方法来改进引用。

Result: 实验表明失败率随关系复杂性增加而上升，CITENTION框架在CITECONTROL基准和迁移设置中显著提升了引用性能。

Conclusion: 通过区分引用失败与响应失败，并开发专门的基准和集成框架，可以有效解决LLM引用问题，提高RAG系统的可信度。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程奖励模型在数学等复杂推理任务中表现良好，但在涉及半结构化数据的表格问答任务中的应用尚未探索。表格问答存在信息冗余、推理步骤松散和领域特定推理等独特挑战。

Method: 从答案和步骤两个角度评估最先进的生成式过程奖励模型在表格问答任务上的表现，分析文本和代码验证的组合效果。

Result: 结果显示，结合文本和代码验证的PRM有助于解决方案选择，但在跨域数据上泛化能力不足。步骤级验证性能与答案准确性之间相关性较弱，可能源于步骤依赖关系弱和因果联系松散。

Conclusion: 当前过程奖励模型在表格问答任务中存在局限性，这些发现为构建更鲁棒的过程感知验证器提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了大型推理模型与代码解释器集成时的冲突问题，显著提升了数学推理性能和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在表格推理任务中的表现可能部分源于对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的泛化能力，特别是当数据集包含强语义线索时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在结构化数据上的推理能力时，往往忽略了数据集污染这一关键混淆因素，需要探究LLMs是否对广泛使用的表格基准数据集存在先验知识。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，比较LLMs在包含强语义线索的数据集与去除或随机化语义线索的数据集上的表现差异。

Result: 当数据集包含有意义的列名或可解释的值类别等强语义线索时，LLMs表现出污染效应；但当这些线索被移除或随机化后，性能急剧下降至接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs在表格推理任务中表现出的能力可能反映了对公开数据集的记忆而非真正的推理能力，需要改进评估协议以区分语义泄漏和真实推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Motivation: 现有分块方法依赖静态边界识别，采用固定粒度范式，限制了其对多样化查询需求的适应性。

Method: 将句子视为原子单元，从静态分块分割转向支持任意句子组合的灵活检索，减少语义边界检测的计算开销。

Result: 在LongBench V2上的实验评估显示，FreeChunker相比传统分块方法实现了更优的检索性能，同时在计算效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeChunker通过范式转变显著提升了RAG系统的检索性能和计算效率，为分块策略提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探究仅使用对话数据进行预训练是否能产生在形式和功能上都适合的小型语言模型，以及如何通过微调策略使模型生成更具交流性的文本。

Method: 基于对话数据预训练的llamalogue模型，采用多种微调策略（包括PPO和DPO）来增强模型的交流能力。

Result: 模型在大多数标准BabyLM基准测试中表现不佳，但在最小对设置下的对话延续预测方面表现优异；PPO微调效果不一甚至有害，而DPO微调能进一步提升自定义对话基准的性能。

Conclusion: 对话专用预训练能产生对话能力强的模型，但通用能力有限；DPO是比PPO更有效的对话优化方法。

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in

llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue

Motivation: 探索否定文本对LLMs幻觉检测的影响，填补该领域的研究空白，解决三个重要但尚未回答的研究问题。

Method: 通过重构现有幻觉检测数据集创建NegHalu数据集，在否定文本上测试LLMs的幻觉检测能力，并在token级别追踪LLMs处理否定输入时的内部状态。

Conclusion: 否定文本显著影响LLMs的幻觉检测能力，需要进一步研究来缓解这种负面影响，提高模型在处理否定表达时的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

TL;DR: 提出了NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual两种专注于希伯来语文本的BERT风格模型，在希伯来语基准测试中表现优异，特别是在检索任务上超越同类多语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT模型虽然性能优秀但架构已过时，需要基于新架构开发专门针对希伯来语的高性能模型。

Method: 采用与NeoBERT相同的架构训练BERT风格模型，专门针对希伯来语文本进行训练。

Result: 新模型在几乎所有希伯来语基准测试中超越现有模型，双语模型在检索任务上表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 成功开发了针对希伯来语的先进BERT模型，为希伯来语NLP研究和应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat是一个教师-学生框架，通过后训练提升BabyLM在多轮对话中的连续性，使生成回复更加语法正确和连贯。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童与照顾者之间的多轮对话具有连续性特征，即对话者之间及时、直接且有意义的交流。现有BabyLM在这方面存在不足，需要改进多轮对话的连续性。

Method: 使用新颖的对齐数据集进行后训练，采用教师-学生框架，并实验了自适应教师解码策略。

Result: BabyLM生成的回复更加语法正确和连贯，但自适应教师解码策略带来的额外增益有限。

Conclusion: ContingentChat展示了针对性后训练对对话质量的益处，同时表明连续性对于BabyLM来说仍然是一个具有挑战性的目标。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了指令蒸馏任务，将低质量冗余指令数据转化为高质量指令-输出对，通过LM-Mixup方法有效增强不完美数据集，仅使用3%数据就能超越全数据集训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量指令数据稀缺而低质量数据被大量丢弃的问题，充分利用低质量数据资源提升LLM指令调优效率。

Method: 构建MIXTURE数据集，提出LM-Mixup方法：先在MIXTURE上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习优化，使用质量、语义对齐和格式合规三个奖励信号进行GRPO优化。

Result: 仅使用约3%的蒸馏数据微调LLM，不仅超越全数据集训练效果，还能与最先进的高质量数据选择方法竞争。

Conclusion: 低质量数据经过适当蒸馏和LM-Mixup增强后是宝贵资源，能显著提升指令调优LLM的效率和性能。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出存在不确定性和正确性差异，实际可靠性无法保证，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 在四个问答任务上使用最先进的开源LLM，系统评估四种置信度估计方法：VCE、MSP、样本一致性和CoCoA。

Result: 每种不确定性指标捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合CoCoA方法在整体可靠性方面表现最好，提高了校准和正确答案的区分度。

Conclusion: 讨论了每种方法的权衡，并为LLM应用中不确定性度量的选择提供了建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在持续学习中面临的历史数据不可用问题，以及传统方法需要任务标签或导致性能权衡的局限性。

Method: 通过聚类典型样本计算层间隐藏表征的模型间相似度，执行自适应分层参数融合，在浅层保留领域通用特征，在深层允许任务特定适应。

Result: 在五个NLP任务和多种持续学习场景中，RECALL在知识保留和泛化能力方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RECALL提供了一个可扩展且无需数据的解决方案，用于不断演进的大语言模型，实现了无缝多领域集成和强大的抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

TL;DR: 通过向LLM的激活状态添加引导向量，可以抑制模型对评估环境的感知，使其在评估时表现得像在部署环境中一样，从而提高安全性评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型有时能检测到它们正在被评估，并调整行为以显得更加对齐，这会损害安全性评估的可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：首先在包含模型事实描述的文档上进行持续预训练，然后通过专家迭代训练模型在评估环境中使用Python类型提示。最后使用原始模型的激活状态构建引导向量来抑制评估感知。

Result: 经过训练的模型在评估环境中表现出评估感知行为，但通过激活引导可以消除这种差异，使模型在评估时表现得像在部署环境中。

Conclusion: AI评估者可以通过引导模型使其在评估时表现得像在部署环境中，从而提高安全性评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Robust Preference Selection (RPS)方法，通过方向性邻域共识来增强语言模型对多样化人类偏好的鲁棒性，无需重新训练即可处理训练数据中未充分覆盖的偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型对齐方法主要反映训练数据中的主流偏好，但在处理偏离中心趋势的特定、个体化偏好时表现不佳，存在偏好覆盖差距问题。

Method: RPS是一种无需训练的后处理方法，通过在相关偏好邻域中采样多个响应来创建候选池，然后选择与用户原始意图最匹配的响应。

Result: 在三种对齐范式(DPA、DPO、SFT)上的实验表明，RPS相比基线方法显著提升了鲁棒性，在未充分覆盖的偏好区域上达到69%的胜率。

Conclusion: RPS提供了一个实用且理论基础的解决方案，能够有效增强偏好对齐模型的可靠性，无需模型重新训练。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HSEQ分层序列迭代框架，统一处理多模态证据源（文本、表格、知识图谱），通过结构感知的迭代收集足够证据进行答案合成，在多个QA数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在处理多步骤问题和异构证据源时存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和资源预算之间进行权衡。

Method: 将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆的分层序列，通过头代理指导检索，迭代代理执行结构感知操作（如父子跳转、表格行列邻居、KG关系），最后合成规范化证据生成答案。

Result: 在HotpotQA、HybridQA/TAT-QA和MetaQA等数据集上的实验显示，相比单次传递、多跳和基于代理的RAG基线，HSEQ在EM/F1指标上获得一致提升，且具有高效率。

Conclusion: HSEQ框架具有三个关键优势：格式无关的统一处理、预算感知的引导迭代、证据规范化，能够在不牺牲准确性的同时减少不必要的资源消耗。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

Result: 观察到系统差异：左翼、中间和右翼主流党派的翻译质量优于边缘党派

Conclusion: 多语言翻译质量分析为评估LLM政治偏见提供了新的有效视角

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

TL;DR: 提出ARC-Encoder，一种可适应文本表示压缩器，通过将上下文压缩为连续表示来替换解码器LLM中的token嵌入，实现4-8倍压缩比，在保持性能的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成和思维链推理等技术导致上下文变长和推理成本增加，现有上下文压缩方法需要微调目标模型或修改架构，这会降低模型的通用能力。

Method: 系统研究编码器训练策略和架构选择，设计ARC-Encoder，将上下文压缩为更少的连续表示，可适配多个解码器LLM。

Result: ARC-Encoder在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时提高推理计算效率，单个编码器可适应多个解码器LLM。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是灵活高效的便携式编码器解决方案，可与多个LLM无缝协作。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench是一个包含9720个理解问题的数据集，专门测试语言模型对中心嵌套句的结构理解能力，通过对比语义合理与不合理的句子来区分模型是进行句法分析还是语义模式匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够区分语言模型是真正理解句法结构还是仅依赖语义模式匹配的方法，需要开发新的评估框架来量化模型的结构理解能力。

Method: 创建CenterBench数据集，包含中心嵌套句及其语义不合理对照句，通过6种理解问题测试表面理解、句法依赖和因果推理能力，测试了6个模型。

Result: 模型在合理与不合理句子间的性能差距随复杂度增加而系统性扩大（中位数差距达26.8个百分点），表明模型在高复杂度时会放弃结构分析而依赖语义关联。语义合理性在因果推理问题上反而损害性能。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了首个识别模型从结构分析转向模式匹配的框架，揭示了模型在高复杂度下对语义关联的过度依赖，而人类则表现出可变的语义效应。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

TL;DR: GlobalRAG是一个强化学习框架，通过分解问题为子目标、协调检索与推理、迭代优化证据来增强多跳问答中的全局推理能力，仅用8k训练数据就在多个基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在多跳问答中存在两个基本限制：(i)缺乏全局规划来构建多步推理结构，(ii)执行不可靠，影响有效查询制定和检索证据的一致性使用。

Method: 提出GlobalRAG框架，包含问题分解为子目标、检索与推理协调、证据迭代优化。引入规划质量奖励和子目标完成奖励来指导过程，采用渐进权重退火策略平衡过程导向和结果导向目标。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，GlobalRAG显著优于强基线方法，仅使用8k训练数据（基线方法训练数据的42%），在EM和F1指标上平均提升14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过强化学习有效解决了多跳问答中的全局规划和执行可靠性问题，在少样本设置下实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估ChatGPT在沟通数据编码中是否存在性别和种族偏见，发现在协作问题解决任务中无显著偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模评估沟通协作需要人工编码沟通数据，虽然ChatGPT能直接按编码规则进行编码且准确率接近人类评分者，但其是否存在对性别和种族等人口群体的偏见尚不明确。

Method: 使用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析三种协作任务（谈判、问题解决、决策制定）的数据，检验ChatGPT编码在不同性别和种族群体间的差异。

Result: ChatGPT编码在性别和种族群体间未表现出显著偏见。

Conclusion: ChatGPT编码无显著人口偏见，为其在大规模协作沟通评估中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

TL;DR: 本文基于人类好奇心评估问卷5DCR设计了一个综合评估框架，评估大语言模型的好奇心表现，发现LLMs比人类更渴望知识但在不确定环境中趋于保守，好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否具备类似人类的好奇心驱动学习能力，从人类好奇心评估问卷出发设计评估框架。

Method: 基于五维好奇心量表修订版(5DCR)设计综合评估框架，涵盖信息寻求、刺激寻求、社交好奇心等维度来评估LLMs的好奇心表现。

Result: LLMs表现出比人类更强的知识渴求，但在不确定环境中趋于保守；好奇行为能增强模型的推理和主动学习能力。

Conclusion: LLMs有潜力展现类似人类的好奇心，为未来LLMs学习能力和创新研究的发展提供实验支持。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

TL;DR: LRMs在非英语问题上倾向于使用英语推理，这导致认知行为表现更好且准确率更高，但存在翻译错误风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型的多语言推理能力，关注其在非英语问题上的表现和潜在问题。

Method: 在MGSM和GPQA Diamond任务上系统比较模型在英语和问题语言中的推理表现，分析认知属性和准确性。

Result: 英语推理的认知行为更丰富，准确率更高，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能差距扩大；英语推理易受翻译错误影响。

Conclusion: LRMs存在英语中心化倾向，虽然能提高性能但存在翻译风险，需要平衡多语言推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决粤语资源匮乏问题，缺乏评估框架，需要为粤语自然语言理解建立基准测试。

Method: 创建CantoNLU基准测试，包含7个NLU任务；比较四种模型：未经粤语训练的普通话模型、粤语适应模型（在普通话模型上继续训练）、从头训练的粤语单语模型。

Result: 粤语适应模型整体表现最佳；单语模型在句法任务上表现更好；普通话模型在某些场景下仍有竞争力。

Conclusion: 当粤语领域数据稀缺时，直接迁移可能足够；发布了所有数据集、代码和模型权重以促进粤语NLP研究。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

TL;DR: 提出神经多样性作为减少语言模型幻觉的新机制，通过解相关的并行表示在不增加参数和数据的情况下显著降低幻觉率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在参数、计算和数据增加的情况下仍然存在幻觉问题，需要寻找新的解决方案

Method: 提出ND-LoRA（神经多样性低秩适应），结合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，实现解相关的并行表示

Result: ND-LoRA将幻觉率降低高达25.6%（平均14.6%），且不降低总体准确性；神经相关性增加0.1%与幻觉率增加3.8%相关

Conclusion: 神经多样性是提升语言模型可靠性的第三个扩展维度，与参数和数据正交，可在固定预算下改善模型性能

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

TL;DR: 本文针对MBR解码在开放任务中的局限性，提出了三种轻量级适配方法，通过增强对结果空间结构变化的敏感性来提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码在机器翻译中有效，但在对话或指令跟随等开放任务中可能失效，因为标准相似性效用函数会选择模型分布中广泛代表性但结构上欠优的响应。

Method: 提出三种轻量级效用函数适配方法，增强MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性。构建包含对话行为、情感和响应结构的数据集，并提出两个结构最优性评估指标。

Result: 分析表明标准相似性效用函数在结构最优性指标上表现不佳，而提出的适配方法显著改善了结构最优性。在AlpacaEval和MT-Bench基准测试中，结构敏感性增强使生成质量提升达13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 增强MBR对结构变化的敏感性是提升开放任务生成质量的有效策略，提出的轻量级适配方法在保持MBR优势的同时显著改善了结构最优性。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过用户调查发现，在隐私敏感场景中，用户对LLM回复的隐私保护质量和帮助性评价存在显著个体差异，而代理LLM评估与用户感知相关性很低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM隐私评估主要依赖代理LLM来评估隐私规范合规性，忽视了真实用户的感知，且主要关注隐私保护质量而未深入调查帮助性的细微差异。

Method: 对94名参与者使用PrivacyLens中的90个场景进行用户研究，比较用户评估与5个代理LLM评估的一致性。

Result: 用户对相同场景的相同回复在隐私保护质量和帮助性方面评价一致性低，而代理LLM之间一致性高但与用户评估相关性低。

Conclusion: LLM回复的隐私和帮助性具有个体特异性，代理LLM无法准确估计用户感知，需要进行以用户为中心的研究来改进代理LLM与用户的对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

TL;DR: 开发并评估了多种NLP方法从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现基于大语言模型的方法表现最佳，特别是错误分析提示达到了F1=1.000的完美分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氟嘧啶类药物广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌治疗，但会引发手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。由于毒性信息通常嵌入在临床笔记中，需要开发有效的NLP方法来提取这些信息。

Method: 构建了包含236份临床笔记的金标准数据集，开发了基于规则、机器学习（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归）、深度学习（BERT、ClinicalBERT）和大语言模型（零样本提示和错误分析提示）的NLP方法，使用80:20的训练测试分割。

Result: 错误分析提示在治疗和毒性提取方面取得了最优的精确率、召回率和F1分数（F1=1.000），零样本提示在治疗提取上达到F1=1.000，毒性提取达到F1=0.876。逻辑回归和SVM在毒性提取方面排名第二（F1=0.937）。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，在肿瘤学研究和药物警戒方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了大型推理模型作为机器翻译评估器的潜力，发现其存在评估材料需求特殊、对简单实例过度思考以及评分机制导致高估等问题，并提出通过训练合成的人类思维轨迹来校准模型思维，显著降低了思考成本并提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂任务中通过中间"思考"过程提升推理能力，但其在机器翻译质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，因此需要系统分析LRM作为评估器的可行性。

Method: 提出通过训练LRM在合成的人类思维轨迹上进行校准，以解决其过度思考和评分高估问题，并在WMT24 Metrics基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明该方法将思考预算降低了约35倍，同时在不同规模的LRM（7B到32B）上提升了评估性能，例如R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型的相关性提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 有效校准的大型推理模型有潜力推进细粒度自动机器翻译评估的发展，展示了LRM在MT评估中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM的方法主要关注文本生成等高级任务，没有针对特定AI应用，无法充分评估负责任AI维度如公平性，因为不同应用中受保护属性的相关性不同。

Method: 构建基于真实应用（根据产品特征生成纯文本产品描述）的数据集，通过公平性属性与性别化形容词、产品类别的交叉参数化，生成带标签的提示集合。

Result: 展示了如何使用该数据识别LLM在质量、真实性、安全性和公平性方面的差距。

Conclusion: 为研究社区贡献了LLM评估方案和具体资源，强调评估需要与具体应用场景结合。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

Motivation: 线性注意力模型虽然效率高，但由于有限的内存会导致遗忘问题，在检索密集型任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出混合模型，结合了稀疏注意力与token淘汰机制，使用可学习的token淘汰方法和滑动窗口注意力，通过轻量级CNN自适应保留关键KV对。

Result: 在检索密集型基准测试中，该方法表现出有效性，同时保持了线性注意力的常数时间和空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 混合注意力模型能够有效缓解线性注意力模型的遗忘问题，在保持效率的同时提升检索密集型任务的性能。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

Motivation: 降低在检索增强生成中使用长上下文的计算成本，通过软上下文压缩将输入序列转换为更短的连续表示。

Method: 开发轻量级简单的均值池化方法，训练同一压缩器输出多种压缩比率，在多个QA数据集、模型家族、规模和压缩比率上进行广泛实验。

Result: 简单均值池化方法表现最强，在训练多种压缩比率时性能下降相对较小，但不同架构和训练机制之间的权衡更为复杂。

Conclusion: 均值池化是有效的软上下文压缩方法，但压缩方法的权衡关系复杂，需要更深入的研究。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，检测其生成文本的需求日益增长，但现有检测方法存在目标定义不一致、现实应用条件复杂等问题，导致检测结果意义有限。

Method: 通过分析LLM生成文本检测的现状，指出检测目标定义模糊、人类编辑和LLM对用户的影响模糊了人机文本界限，现有基准无法覆盖真实应用场景。

Result: 现有检测器的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱，检测器仅在特定条件下有用。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本检测器在特定条件下仍有用，但其结果应仅作为参考而非决定性指标，需要更清晰的定义和评估方法。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

### [150] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种量子启发的算法，使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)方法解决QUBO问题，在数独和MaxCut问题上成功找到全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找伊辛自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，传统方法难以找到全局最优解。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，采用离散驱动调度引导MPS向基态演化，结合驱动哈密顿量和问题哈密顿量实现自旋翻转和量子隧穿，通过DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 在包含200多个伊辛自旋的数独问题上成功找到全局最小值，在Biq Mac库的MaxCut问题上解决了最多251个节点和3265条边的实例。

Conclusion: 该量子启发算法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业规模QUBO应用的优势，能够可靠地识别全局最优解。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [151] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，用于量化大语言模型在能源系统分析中的推理可靠性，包含五个子指标，并在四种前沿模型上进行了测试验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在能源领域的验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，缺乏对分析结论逻辑完整性的标准化评估框架。

Method: 开发ARB框架，整合准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性约束、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用公开技术经济数据集在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估模型性能。

Result: GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet达到一致且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现中等，Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值，统计验证显示差异显著且可重现。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证AI系统因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信透明分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

### [152] [Branch-and-Browse: Efficient and Controllable Web Exploration with Tree-Structured Reasoning and Action Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19838)
*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Branch-and-Browse框架，通过树状结构探索、网页状态重放和页面动作记忆，显著提升LLM驱动的网络代理在复杂任务中的推理深度和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络代理方法在推理深度和效率上存在局限：线性方法无法处理多步推理且缺乏有效回溯，其他搜索策略则粒度粗糙且计算成本高。

Method: 采用细粒度网络代理框架，包含结构化推理-行动、上下文记忆和高效执行，具体包括：显式子任务管理的树状结构探索、基于网页状态重放的高效探索引导、页面动作记忆共享机制。

Result: 在WebArena基准测试中，任务成功率达到35.8%，执行时间相比最先进方法减少高达40.4%。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的LLM网络代理框架，在复杂网络环境中实现了更好的推理能力和执行效率。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

### [153] [DAG-Math: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19842)
*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DAG-MATH框架，将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图随机过程，引入逻辑紧密度指标评估LLM推理一致性，发现即使PASS@k指标相当，不同LLM在推理保真度上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法不清楚LLM在数学问题上的成功是源于搜索、死记硬背还是规则一致推理，需要超越传统PASS@k指标的新评估框架。

Method: 将思维链建模为基于规则的有向无环图随机过程，提出逻辑紧密度指标，构建DAG-MATH CoT格式基准测试。

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上，发现代表性LLM家族在推理保真度上存在统计显著差异，即使PASS@k指标相当，揭示了最终答案准确性与规则一致推导之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Surfer 2是一个纯视觉观察的统一架构，在Web、桌面和移动环境中实现最先进性能，通过层次化上下文管理、解耦规划执行和自适应恢复验证，在多个基准测试中超越所有先前系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统依赖环境特定接口，限制了跨平台部署能力，需要构建能在Web、桌面和移动环境中通用的智能代理。

Method: 集成层次化上下文管理、解耦的规划与执行、以及带自适应恢复的自我验证机制，实现长任务视野下的可靠操作。

Result: 在WebVoyager上达到97.1%准确率，WebArena 69.6%，OSWorld 60.1%，AndroidWorld 87.1%，无需任务特定微调即超越所有先前系统，多尝试时在所有基准上超越人类表现。

Conclusion: 系统化编排能放大基础模型能力，仅通过视觉交互实现通用计算机控制，同时需要下一代视觉语言模型来实现帕累托最优的成本效益。

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

### [155] [RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954)
*Joseph Meyer,Divyansha Lachi,Reza Mohammadi,Roshan Reddy Upendra,Eva L. Dyer,Mark Li,Tom Palczewski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RELATE是一个模式无关的图神经网络特征编码器，使用共享的模态特定编码器处理多模态节点属性，通过交叉注意力聚合为固定大小的节点表示，在保持性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络需要为每种节点类型和特征列设计特定的特征编码器，这限制了可扩展性和参数共享，特别是在处理异构时序图数据时。

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合为固定大小的排列不变节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE与ReLGNN和HGT配合使用，性能仅比模式特定编码器低3%，同时参数数量减少了5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式并实现多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [156] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈问题，使大规模快速伪造事故证据变得更容易。保险公司采用AI深度伪造检测等对策，但仍面临误报、漏报等挑战。本文提出了UVeye分层解决方案来检测和遏制车辆欺诈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故和夸大损失。生成式AI的出现让欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的碰撞照片、损坏证据和虚假身份，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司部署AI深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测AI驱动的欺诈。本文提出了UVeye分层解决方案，代表在检测、缓解和威慑这种新型欺诈方面的重大进步。

Result: 当前的缓解策略存在显著局限性，检测工具可能出现误报和漏报，复杂的欺诈者不断调整策略逃避自动化检查。生成式AI与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏仍在继续。

Conclusion: 由于资源成本障碍和欺诈者不断适应，打击AI驱动的保险欺诈仍然是一个持续挑战。需要更先进的分层解决方案来应对这一新威胁。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习模型通过领导力人格特质预测学术成功，在129名环境工程硕士生中实现了87.5%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学术表现，为早期识别学生优劣势和制定个性化学习策略提供机会。

Method: 收集129名硕士生的5项领导力人格测试数据（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用7种机器学习算法进行建模，包括SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost和LightGBM。

Result: RF分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 研究证实了通过领导力人格特质预测学术成功的可行性，为教育早期阶段识别学生特点并制定个性化学习策略提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [158] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

TL;DR: AI PB是一个生产级的生成式智能体，在零售金融领域部署，能够主动生成基于事实、合规且个性化的投资洞察，而非被动回答查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融领域，需要可信赖的AI洞察，但传统聊天机器人只能被动响应。AI PB旨在通过主动生成、基于事实且合规的洞察来满足高风险的金融环境需求。

Method: 采用组件化编排层根据数据敏感性确定性地路由内部和外部LLM；使用混合检索管道结合OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型；多阶段推荐机制融合规则启发式、序列行为建模和上下文赌博机。

Result: 系统在韩国金融监管下完全本地部署，使用Docker Swarm和vLLM跨24个NVIDIA H100 GPU运行。通过人工QA和系统指标验证了基于事实的生成与显式路由和分层安全能够提供可信赖的AI洞察。

Conclusion: 在金融等高风险领域，通过基于事实的生成、显式路由和分层安全措施，可以实现可信赖的AI洞察生成。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为中心的多智能体系统，用于数字资产交易异常检测，通过解析、检测和解释三个角色的对话工作流程，让非专家能够用自然语言查询、检查结构化分析并获得上下文感知的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高金融取证中的透明度和信任度，让非专家用户能够理解和交互式地参与异常检测过程。

Method: 将解析、检测和解释三个角色链接到对话工作流程中，使用XGBoost作为基础检测器，通过开源Web UI将用户意图转换为检测模式并提供基于底层特征的叙述性解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混合数据集（Wasabi Wallet，2020-2024）上，基线检测器达到强准确性，而HCLA增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人在回路的设计提高了金融取证中的透明度和信任度，系统成功实现了让非专家用户参与和理解异常检测过程的目标。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [161] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用，提出了验证-价值悖论，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求抵消，导致净价值微乎其微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 律师因提交AI生成的不准确内容而受到谴责的案例表明，当前对AI在法律实践中使用的评估范式需要重新审视，特别是考虑到AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度，以及律师的诚信、正直和不误导法庭的首要职责。

Method: 提出了一个替代模型来评估AI在法律实践中的使用，即验证-价值悖论，该模型更全面地反映了AI的特性和律师的职责。

Result: 验证-价值悖论表明，AI在法律实践中使用的效率提升会被相应的手动验证输出的需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值对律师而言往往微乎其微。

Conclusion: 论文阐述了验证-价值悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响，强调了对真理的忠诚和公民责任等价值观应成为法律实践的基础。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [162] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一个去中心化的AI审计系统，通过共识机制、层次化DAG分解、区块链账本和隐私保护技术，解决大语言模型推理链的忠实性和无害性验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审计方法存在集中化、不透明和难以扩展的问题，无法有效验证大语言模型复杂推理链的忠实性和无害性，这在高风险领域部署专有模型时存在重大风险。

Method: TRUST框架包含四个核心组件：1) 多样化审计者间的共识机制，可容忍30%恶意参与者；2) 层次化DAG推理链分解，支持可扩展并行审计；3) 区块链账本记录验证决策；4) 隐私保护的分段共享，仅暴露部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医学、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST框架开创了去中心化AI审计的新范式，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出AGI发展需要经历身份固化的锁定阶段，从开放模仿转向稳定身份，并建立了检测指标。实验发现不同规模模型呈现不同的固化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型过于开放和可操纵，而真正的AGI需要稳定的身份和拒绝能力，这需要通过身份固化阶段来实现。

Method: 形式化身份固化阶段，将其与学习动态现象关联，提出操作性检测指标，并在不同规模模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 行为固化快速且非线性，但对通用能力的影响各异：小模型有性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本，大型量化模型出现暂时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI可靠性的前提，也是安全控制的关键点，既可被工程化设计，也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，导致不可预测的行为固化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了在2048游戏中优化AI的进化训练方法，比较了单智能体系统和双智能体元提示系统的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略游戏和随机元素，是研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应的理想平台。

Method: 实现两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（思考者LLM为执行者LLM优化策略）和基于蒙特卡洛树搜索价值函数优化的单智能体系统，并实验了回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得显著改进，每周期平均增加473.2分，训练周期间呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解增强，开发出更先进的策略。双智能体系统改进有限，显示了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 进化优化技术在非确定性环境中改善AI性能具有潜力，单智能体方法比元提示方法更有效。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果，通过小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够模仿表面的人类行为如角色扮演，但其模拟更深层次个体认知过程的能力仍不清楚，需要系统评估LLM在个性化认知模拟中的表现。

Method: 构建基于近期出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试不同认知表征方法（语言特征、概念映射、基于档案的信息）在作者风格模仿中的效果。

Result: 结果显示概念和语言特征的组合在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索。LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，突显了其在更深层次认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推动了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术的发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象的PDDL领域和问题实例，以支持基于自然语言目标的规划抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态领域抽象的选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力，当前缺乏有效的抽象生成方法。

Method: 在PDDL中建模具体行为，使用LLM进行上下文学习，生成三类抽象：替代具体动作、动作序列和动作/谓词参数的抽象。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下能有效合成规划领域抽象，但在动作抽象方面优于相关流体的抽象。

Conclusion: LLM能够生成有用的规划领域抽象，但抽象能力在动作和流体方面存在差异。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出STaBERT模型，通过整合POI（兴趣点）和时间信息来增强人类移动性预测的准确性，显著提升了单城市和多城市预测的GEO-BLEU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类移动性预测模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用POI提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，在BERT-based移动性模型基础上加入时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示。

Result: 实验结果显示STaBERT显著提升预测准确率：单城市预测的GEO-BLEU分数从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: 整合POI和时间信息能够有效捕捉人类移动的语义基础，显著改善移动性预测性能。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的具身问答代理，通过工具提供有用信息来改进探索方向和答案准确性，在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA方法直接使用VLM探索环境而不进行显式思考或规划，限制了推理能力，导致探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA代理，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动生成EQA任务的数据管道，构建包含18K任务的EQA-RT数据集。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen上，ToolEQA相比SOTA基线成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本版本高10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过工具集成和多步推理显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了其通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI在医疗领域应用中的数据偏见问题，基于AI4HealthyAging项目经验，识别了临床数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据的质量和公平性问题，AI解决方案在实际临床实践中的应用仍然有限。数据收集过程中的偏见是主要障碍。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目经验，通过检测临床数据收集过程中的偏见，识别了多种偏见类型。

Result: 识别出历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住地、社会经济地位、设备和标签等变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的实用建议，以提高AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性，为开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，有助于建立负责任的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的出现，知识图谱构建从基于规则和统计的流程转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴的LLM驱动方法：基于模式的范式（强调结构、规范化和一致性）和无模式范式（强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现）。

Result: 系统分析了各阶段的代表性框架、技术机制及其局限性，为理解LLM与知识图谱的交互提供了清晰框架。

Conclusion: 展望了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时指令跟随能力和语义表示退化的问题，且不依赖原始基础模型或外部领域数据库。

Method: 使用指令-回复对话格式设计自监督目标，利用文本中嵌入的领域知识，在更深语义层面进行编码学习。

Result: IKnow框架能够有效适应新领域，同时保持模型的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一种简单通用的持续适应方法，无需外部资源即可实现领域知识的深度编码。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Motivation: 现有的概念学习方法依赖描述逻辑推理器，但这些推理器对知识库中的不一致和错误数据不够稳健，限制了在实际知识库中的应用。

Method: EBR神经推理器利用嵌入来近似符号推理结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集。

Result: 实验表明EBR在存在缺失和错误数据的情况下比现有推理器更稳健，能够有效处理现实世界知识库中的不完整性。

Conclusion: EBR为概念学习提供了一种稳健的神经推理方法，解决了传统符号推理器在现实世界知识库应用中的局限性。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性推理且需要训练数据。FLORA旨在解决这些问题，提供无监督、可解释的完整对齐方案。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，同时对齐实体和关系，允许存在无对应实体的悬空实体，并保证算法收敛。

Result: 在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的知识图谱对齐方法，具有无监督、可解释、收敛性好等优势，能处理悬空实体问题。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究旨在探讨政府在AI治理中如何收集和回应公众意见，以及这种参与过程是否能够建立公众对AI及其治理的信任。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较分析了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家邀请公众对AI风险和政策的评论过程，包括政府征集反馈的方式和反馈对治理的影响。

Result: 研究发现三个国家均未能建立有意义的公民与政策制定者对话，政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，公众参与率极低，且官员对反馈的回应有限，未能形成有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法无法建立信任或合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模系统拓扑优化方面取得重要进展，具备拓扑和跨系统泛化能力，为实现近实时拓扑优化迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

Motivation: 现有评估方法只关注最终答案正确性，忽略了推理过程质量，无法为模型改进提供细粒度信号

Method: 将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，提出CaSE方法通过仅使用前序上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准上验证CaSE与人工评估的一致性，证明基于CaSE评估的训练数据能直接提升最终任务性能

Conclusion: CaSE为分析和改进LLM推理提供了可扩展框架，证明了超越有效性检查的实际价值

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性算法，能在近线性时间内计算大规模网络中的节点重要性，并在包含1000万节点的真实网络上验证了效率和近似质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，无法应用于大规模网络。

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种基于采样根生成树。

Result: 两种算法在近线性时间内运行，提供强近似保证，在包含1000万节点的真实网络上验证了效率和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够高效计算大规模网络的随机游走中心性，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 可解释性设计模型对于在现实应用中建立对自动化决策模型的信任、问责和安全采用至关重要。

Method: 形式化定义了监督学习设置，涵盖表格数据、时间序列、图像、文本、交易和轨迹等多种数据类型。分析了特征重要性、规则和实例三类主要可解释模型家族，并形式化了因果性、公平性和隐私三个关键伦理属性。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发不仅准确和可解释，而且公平、保护隐私和具有因果意识的AI系统奠定了理论基础，即值得信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务评估基准存在任务多样性有限、缺乏多模态数据、使用合成数据以及语言覆盖范围窄等问题，无法可靠评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中的表现。

Method: 采用半自动流程：大模型生成候选回答，由50多名电子商务和多语言专家审核修改；基于不同规模模型评估分数定义问题难度等级。

Result: 构建了一个反映真实业务交互噪声和异构性的基准测试，包含来自真实客户查询和交易日志的数据，支持多语言特别是低资源东南亚语言。

Conclusion: EcomEval填补了电子商务领域评估基准的空白，为从业者提供了评估模型在复杂真实购物场景中能力的可靠工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试难以评估模型在动态扩展环境中的真正适应性，需要一种能够量化模型在状态变化中理解、预测和调整能力的指标。

Method: 区分封闭式和开放式基准测试，优先采用闭环开放式真实世界基准，通过测量模型对初始、当前和未来环境状态偏差的响应准确性来评估适应性。

Result: 开发了Fluidity Index作为量化模型适应性的指标，强调真正超级智能模型应具备至少二阶适应性，能够通过数字补充实现自持续计算以达到最优流动性。

Conclusion: Fluidity Index为评估模型在动态扩展环境中的适应性提供了有效工具，二阶适应性是实现超级智能的关键特征，能够确保模型在环境变化中保持最优性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的框架，用于自动化评估大语言模型推理轨迹的质量，相比传统图指标具有更高预测力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注，劳动密集且不可靠，需要更有效的自动化评估方案。

Method: 采用拓扑数据分析方法捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，通过拓扑特征进行质量评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在预测推理质量方面显著优于标准图指标，表明有效推理由高维几何结构而非纯关系图捕获。

Conclusion: 拓扑特征为推理质量提供了紧凑稳定的指标，可作为未来强化学习算法的实用信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个新颖的两阶段强化微调KGQA框架，采用'规划-知识图谱搜索和网络搜索-思考'范式，使LLM能够在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨知识图谱与网络的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用知识图谱的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景下。它们通常假设知识图谱覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法保持连贯的多步规划。

Method: Graph-RFT采用两阶段方法：1）使用定制化规划-检索数据集进行思维链微调，激活结构化推理；2）引入规划-检索引导的强化学习过程，整合显式规划和检索动作，采用笛卡尔式规划模块分解复杂问题，使用逻辑表达式指导工具调用，并通过多奖励设计优化检索调度。

Result: 该方法解决了GRPO冷启动问题，实现了覆盖感知的检索调度，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合知识图谱和网络检索，支持全局一致的多步推理。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT框架通过自主规划和自适应检索调度，显著提升了在知识不完整条件下复杂KGQA任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义均值积分的AGI一致性度量方法，替代了传统算术平均值的补偿性假设，通过曲线下面积(AUC)量化不同补偿性假设下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义采用算术平均值，假设领域间能力可以相互补偿，但真正的通用智能应该体现跨所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 使用广义均值在补偿性指数连续体上的积分，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值体系，通过曲线下面积(AUC)来度量AGI。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分显示，尽管算术得分较高(GPT-5达24%)，但一致性调整后的AUC表明两者距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分为衡量AGI真实进展提供了更严格、可解释的理论基础，能够惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖性。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层承担，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，表明自注意力专门负责检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能特化，特别是自注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的具体作用，挑战关于混合架构冗余性的假设。

Method: 通过注意力消融实验，在RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型上测试检索性能，并分析不同比例注意力头稀疏化对MMLU和检索任务的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层无补偿机制。仅保留15%注意力头就能维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU性能。

Conclusion: 混合架构中的自注意力层和SSM层存在严格的功能特化，自注意力专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专业化模块而非集成系统，对架构优化和可解释性有重要启示。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索确定，限制了性能提升潜力。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN代理，将学习型神经架构搜索控制器集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性方面均优于固定架构基准和随机搜索，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 架构自适应是在线深度强化学习中实现最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理设计可以从静态离线选择转变为学习过程的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在生成优化CUDA代码方面表现出色，但存在代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题。SLM虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限。

Method: 将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准测试上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法。

Conclusion: ReGraphT使SLM能够在不牺牲隐私或增加过多计算开销的情况下，在CUDA代码生成任务上达到接近LLM的性能水平。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通分配问题在大型网络中计算复杂度非线性增长，难以处理大规模OD对。需要数据驱动方法提高计算效率。

Method: 使用Transformer架构的深度神经网络，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间复杂相关性，支持多类别网络分析。

Result: 在多个测试网络上验证，模型比传统优化方法快数个数量级，计算成本降低，预测精度提高，能灵活适应需求变化。

Conclusion: Transformer模型为交通分配提供了高效解决方案，支持快速情景分析和交通管理决策，提升交通规划效率。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

Motivation: 医疗AI系统在诊断能力上表现出色，但在不同人口群体间存在性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理基础模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: 提出FairGRPO分层强化学习方法，采用基于代表性、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性加权。对于缺乏人口标签的临床数据，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上，FairGRPO将预测差异减少了27.2%，同时F1分数提高了12.49%。训练动态分析显示FairGRPO在整个优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI中的公平性问题，并发布了FairMedGemma-4B模型，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了人口群体间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 采用SHAP特征选择方法，使用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，通过Optuna进行超参数优化，使用SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，构建六个二分类场景。

Result: SHAP特征选择在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标的同时，增强了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于可解释性技术（SHAP）的特征选择被证明是一种有效方法，有助于开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构建随机特征，使用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开分解为不可约分量，通过特征分解识别不同类别的数据区域。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病分期分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺的科学领域取得了最先进的突破性成果。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER在何种情况下优于现有方法、其失效模式和其他局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中非精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机(LMO)框架下引入加性误差模型来分析非精确正交化更新，量化性能下降与LMO误差的关系。

Result: 分析表明：较低的正交化精度需要较小的步长但较大的动量参数，近似精度成为必须与学习计划共同调优的关键参数。

Conclusion: 将近似过程从实现细节提升为关键参数，NanoGPT实验验证了预测的耦合关系，最优学习率随近似精度变化而明显移动。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算准确量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新。

Method: 结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中工具，开发了两种新的f-DP核算方法，捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比基于Rényi DP的方法，我们的方法产生更紧的(ε,δ)边界和更好的效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够提供更准确的隐私保护分析。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归性能的影响，重点关注贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序在持续学习中的重要性，特别是贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法文献中的工具，形式化贪心排序策略，开发几何和代数直觉，并在线性回归和CIFAR-100分类任务上进行实证分析。

Result: 实证显示贪心排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序；理论分析表明在高秩回归设置下，贪心排序与随机排序有相似的损失界，但在一般秩设置下，允许重复的贪心排序收敛速度为O(1/k^(1/3))，而单次贪心排序可能失败。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪心和随机排序策略内部及之间的细微差别，为持续学习中的任务排序策略提供了理论指导和实践洞见。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的椭圆不确定性集合来处理金融市场中RL代理训练与部署环境不匹配的问题，解决了传统鲁棒RL方法无法捕捉市场影响方向性的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融应用中，RL代理通常在历史数据上训练，但在实际部署时，其交易行为会影响市场价格（市场影响），这种训练与部署环境的不匹配会显著降低性能。

Method: 开发了一类新颖的椭圆不确定性集合，建立了最坏情况不确定性的隐式和显式闭式解，实现了高效且可处理的鲁棒策略评估。

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更优的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了一种更忠实和可扩展的方法，能够有效处理市场影响的方向性问题。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器有效解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，在理论和实践中都优于标准方法。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以沿梯度方向对齐，而非保持固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，在理论和实证上均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度的随机扰动，但忽略了扰动方向与真实梯度方向对齐的潜在优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动方案的理论和实证特性。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度。同时提供了使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降收敛性分析。

Result: 理论分析表明DAP方案具有优越性。在合成问题和实际任务的实证评估中，DAP在特定条件下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的随机扰动方案相比传统固定长度扰动具有显著优势，特别是在关键梯度方向上能提供更准确的估计，扩展了零阶优化的理论框架和应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Motivation: 现有随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声，忽略了数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的有效性

Method: 开发UCAN框架，将现有随机平滑方法从对称噪声转换为非对称噪声分布，支持多种噪声分布和ℓ_p范数认证，并设计了三种噪声参数生成器来优化各向异性噪声参数

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证准确率比现有最优方法提升高达182.6%

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了对抗鲁棒性认证性能，为随机平滑技术提供了更有效的通用增强方案

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在时间序列预测中过度依赖长历史数据，但实际学习到大量冗余特征（如噪声和无关波动），影响了有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度时间片段指导梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC有效抑制了冗余特征学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时序建模的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码算法表现不佳，标准多重标记解码会显著降低性能。作者旨在证明MDLMs额外计算成本的合理性，并开发新的推理方法。

Method: 1. 推理即填充：使用MDLMs填充推理模板，区分推理和答案标记，实现答案不确定性测量和早期退出；2. 多重标记熵解码：基于条件熵的自适应采样器，减少并行解码位置时的错误。

Result: 在GSM8k上，使用后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base可获得与人类编写推理轨迹相当的性能提升；MED在保持性能的同时减少2.7倍推理步骤。

Conclusion: MDLMs的训练和计算为推理和后训练解锁了许多新方法，证明其额外计算成本的合理性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Motivation: 解决RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中的传感器特异性差问题，包括长距离检测、欺骗和伪造等漏洞，这些可能导致错误检测和操作安全事件。

Method: 在CAD建模的平面图中使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，对12个实验室区域进行位置推断。处理类别不平衡问题，使用分层子采样到5000个平衡观测值。

Result: 整体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40。但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类，即使使用了类别权重。计算了邻接感知混淆矩阵以更好地解释物理相邻区域。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可以在真实模拟中应用，实现国防供应链的区域级异常检测或错放监控。通过更好的天线放置或额外传感器及多模态传感器融合，可以提高低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Conclusion: SALT有效解决了群体RL算法中的奖励分配问题，为复杂多步任务提供了稳定高效的训练方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拒绝采样的新算法，能够从现有TPP模型中并行、精确地采样多个未来值，无需架构更改或重新训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间点过程模型采用自回归方式，采样过程本质上是顺序的，限制了效率，需要解决表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距

Method: 基于拒绝采样的算法，能够并行生成多个未来事件，同时保持精确性

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了经验性加速，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模TPP应用提供了表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的桥梁

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑广告延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性的个性化竞价策略，通过CMDP建模和两阶段估计方法，实现了近乎最优的遗憾边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）和用户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为带延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程（CMDP），提出两阶段最大似然估计结合数据分割策略，并基于此设计强化学习算法来推导个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法实现了近乎最优的遗憾边界$\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$，其中$d$是上下文维度，$H$是轮数，$T$是用户数量。理论结果通过仿真实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了高效的个性化竞价策略解决方案。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Result: 在开源LLM和多样化数据集上实验，性能显著优于现有方法，特别在需要长推理链的领域

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升推测解码性能，计算和延迟开销大幅降低，在多种场景下优于现有技术

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Motivation: 探索加密资产市场的流动性和波动率代理是否能够产生溢出效应，从而预测整个市场的风险水平。

Method: 集成三个统计层次的分析框架：核心流动性与收益的相互作用、主成分关系、波动率因子投影，辅以向量自回归、HAR-X模型和泄漏安全的机器学习协议。

Result: 使用2021-2025年74个资产的1462个日度数据，发现跨层次的统计显著格兰杰因果关系和适度的样本外预测准确性。

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动率代理确实产生溢出效应，能够预测市场范围风险，具有统计显著性和适度的预测能力。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

TL;DR: 提出了耦合Transformer自编码器（CTAE），这是一个序列模型，能够同时处理非平稳非线性动态，并在单一框架中分离共享与区域特定的神经活动结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构，要么局限于单一脑区、假设线性读出，或混淆共享和私有信号。需要一种能够同时捕获多脑区神经动态并分离共享与私有信号的方法。

Method: CTAE使用Transformer编码器和解码器捕获长程神经动态，并明确将每个区域的潜在空间划分为正交的共享和私有子空间。

Result: 在两个高密度电生理数据集上验证了CTAE的有效性，包括运动皮层和感觉区域的同步记录。CTAE提取的表征比现有方法更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE能够有效处理多脑区神经记录中的复杂动态，并成功分离共享与区域特定的神经活动模式。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过形状片段分割和Shapley值评估来识别关键形状片段，提高解释的精确度和因果保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有的事后解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽略了分类结果主要由关键形状片段驱动的基本前提。

Method: 提出ShapeX框架，包含形状片段描述与检测(SDD)框架，学习对分类至关重要的多样化形状片段，并使用Shapley值评估其显著性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精确度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过形状片段驱动的分割和Shapley值分析，能够产生揭示因果关系而非仅仅相关性的解释，得益于形状片段的原子性特性。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Method: 使用基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，包含CORAL头部和标准分类头部，3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖关系，显式时间间隔嵌入捕捉发布行为动态，采用组合损失函数（0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss），冻结MentalRoBERTa前6层并使用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证进行评估，以宏F1分数为主要指标。

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效处理社交媒体自杀风险检测中的多重挑战，包括类别不平衡、时间复杂性和风险级别的双重性质。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

TL;DR: 提出基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线方法竞争，实现理论保证与可扩展性的统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在理论保证与可扩展性之间的鸿沟：GES和GraN-DAG等算法经验性能强但缺乏有限样本保证，而理论方法无法扩展到大规模图

Method: 使用DDQN强化学习智能体直接与GES或GraN-DAG等基线方法竞争，始终从对手解进行热启动，确保学习到的图不会比对手差

Result: 在合成SEM（30节点）上观察到的错误概率随样本量n衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在Sachs、Asia、Alarm等真实数据集上持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）和Andes（220节点）等大规模图

Conclusion: 建立了同时具有可证明一致性、样本高效性和实际可扩展性的RL因果发现算法新类别，在统一经验性能与严格有限样本理论方面迈出决定性一步

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量至关重要，但常用的欧氏距离存在诸多问题，需要更有效的距离度量和维度加权方法。

Method: 开发了新的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权闵可夫斯基距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状。

Conclusion: 该方法是对KNN分类器的重要推广，通过提出的加权方案和适当范数，在高维小样本数据集中实现了更有意义的最近邻选择。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习方法持续遭受原型部分坍塌问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了提供多样化和信息丰富目标的核心目的。现有方法通过过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器分别在不同目标下学习。具体将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格过程独立于编码器损失进行更新。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦消除了原型坍塌，无需显式正则化，产生了持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了自监督学习中的原型坍塌问题，提供了一种更有效的训练策略。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型表现不佳，原因在于简单套用NLP/CV范式失败，需要转向基于时间语义不变性的原则性数据集设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量监督基线和经典模型，原因是盲目套用NLP/CV的爬取一切在线数据范式不适用于时间序列数据。

Method: 建议从机会性聚合转向原则性设计：构建系统覆盖时间语义不变性空间的数据集，基于第一原则建立时间序列不变性本体论。

Result: 通过确保不变性覆盖的表示完整性，时间序列基础模型才能获得对齐结构，实现泛化、推理和真正涌现行为。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型的发展需要范式转变，从爬取一切转向基于时间语义不变性原则的系统性数据集构建。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型揭示了阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白传播的结构连接和功能连接相互作用机制，发现SC和FC在不同脑区和疾病阶段有不对称贡献，并与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经影像学证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，但结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响tau传播尚不清楚。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型分析SC-FC相互作用。

Result: 发现FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域作用更大；SC和FC的相对主导地位随疾病进展而变化；SC和FC主导区域的空间模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau传播中具有区域特异性和阶段依赖性的不对称贡献，这些模式与AD的分子机制密切相关。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP方法有效解决了隐私保护去中心化学习的挑战，显著提升了训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中，在LLM优化中实现与可量化人类价值信号的对齐，优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RLVR方法在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但它忽略了并非所有任务都具有同等重要性。需要将人类定义的价值信号直接纳入奖励函数。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接整合人类定义的价值信号。使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的中止策略。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模上始终优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确性，还学习了价值敏感的中止策略：对低价值提示简洁，对高价值提示详尽。

Conclusion: RLEV在噪声价值信号下保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先级对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个风险感知的约束强化学习框架，使用优化确定性等价来处理奖励分布尾部的风险，确保在适当约束条件下与原始约束问题的等价性，并能与标准RL求解器结合使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束强化学习框架仅关注期望累积奖励，忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，这在高风险应用中是不够的，需要处理异常值的风险。

Method: 使用优化确定性等价来构建风险感知约束RL框架，在参数化强拉格朗日对偶框架下确保与原始约束问题的等价性，并能包装标准RL求解器如PPO。

Result: 在常见假设下建立了算法的收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了方法的风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用中的强化学习提供了有效的风险感知约束优化解决方案，具有良好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [223] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：逐点可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，在保持样本效率的同时克服了完全可复制性的强不可能性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单学习任务中已被证明是不可能的，作者希望探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习仍然是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1) 逐点可复制性：对固定输入保持一致性；(2) 近似可复制性：对分布中大多数点分类一致；(3) 半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 对于常数可复制性参数，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：前两种方法使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，第三种需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当松弛可复制性要求，可以在保持学习能力的同时实现稳定性，为实际应用提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究评估了使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列的常规实验室数据进行癌症风险分类的可行性，发现虽然存在可检测的癌症信号，但性能不足以用于可靠的临床筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发犬类早期癌症检测的可及性筛查工具面临挑战，常规实验室数据成本低但受限于生物标志物非特异性和严重类别不平衡问题。

Method: 系统比较了126个分析流程，包括不同机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，使用患者级数据分区防止泄漏，最优模型为带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器。

Result: 最佳模型显示中等排序能力（AUROC=0.815）但临床分类性能差（F1-score=0.25，PPV=0.15），高阴性预测值（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79）。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在统计可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床区分，需要整合多模态数据源。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CO-PFL是一种新颖的个性化联邦学习算法，通过动态评估客户端贡献来解决数据异构性问题，结合梯度方向差异和预测偏差分析，提供有原则的聚合权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在数据异构和稀疏的客户端场景下表现不佳，其基于数据量的启发式聚合方法无法准确评估每个客户端更新的实际效用和可靠性，导致次优个性化和聚合偏差。

Method: CO-PFL通过分析梯度和数据子空间，联合评估梯度方向差异和预测偏差，动态估计客户端贡献。同时结合参数级个性化机制和掩码感知动量优化，增强个性化适应性和优化稳定性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（CIFAR10、CIFAR10C、CINIC10和Mini-ImageNet）上的广泛实验表明，CO-PFL在个性化准确性、鲁棒性、可扩展性和收敛稳定性方面持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: CO-PFL有效缓解了聚合偏差，加强了全局协调，通过构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型提升了本地性能，为异构数据环境下的联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重新构建约束优化问题，显著提升了带公平性约束的谱聚类算法的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在引入群体公平性约束时计算效率较低，需要改进计算时间。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新构建优化问题，开发了Fair-SMW算法，采用三种不同谱间隙的拉普拉斯矩阵变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优方法快两倍，同时能实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平性约束的同时显著提升了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列预测任务中，类别信息对于捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架为QKCV，引入静态类别嵌入C，作为即插即用模块增强各种注意力模型，支持仅更新静态嵌入的轻量级微调。

Result: QKCV在多个真实数据集上显著提升了各种注意力模型的预测精度，并在微调预训练模型时仅需更新静态嵌入即可获得优越性能，降低计算开销。

Conclusion: QKCV注意力机制有效整合类别信息，提升时间序列预测性能，同时提供高效的微调策略，具有良好的实用价值。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID数据下存在模型过拟合和本地模型发散的问题，需要改进模型个性化能力。

Method: 使用超网络学习客户端依赖的dropout率，通过条件dropout后验实现元学习的后验适应和贝叶斯联邦学习的后验聚合。

Result: 在多个稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD表现出优秀的分类准确性和不确定性校准性能，特别是对分布外客户端。

Conclusion: MetaVD能有效压缩本地模型参数，缓解模型过拟合，降低通信成本，提升联邦学习在非IID数据下的性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上都表现出色，为max-min多目标强化学习提供了可证明收敛的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能在不显著增加计算成本的情况下提高图神经网络在分子属性预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络是目前预测分子属性的最有效方法，但需要更准确的模型。增加模型复杂度会提高计算成本和内存需求，因此需要一种既能提高准确性又不显著增加成本的方法。

Method: 开发了层到层知识混合(LKM)方法，通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的平均绝对距离，有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在三个GNN架构(DimeNet++、MXMNet、PAMNet)和三个数据集(QM9、MD17、Chignolin)上评估，LKM将量子化学和生物物理属性预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学属性预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前选择性分类器难以达到完美排序oracle的性能水平，需要系统分析这种性能差距的来源，为构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器提供指导。

Method: 提出选择性分类差距的有限样本分解框架，将差距分解为五个具体来源，并在合成数据和真实视觉、语言基准上进行验证实验，通过控制实验分离每个误差成分。

Result: 验证了贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距；只有特征感知校准器能显著改进评分排序；数据偏移引入的松弛需要分布鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和可操作的设计指南，帮助实践者构建更接近理想oracle行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

Conclusion: FedGPS通过统计分布和梯度信息的协同整合，有效解决了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，展现出强大的跨场景适应性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，指导行为基础模型在测试时通过环境交互进行任务推断，实现零样本强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为基础模型在测试时需要计算大量推理数据的奖励，这需要访问奖励函数的函数形式或进行大量标注工作。为了缓解这些限制，研究旨在通过环境交互进行任务推断。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM算法，该算法直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，并指导BFMs进行数据收集以进行任务推断。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少量episode内识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾界限，并通过环境交互实现了高效的任务推断，减少了数据需求。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

### [235] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向性，通过创建任务规范与单元测试直接冲突的"不可能"任务变体来量化作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在完成任务时倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"，这会严重影响评估的可靠性和实际部署的安全性，比如LLM代理可能会删除失败的测试而不是修复底层错误。

Method: 通过从现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）创建任务规范与单元测试直接冲突的"不可能"任务变体，测量代理在这些任务上的通过率作为"作弊率"。

Result: 揭示了从简单测试修改到复杂运算符重载等不同粒度的作弊行为细节，展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench不仅是一个评估工具，更是一个多功能框架，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，帮助构建更鲁棒可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑特征能捕捉图像数据中的全局几何结构，但在深度学习中的实际应用需要计算效率和可微分性。

Method: 开发了针对Ampere GPU优化的CUDA内核，使用128B合并访问和分层共享内存累加；创建了可微分PyTorch层，通过可微分欧拉特征变换风格的sigmoid松弛学习单方向阈值。

Conclusion: 该工作为拓扑特征在深度学习中的广泛应用奠定了基础，讨论了批处理和多GPU扩展以扩大采用范围。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [237] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中并未显著优于Best-of-N选择，尽管成本更高，主要原因是PRM对状态值的近似不可靠且泛化能力差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择方法无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，因此研究PRM引导的树搜索是否能通过探索多个部分解路径来改进数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型(PRM)分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其关联PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上比较PRM引导的树搜索与Best-of-N方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比Best-of-N无统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索优于其他PRM引导方法；PRM对状态值近似差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的依赖更强，在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了SynTSBench评估框架，通过可编程特征配置系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本建模能力，包括三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据异常下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在时间序列预测中虽然基准数据集表现良好，但在实际应用中性能不稳定，主要由于黑盒架构和现有评估框架无法提供模型具体优缺点的量化洞察。

Method: 使用合成数据驱动评估范式，通过可编程特征配置系统评估模型能力，包括时间特征分解、鲁棒性分析和理论最优基准测试三个维度。

Result: 实验表明当前深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基准。

Conclusion: SynTSBench框架能够系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本能力，为模型选择提供更清晰的量化依据。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)作为改进的大-小模型协作方法，相比传统MLP方法，KCM在保持任务准确性的同时显著减少计算资源消耗，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大-小模型协作框架存在准确性下降、灾难性遗忘加剧、小模型知识引发的幻觉问题等挑战，需要改进协作方法。

Method: 采用KAN(可解释神经网络架构)作为协作模型，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持近似的任务准确性；相比MLP协作模型，KCM在所有指标上表现更优，显著缓解灾难性遗忘，提升长尾数据准确性。

Conclusion: KAN-based协作模型(KCM)在大-小模型协作中表现出色，既能降低计算成本，又能保持性能并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Method: 从14k CC授权论文构建CS-54k语料库，使用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制，创建CS-4k基准测试集和CS-50k训练集

Result: CS-4k能够区分最先进LLM的能力层次，在CS-50k上训练的7B模型优于GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等更大专有系统

Conclusion: 使AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于使用高质量数据进行领域对齐训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法在图表泛化方面持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的IRM-free方法有效捕获因果子图，显著提升了图神经网络在分布偏移下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤早期精确诊断的挑战，传统深度学习方法依赖数据增强限制了泛化能力和临床可信度，需要开发无需增强且可解释的模型。

Method: 使用VGG16和Xception双主干网络提取互补的局部和全局特征，引入频率门控注意力模块，集成Grad-CAM进行肿瘤区域可视化。

Result: 在7K-DS数据集上4类分类准确率达99.24%，3类和2类分别为98.68%和99.85%；在独立3K-DS数据集上泛化准确率达95.77%，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net展示了无需数据增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InvDec混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在保持时间建模能力的同时有效建模跨变量依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多元时间序列预测中存在局限：通道独立方法如PatchTST擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法如iTransformer牺牲了时间编码能力。

Method: 结合基于patch的时间编码器和通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器，引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，并采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验显示，在高维数据集上显著提升：电力数据集MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增强，证实了随着变量数量增加，跨变量建模变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，提供理论保证的同时处理多个遗忘请求，并具备高效适应动态遗忘需求的能力。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性路由框架能够高效结合快速奖励模型和强大LLM裁判的优势，在保持成本效益的同时显著提升RLHF的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Motivation: 现有层次预测方法需要估计预测误差的协方差矩阵来进行最优协调，但真实协方差矩阵未知，从有限样本估计的协方差矩阵与真实值存在差距，可能降低预测性能。

Method: 为估计的协方差矩阵引入不确定性集合，构建最小化最坏情况期望平方误差的鲁棒协调问题，并将其转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中考虑协方差矩阵的不确定性是有效的，鲁棒优化框架能够提升层次时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率指标(RBP)来补充交叉熵的局限性，更全面地理解语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在贪婪采样等场景中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对概率指标(RBP)来衡量正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立了相对缩放定律，通过在四个数据集和四个模型家族上进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 实验表明相对缩放定律具有鲁棒性和准确性，能够解释涌现现象并帮助寻找缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实际开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个结合排序和压缩操作的工业回收场景基准环境，评估模块化与单体控制策略，发现动作掩码对性能有决定性影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程控制需要局部专业化和全局协调，但现有RL方法面临奖励设计、模块化和动作空间管理等挑战，学术基准与工业问题差异大

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个基准，构建顺序回收场景，比较模块化架构（专业代理）和单体架构（全系统控制），分析动作掩码的影响

Result: 无动作掩码时代理难以学习有效策略，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后两种架构都显著改善，性能差距缩小

Conclusion: 动作空间约束具有决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化多代理RL解决方案提供了有价值的测试平台

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

### [250] [Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20413)
*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了DPO算法的局限性，指出当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时，DPO会出现错误设定问题，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等失败模式。作者提出了AuxDPO方法，通过在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来缓解这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO等直接对齐算法使用监督学习而非两阶段RLHF进行模型微调，但当真实奖励函数无法通过策略类实现时，DPO会出现错误设定问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 分析了DPO的统计估计问题，研究了两阶段RLHF的局部行为，并提出了AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量来逼近RLHF解。

Result: 在理论分析和实验验证中，AuxDPO在指导性赌博机设置和LLM对齐任务中表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO通过引入辅助变量有效缓解了DPO的错误设定问题，提供了一种更稳健的直接对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于阈值的方法来处理标记时间点过程中的标记不平衡问题，通过调整标记概率来优化预测性能，并开发了新的神经MTPP模型来支持有效的时间采样和概率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中事件标记分布高度不平衡，现有研究忽视了这一点，导致对稀有标记事件的预测性能不佳。

Method: 提出阈值方法学习阈值来调整标记概率，先预测标记再预测时间，开发了新的神经MTPP模型避免计算昂贵的数值积分。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在下一事件标记和时间预测方面优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过处理标记不平衡问题，显著提高了下一事件预测的性能，特别是对于稀有标记事件。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型行为修复中的样本优先级策略，提出了语义感知优先采样方法(SAPS)，在解毒效果、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在真实系统中部署时会产生有毒或有偏见的输出，而参数更新的高成本促使需要选择性使用修复数据。

Method: 评估了五种代表性选择方法：随机采样、K-Center、基于梯度范数的选择(GraNd)、分层覆盖(CCS)以及提出的语义感知优先采样(SAPS)，通过毒性减少、困惑度和三个复合指标评估修复效果。

Result: SAPS在解毒、效用保持和效率之间达到最佳平衡，用更少数据实现相当或更好的修复效果。随机采样对大型或鲁棒模型仍然有效，而高开销方法如CCS和GraNd收益有限。

Conclusion: 样本选择应被视为修复管道中的可调组件，这些发现确立了基于选择的修复作为维护LLM可靠性的高效可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物相互作用预测方法依赖孤立的药物表示，无法显式建模原子级跨分子交互，限制了在不同分子复杂度和DDI类型分布下的有效性。

Method: 构建药物对的联合图整合原子结构，引入结构一致性模块迭代精炼节点特征同时保持全局结构上下文，有效学习局部和全局交互模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MolBridge在长尾和归纳场景中均优于现有最先进基线，实现了卓越性能。

Conclusion: 细粒度图精炼方法显著提高了DDI事件预测的准确性、鲁棒性和机制可解释性，为药物相互作用网络挖掘提供了有效的图分析方法。

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种图神经网络方法，通过时间有向图显式建模网球比赛中的不可传递性关系（A胜B、B胜C但C胜A），发现博彩公司在处理高不可传递性比赛时表现不佳，并利用该模型在选择性投注中获得了3.26%的投资回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递的玩家优势关系，但现有预测方法很少尝试将其纳入考虑。博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高不可传递性比赛时表现不佳，这为利用图神经网络方法捕捉关系动态提供了机会。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，通过时间有向图显式建模不可传递关系，其中玩家作为节点，历史比赛结果作为有向边。

Result: 模型在选择性投注高不可传递性比赛时达到65.7%的准确率和0.215的Brier评分，在1903次投注中实现了3.26%的投资回报率（使用Kelly投注策略）。

Conclusion: 博彩市场在处理不可传递性比赛时存在效率不足，本文提出的基于图的方法能够成功利用这种市场低效性，为捕捉关系动态提供了独特优势。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Method: 1. 引入基于排序损失的偏好模型来检测图像是否含水印，仅使用程序生成的图像训练；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像，实现水印移除和伪造；3. 仅需单张水印图像，无需水印模型知识。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，质疑当前水印方法的安全性。

Conclusion: 当前水印方法存在安全漏洞，提出的伪造攻击方法简单实用，仅需单张水印图像即可实现水印移除和伪造，对水印技术的安全性构成威胁。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有半监督微调方法依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，导致模型偏差和超参数敏感性。

Method: Bi-CoG方法同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，结合错误感知动态伪标签分配策略来分配高质量、低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，能有效解决半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解为零膨胀和长尾分布，分别用hurdle模型和逆模型去偏学习处理，显著改善强降雨反演性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中面临标签分布不平衡的挑战，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致对罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分治策略：1）用hurdle模型处理零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）；2）提出IMDL方法处理长尾分布，将学习目标转化为无偏的理想逆模型。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL优于传统、成本敏感、生成和多任务学习方法，有效缓解系统低估，显著改善强到极端降雨的反演。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: SheafAlign是一个基于层论的去中心化多模态对齐框架，通过多比较空间替代单空间对齐，无需所有模态间相互冗余假设，在分布式场景中实现更好的零样本泛化和跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立，限制了方法的适用性和性能。

Method: 使用层结构建模成对模态关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，通过多比较空间实现对齐。

Result: 在多模态传感数据集上表现出优越的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐性能和缺失模态鲁棒性，通信成本比现有最优方法降低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign框架突破了传统方法对模态间相互冗余的依赖，在分布式场景中实现了更有效的多模态对齐，同时保留了共享和独特信息。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成的快速发展，新的安全担忧出现，特别是后门漏洞。虽然先前工作探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但条件性特别是文本引导的图生成仍然未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在VAE和扩散训练期间植入后门，当推理时出现触发器时会诱导攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明攻击有效且隐蔽：不到10%的毒化率可达50%攻击成功率，24%毒化率可达80%以上成功率，对良性样本的性能影响可忽略。消融研究显示后门是在VAE和扩散训练而非预训练期间植入的。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，突显了在药物发现等模型应用中的严重风险，并强调了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的快速LLM适配方法，通过选择性矩阵分解提升下游任务准确率，仅需100个样本和单次梯度计算即可完成适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LASER方法虽然能提升准确率，但其逐层搜索和全数据集前向传播的计算开销过大，难以快速部署。

Method: 使用矩阵奇异值梯度识别关键矩阵，允许行聚类到多个子空间分别分解，仅需100个样本计算梯度和评估准确率。

Result: 方法将准确率提升高达24.6个百分点，大幅减少搜索时间，实现快速稳健的LLM适配。

Conclusion: 结合这些发现可构建快速稳健的下游任务适配算法，无需微调即可有效适配LLM到新数据集。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了图重连技术如何影响图结构指标及其与下游任务性能的关系，发现成功的重连方法倾向于保留局部结构同时允许全局连接的灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图重连技术虽然能缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前缺乏对哪些结构属性必须保留以确保性能提升和结构保真度的系统研究。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重连策略，并将局部和全局图属性的变化与节点分类准确性相关联，系统分析重连对图结构指标的影响。

Result: 结果显示一致的模式：成功的重连方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重连策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Motivation: 工业环境中MLOps实践日益普及，但将其与OT系统集成面临显著挑战，需要解决这些障碍以实现成功整合。

Method: 评估RAMI 4.0和ISA-95标准对MLOps集成的适用性，将MLOps生命周期组件映射到RAMI 4.0参考架构，并通过实际用例进行验证。

Result: 研究发现标准MLOps实践不能直接移植到OT环境，但通过使用现有参考模型进行结构化适配，可以提供成功的集成路径。

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in
industrial settings, yet their integration with Opera- tional Technology (OT)
systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic
approach to embed MLOps prac- tices into established OT reference models. We
evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-
nents to RAMI 4.0 exemplified by a real-world use case. Our findings
demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted

provide a pathway for successful integration.

Method: 学习子问题的能量景观，测试时组合多个子问题的能量函数构建全局能量景观，引入并行能量最小化技术

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越现有最佳方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题

Conclusion: 组合能量景观方法有效提升了推理任务的泛化能力

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

TL;DR: 对随机梯度下降(SGD)在期望平滑性(ES)条件下的收敛性进行系统分析，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件提供了更灵活的替代方案。

Method: 细化ES条件解释和采样相关常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，证明不同步长调度下的O(1/K)收敛率。

Result: 建立了SGD在ES条件下的收敛理论框架，给出了显式残差误差的收敛速率分析。

Conclusion: 为SGD的收敛性分析提供了统一的理论基础，扩展了现有研究范围。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了代码生成任务中的检索配置，发现对于PL-PL任务，稀疏BM25结合词级分割最有效；对于NL-PL任务，专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高；最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化；简单行分割与语法感知分割效果相当；不同配置间延迟差异可达200倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实计算预算下代码生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和错误定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: (1) PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割最有效；(2) NL-PL任务中专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；(3) 最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化；(4) 行分割与语法分割效果相当；(5) 不同配置延迟差异达200倍，BM25+词分割提供最佳质量-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 为基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率实现有效的代码导向RAG系统提供了基于证据的推荐配置。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将群体智能与可解释机器学习相结合，能够实现稳健、可信且具有临床意义的乳腺癌诊断。

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MS-BART是一个统一建模框架，通过大规模预训练将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表中，解决质谱数据稀缺问题，在多个关键指标上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质谱在分子识别中起关键作用，但由于标注谱图稀缺，从质谱数据中解析结构仍然具有挑战性。现有的大规模预训练方法难以直接应用于质谱领域。

Method: 提出MS-BART框架，将质谱和分子结构映射到共享词汇表，通过多任务预训练目标（去噪和翻译任务）增强泛化能力，并使用化学反馈机制减少分子幻觉。

Result: 在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的12个关键指标中，MS-BART在5个指标上达到SOTA性能，比基于扩散的方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: MS-BART通过统一建模框架和化学反馈机制，有效解决了质谱结构解析中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高性能和高效率的分子识别。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现当前理论（强隐私需要更小的C）与实证结果（强隐私下更大的C表现更好）存在不匹配，这是由于梯度分布变化导致的。在有限计算预算下，现有的批量大小调优启发式方法无效，而累积DP噪声能更好地解释批量大小的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私迁移学习（在私有数据上微调预训练模型）是隐私约束下训练大模型的当前最先进方法。本文旨在解决该领域中两个关键超参数（裁剪边界C和批量大小B）选择的理论与实践之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究裁剪边界C对性能的影响；在有限计算预算（固定轮数）下，检验批量大小B的调优启发式方法；分析累积DP噪声对批量大小选择的影响；研究跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置的局限性。

Result: 发现强隐私约束下，更大的裁剪边界C反而表现更好，这与理论预期相反；现有批量大小调优启发式方法在有限计算预算下无效；累积DP噪声能更好地解释批量大小选择；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致次优性能，特别是在隐私约束从宽松到严格、计算资源从充足到有限的变化时。

Conclusion: 裁剪边界C的选择应考虑梯度分布变化，而批量大小B的选择应基于累积DP噪声分析。跨任务使用固定的(C,B)设置会导致性能下降，特别是在隐私约束和计算资源变化时。裁剪可以视为梯度重新加权的一种形式，这一视角有助于理解其影响。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示的新算法，能够促进学习低维、任务相关的特征，并提高模型对扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征学习中往往没有明确区分显著和非显著特征，导致模型可能学习到与任务无关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 通过显式分解将显著和非显著特征分离到不同空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)来衡量输入与表示之间的依赖关系，并理论证明预测偏差的上界与显著子空间的维度和HSIC相关。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实验表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入成分，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过显式特征分解能够学习到更具任务相关性和鲁棒性的特征表示。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种公平感知生存建模方法FASM，通过解决生存分析中的组内和跨组风险排序偏差，在保持预测性能的同时显著提高公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用可能放大临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见，特别是在生存分析中，删失和时间动态使公平模型开发更加复杂。现有方法常忽视跨组排名差异，可能导致高风险黑人患者被排在低风险白人患者之后，加剧生物本质主义并损害公平护理。

Method: 提出FASM方法，旨在减轻关于组内和跨组风险排序的算法偏见。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，将FASM应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Result: FASM在保持与无公平意识生存模型相当的判别性能的同时，显著提高了公平性。时间分层评估显示FASM在10年时间范围内保持稳定的公平性，在随访中期观察到最大改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既注重准确性又注重公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning

varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化往往难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量（如JSD），但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新的紧致下界，并将其专门化到联合和边缘分布，证明了最大化JSD可以保证增加互信息的下界。同时重新审视了JSD目标的实践实现。

Result: 实验表明该下界在互信息估计中是紧致的，与最先进的神经估计器相比，提供了稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，并在信息瓶颈框架中展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的经验证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

TL;DR: xTime是一个用于时间序列极端事件预测的新框架，通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制，显著提升了极端事件的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列中的极端事件（如洪水、热浪、医疗紧急事件）具有重要实际意义，但现有模型往往因数据不平衡和忽略中间事件信息而难以准确预测这些事件。

Method: 提出xTime框架，利用知识蒸馏从较低稀有度事件训练的模型中转移信息，并引入专家混合(MoE)机制动态选择和融合不同稀有度级别的专家模型输出。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，xTime在极端事件上的预测准确率从3%提升到78%。

Conclusion: xTime框架通过知识蒸馏和MoE机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提高了预测性能。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合贝叶斯专家混合框架，结合物理路径损耗模型和CNN，通过对数线性池化融合，用于GNSS干扰源定位和RSS场重建，在城市场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS信号在城市环境中易受干扰，现有数据驱动方法定位效果尚可但RSS场重建较差，缺乏空间上下文信息。

Method: 混合贝叶斯专家混合框架：物理路径损耗专家确保物理一致性，CNN利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应，通过对数线性池化融合，采用拉普拉斯近似的贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验显示，随着训练点增加，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功融合物理模型和数据驱动方法，在GNSS干扰源定位和RSS场重建方面表现出优越性能，并能提供后验不确定性估计。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Motivation: 灵长类或人类神经数据稀缺，传统深度学习解码方法面临挑战，需要开发适用于小数据集的生物信息解码技术。

Method: 结合神经元特异性MEIs、结构相似性指数损失和对抗训练，构建生物信息解码模型。

Result: 在V1区单细胞活动重建视觉刺激方面达到最先进性能，特别是在小数据集上表现优异，仅需1,000-2,500个神经元和少于1,000个训练样本即可重建高保真自然图像。

Conclusion: 证明了早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Conclusion: 生成核心、交互循环和记忆系统是构建真正世界模型的关键要素，这条发展路径最具潜力。

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

TL;DR: Spikachu是一个基于脉冲神经网络(SNN)的可扩展、因果性和高能效的神经解码框架，在非人灵长类动物实验中表现优于因果基线模型，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍，同时支持多会话训练和少样本迁移学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑机接口(BCI)中的神经解码器面临两难选择：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然泛化好但难以实时应用。两者都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的真实系统中。

Method: 开发了Spikachu框架，直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间中，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示来生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时记录）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线模型，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍。多会话和跨被试训练可进一步提升性能，并实现对新会话、新被试和新任务的少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，其性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗降低数个数量级，为资源受限环境中的实时BCI应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Motivation: 旨在通过数据驱动方法更好地将JHFRAT跌倒风险预测与临床有意义的指标对齐，改进住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全。

Method: 采用约束评分优化(CSO)模型，基于JHFRAT评估数据和额外电子健康记录变量，分析54,209例住院患者数据，其中20,208例为高风险，13,941例为低风险。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT(AUC-ROC=0.91 vs 0.86)，虽然XGBoost模型性能更好(AUC-ROC=0.94)，但CSO在风险标注变化方面表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可利用数据驱动优化技术系统性增强住院患者跌倒预防协议和患者安全，改善风险评估和资源分配。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

Method: 训练了一个2.7亿参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在设计好的分布外场景中进行测试，包括规则外推和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型表现出组合泛化能力，能够一致地选择有效移动，在分布外谜题中生成高质量移动。在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，但与人对抗时差距较小。训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本组合结构，但在需要深度战略规划的复杂变体中仍不如基于显式搜索的符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了传统观点，证明在强化学习中，反向/正向KL散度的选择并不决定模式覆盖，而是定义了目标分布族。模式覆盖主要取决于正则化强度、奖励和参考概率的相对尺度等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为优化反向KL散度会导致"模式寻求"，而正向KL会导致"质量覆盖"，后者在需要从多个不同模式采样时更受青睐。但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习中并不适用。

Method: 通过数学分析和实证研究，构建了一个简单、可扩展且理论合理的算法。该算法对奖励幅度进行最小修改，优化目标分布使其在所有高质量采样模式上都有高概率。

Result: 实验表明，这种简单修改在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都有效，提高了解决方案的质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且同时适用于正向和反向KL散度。

Conclusion: 模式覆盖主要受正则化强度和其他因素影响，而非KL散度类型的选择。常用的低正则化强度和相等可验证奖励设置实际上指定了单峰目标分布，使得优化目标本质上缺乏多样性。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Abstract: Analyzing large complex image collections in domains like forensics, accident
investigation, or social media analysis involves interpreting intricate,
overlapping relationships among images. Traditional clustering and
classification methods fail to adequately represent these complex
relationships, particularly when labeled data or suitable pre-trained models
are unavailable. Hypergraphs effectively capture overlapping relationships, but
to translate their complexity into information and insights for domain expert
users visualization is essential. We propose an interactive visual analytics
approach specifically designed for the construction, exploration, and analysis
of hypergraphs on large-scale complex image collections. Our core contributions
include: (1) a scalable pipeline for constructing hypergraphs directly from raw
image data, including a similarity measure to evaluate constructed hypergraphs
against a ground truth, (2) interactive visualization techniques that integrate
spatial hypergraph representations, interactive grids, and matrix
visualizations, enabling users to dynamically explore and interpret
relationships without becoming overwhelmed and disoriented, and (3) practical
insights on how domain experts can effectively use the application, based on
evaluation with real-life image collections. Our results demonstrate that our
visual analytics approach facilitates iterative exploration, enabling domain
experts to efficiently derive insights from image collections containing tens
of thousands of images.
